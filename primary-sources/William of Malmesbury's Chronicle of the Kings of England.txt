EDITOR'S PREFACE. 



•* WiuJAM of Malmesburt," according to archbishop Usher, \ « 
** is the chief of oar historians ;" Leland records him '* as an 
elegant, learned, and faithful historian ;" and Sir Henrj 
Saville is of opinion, that he is the only man of his time who ) 
has discharged his trust as an historian. His History of the 
[Kings of England was translated into English bj the Bey. 
John Sharpe, and published in quarto, in 1815. 

Though the language of Mr. Sharpe's work is by no means 
ao smooth as the dialect of the present day would require, 
' yet the care with which he examined MSS., and endeavoured 
to give the exact sense of his author, seemed so important a 
reoommendation, that the editor of the present volume has 
gladly availed himself of it as a ground-work for his own 
labours. The result of this plan is, that the public are en- 
abled to purchase without delay and at an insignificant 
expense, the valuable contemporary historian, who has 
hitherto been like a sealed book to the public, or only acces- 
sible through a bulky volume, the scarcity of which served 
to exclude it from aU but public libraries or the studies of 
the wealthy. 

But the translation of Mr. Sharpe has by no means been re- 
printed verbatim. Within the last ten years a valuable 
edition of the original text, with copious collations of MSS., 
has been published by the English Historical Society. This 
edition has been compared with the translation, and numerous 
passages retouched and improved. Some charters, also, have 
been added, and a large number of additional notes appended 
at the foot of the pages, together with a few other improve- 
ments and additions calculated to render this interesting his- 
tory more acceptable to the reading public 

J. A. G. 
Bampton^ June, 1847. 



THE 



TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE. 



The author whose work is here presented to the public in 
Ml English dress, has, unfortunately, left few facts of a per- 
sonal nature to be recorded of him ; and even these can onlj 
be casuallj gleaned from his own writings. It is indeed 
much to be regretted that he who wrote so well on such a 
▼arietj of topics, should have told so little to gratify the 
curiosity of his readers with respect to himself. Every 
notice of such an ardent lover of literature as Malmesbury, 
must have been interesting to posterity, as a desire to be 
acquainted with the history of those who have contributed to 
our instruction or amusement seems natural to civilized man. 
With the exception indeed of the incidental references made 
by successive chroniclers, who borrowed ifrom his history, 
there is nothing to be learned of him from extrinsic sources 
till the time of Leland, who indignantly observes, that even 
at Malmesbury, in his own monastery, they had nearly lost 
all remembrance of their brightest ornament. 

To himself then we are indebted for the knowledge of his 
being descended from both English and Norman parents Vhis 
father having probably comi"^lther ^t the conquest. The 
exact time of his birth cannot be ascertained ; though per- 
haps an approximation to it may be made. In the '* Com- 
mentary on Jeremiah,"* Malmesbury observes, that he " had 
long since, in his youthful days, amused himself with writing 
history, that he was now forty years of age ;" and, in another 
place, he mentions a circumstance which occurred '^ in the 

* ** Olim enim cum hUtqrias /tin, Tuidioiibus annis rermnque Isetitiai 
coogniebat renim jocunditas. Nunc staa progreBsior, et fortune deterior, 
aliud dicendi geniu expostulant. Quadrojfmarint turn hodie,*^ &c. ProU 
in expoi. Thren. Hierem. MS. BodU 868. 



translator's PRSFACE. Vli 

time of king Henry ;*** apparentlj implying that Henry wbb 
then dead. Now, admitting the expression of " long since" 
to denote a period often years, this, as his ^* Histories of the 
Kmgs" and ** of the PrcJates" were completed in the year 
1 125, mnst have heen written about 1 135, the time of Heniy's 
death, and would of course place his own birth about 1095 

orl096.t 

The next circumstance to be noticed is, that when a boy, 
he was placed in the monastery whence he derived his name, 
where in due time he became librarian, and, according to 
Leland, precentor ; and ultimately refused the dignity of 
abhat His death is generally supposed to have taken place 
about 1143; though it is probable that he survived this 
period some time : for his " Modem History^ terminates at 
the end of the year 1142 ; and it will appear, from a manu- 
script hereafter to be described, that he lived at least long 
enough after its publication to make many corrections, altera- 
tions, and insertions, in that work as well in the other por- 
tions of his History. 

With these facts, meagre as they are, the personal account 
of him must close. But with regard to hiB literary bent 
and attainments there is ample store of information in his 
writings. From his earliest youth he gave his soul to study, 
and to the collecting of books ;} ai^d he visited many of the 
most celebrated monasteri^ in the kingdom, apparently in 
prosecution of this darling propensity. The ardour of his 
curiosity, and the unceasing diligence of his researches, in 
this respect, have perhaps been seldom surpassed. He seems 
to have procured every volume within his reach ; and to 
have carefully examined and digested its contents, whether 

* ** Iits antem avis (rtnithio) membrorum grandium, peniuu quidem 
haben^ aed volatu carens. Qualem in Angli& yidimiu^ tempore regit 
ffemiei exterDomin monstronim appetentisBimi.'' Ch. iv. y. 81. 

f He has afforded another notice of time, but not equally predse. 
Godfrey is laid to have been abbst of Malmesbury from the year 1084 till 
1 105 ; and MalmeBboiy mentiona certain tranaactions which took place in 
Godfrey*! time as beyond his memoiy; and otbera which happened when 
he was a boy. Angiia Sacra, II. 45—7. If Malmesbuiy wrote the mira- 
eles of St Andrew, a work wUch is attributed to him, he was bom the 30th 
of NoTonber. 

X He says he also collected many books for the monastic librazy : and 
nentioBis others which he had seen at Canterbury, Buiy St, Edmunds, &#. 
iiaJe, torn. iii« pp. 876, 298. 



viii trakslatob's preface. 

divinity, history, biography, poetry, or classical literature. Of 
his acquirements as a scholar it is indeed difficult to speak in 
terms of sufficient commendation. That he had accurately 
\ studied nearly all the Roman authors, will be readily 
allowed by the classical reader of his works. From these he 
either quotes or inserts so appositely, as to show how 
thoroughly he had imbibed their sense and spirit. His adapta- 
tions are ever ready and appropriate ; they incorporate with 
his narrative with such exactness that they appear only to 
/ occupy their legitimate place. His knowledge of Greek is 
not equally apparent ; at least his references to the writers 
of Greece are not so frequent, and even these might proba- 
bly be obtained from translations : irom this, however, no 
conclusion can be drawn that he did not understand the lan- 
guage. With respect to writers subsequent to those deemed 
classics, his range was so extensive that it is no easy matter 
to point out many books which he had not seen, and cer- 
tainly he had perused several which we do not now possess. 

Mahnesbury^s love o f learnin g was c opatj^utional : he de- 
clares m one oi nii^ piHifUUBB, lllUl had He turned to any other 
than literary pursuits, he should have deemed it not only 
disgraceful, but even detrimental to his better interest. 
Again, his commendations of Bede show how much he vene- 
rated a man of congenial inclinations and studies ; and how 
anxious he was to form himself on the same model of accu- 
rate investigation and laborious research, and to snatch every 
possible interval from the performance of his monastic duties, 
for the purposes of information and improvement. 

His industry and application were truly extraordinary. 
Even to the moment when we reluctantly lose sight of him, 
he is discovered unceasingly occupied in the correction of 
his works.* In the MSS. of the " History of the Kings " 

• Some notion of his diligence maj perhaps be afforded by the following 
list of hJB writingii. 

1. J>e Gtatis Begum, The Higtorf of the Kmgs of England. The fint 
three hooks were probably written soon after the year 1 120. Malmesbnry 
intimates that he then hentated for a time on the expediency of continuing 
his history ; but at length having determined on prosecuting his design, he 
dedicated the fourth and fifth books to Robert earl of Gloucester ; at whose 
request he afterwards oompoiSed

may be found traces of at least four several editions ; and 
the "HistoTy of the Prelates" supplies nearly as many 
varieties. And thongh it may reasonably be imagined that 

3. De GesHa Pontificum. The Histoiy of the Prelates of England con- 
taming, in four books, an account of the bishope, and of the principal 
monasteriea, firom the conyeraion of the English, by St. Augustiney to 
1123 : to which he added a fifth 

4. be Vila Aldhehm. The Life of St. Aldhehn : which was completed in 
1125. It is my reasonably conjectured that this last was published aepa- 
lately and some time after the others ; as, though there are many ancient 
MSS. of the first four books, one copy only has yet been discoTered with the 
fifth. The former were published by Sarille, but from very &ulty and scanty 
MS& The latter by H. Wharton* and by Gale ; but also very defectively. 

5. De Vita S. Dumtani. The Life of S. Dunstan, in two books. MS. 
Bodley Rawlxnaon, 263. This was written at the request of the monks of 
Glastonbury, for whom, he had previously composed the following three : 

6. rUa S. Pairidi. The Life of S. Patrick, in two books. Lehind, 
Collectanea, 3, 272, has extracts fiom it, but no MS. has hitherto 
oocuired. 

7. Mtraeuia S. Benigm. The Miracles of S. Benignus. This has not 
occurred.

Abbreviated in Capgrave's Legenda Nova.

after 1129. Printed in Grale's Collection, t 3, and by Heame, from an 
interpolated MS. — , ^_ _^ — . 

10. Ttta S. Wvistani Epiteopi Wigomienns, The Life of S. Wulstan,

Prior Guarin, between 1124 and 1140. The greater part of it has been 
printed. Anglia Sacra, t. 2. 

11. Chronica, Chronicles^ in three books. Seep. 480. This work is 
probably lost. 

>2. Miracula S. Elfg\f<B, The Miracles of Elfgifii, in metre. A 
spechnen of these rhymes, there printed as prose, may be seen in the 
De Gestis Ponti£ £ 143 : they were apparently written while he was very 
young ; as, before 1125, he says, *^ quondam cecinL" 

13. JHnerariam Joanme AMnxiis Meldunensis versut Hamam, The 
Itinerary of John Abbat of Malmesbury to Rome. This was drawn up, 
after 1140, from, the relation of another monk of that foundation who 
accompanied the abbet. Leland, Collect. 3, 272, ed. 1774, mentions it as 
being very curious. It does not occur, but it was formerly in the possession 
of Bale.

a great portion of tHe alterations are merely yerbal,- and of 
course imperceptible in a translation, jet they contribute in an 
extraordinary degree to the polish and elegance of his style.* 
Another excellent feature of Malmesbury's literary character 
is, his l<ffe^of truth. He repeatedly declares that, in the 
remoter periods of his work, he had observed the most 
guarded caution in throwing all responsibility, for the 
facts he mentions, on the authors from whom he derived 
them ; and in his own times he avers, that he has recorded 

^ nothing that he had not either personally witnessed, or 
learned from the most credible authority. Adhering closely 
to this principle, he seems to have been fully impressed with 
the difficulty of relating the transactions of the princes, hia 

. contemporaries, and on this account he repeatedly apologizes 
for his omissions. But here is seen his dexterous management 
in maintaining an equipoise between their virtues and vices ; 
for he spares neither William the First, nor his sons who 
succeeded him : indeed several of his strictures in the earlier 
editions of this work, are so severe, that he afterwards found 
it necessary to modify and soften them. 

His character and attainments had early acquired a high 
degree of reputation among his contemporaries. He was 
entreated by the monks of various monasteries to write either 
the history of their foundations, or the lives of their patron 
saints. He associated with persons of the highest consequence

* These remarks on the character and style of our author must be 
received, as they say, cum grano salts. They more justly evince the zeal 
of Mr. Sharpe than the merits of Malmesbury^ composition. The classical 
reader will probably lament with me that our early historians should have 
used a style so cumbersome and uninvituig. To this general censure 
Malmesbury is certainly no exception. His Ladnity is rude and repulsive, 
and the true value of his writings arises from Uie fidelity with which he has 
recorded facts, which he had ei^er himself witnessed or bad obtained from 
eye-witnesses.

and aathority ; and in one instance, at least, he took a share 
in the important political transactions of his own times. 
Robert earl of Gloucester, the natural son of Henry the 
First, was the acknowledged friend and patron of MsJmes-^ 
bury. This distinguished nobleman, who was himself a 
profound scholar, seems to have been the chief promoter 
of learning at that period. Several portions of our author's 
work are dedicated to him, not merely through motives of 
personal regard, but irom the conviction that his attainments 
ta a sdiolar would lead him to appreciate its value as a com- 
position, and the part which he bore in the transactions 
of his day, enable him to decide on the veracity of its 
relation. 

Having mus stated the leading features of Malmesbur/s 
life^ his avocations and attainments, it may not be irrelevant 
to consider the form and manner which he has adopted in 
the history before us. A desire to be acquainted with the 
transactions of their ancestors seems natural to men in every 
stage of society, however rude or barbarous. The northern 
nations, more especially, had their historical traditions, and 
the songs of their bard^ from the remotest times. Influenced 
by this feeling, the Anglo-Saxons turned their attention to 
the composition of annab very early after their settlement in ' 
Britain ; and hence originated that invaluable register the 
Saxon Chronicle,* in which facts are briefly related as 
they arose ;-i— in chronolc^cal order^ indeed^ but without 
compient or observation. After the Norman conquest, 
fflHohg other objects of studious research in England, history 
attracted considerable attention, and the form, as wedl as the ' 
matter, of the Saxon Chronicle, became the prevailing 
standard. It might readily be supposed that Mahnesbury's' 
genius and attainments would with difficulty submit to the ' 
shackles of a mere chronological series, which afforded no 
field for the exercise of genius or judgment Accordingly, 
fbOowing the bent of his inclination, he struck into a different 
and freer path ; and to a judicious selection of facts gave the 
added chum of wisdom and experience. It may therefore 
be useful to advert to the exemplification of this principle in 
the scope and design of the work immediately before us. His

first book comprises the exploits of tHe Anglo-Saxons, from 
th« period of their arrival till the consolidation of the empire 
under the monarchy of Egbert Herein too is separately 
given the history of those powerful but rival kingdoms, 
which alternately subjugated, or bowed down to the 
dominion of, each other, and deluged the country with 
blood, as the love of conquest or the lust of ambition 
prompted. The second portion of the work continues the 
regal series till the mighty revolution of the Norman 
conquest. The three remaining books are occupied with 
the reigns of William and his sons, including a very 
interesting accoimt of the first Cru^de. His Modem 
History carries the narrative into the turbulent reign 
cf Stephen. 

Such is the period embraced: and to show these times, 
*^ their form and pressure," Malmesbury collected every 
thing within his reach. His materials, as he often feelingly 
laments, were scanty and confined, more especially in the 
earlier annals. The Chronicles of that era afforded him but 
little, yet of tiiat little he has made the most, through the 
diligence of his research and the soundness of his judgment. 
His discrimination in selecting, and his skill in arranging, 
are equally conspicuous. His inexhaustible patience, his 
learning, his desire to perpetuate every thing interesting or 
useful, are at all times evident. Sensibly alive to the de- 
ficiencies of the historians who preceded him, he constantly 
endeavours to give a clear and connected relation of every 
event Indeed, nothing escaped his observation which could 
, tend to elucidate the manners of the times in which he wrote. 
History was the darling pursuit of Malmesbury, and more 
especially biographical history, as being, perhaps, the most 
pleasing mode of conveying information. He knew the pre- 
vailing passion of mankind for %necdote, and was a skilful 
master in blending amusement with instruction. Few his- 
torians ever possessed such power of keeping alive the 
reader^s attention; few so ably managed their materials, or 
scattered so many fiowers by the way. Of his apt delinea- 
tion of character, and happy mode of seizing the most promi- 
nent features of his personages, it is difficult to speak in 
terms of adequate doraimendation. He does not weary with 
a tedious detail, " line upon line,** nor does he complete his 



tilinslaior's preface. xiii 

portrait at a sitting. On the contrary, the traits are scat- 
tered, the proportions disunited, the body dismembered, as it 
were ; but in a moment some master-stroke is applied, some 
Yivid flash of Promethean fire animates the canvass, and the 
perfect figure darts into life and expression : hence we have 
the surly, ferocious snail of the Conqueror, and the brutal 
horse-laugh of Rufus. Mahnesbury's history, indeed, may 
be called a kind of biographical drama ; where, by a skilful 
gradation of character and variety of personage, the story is 
presetted entire, though the tediousness of continued narra- 
tive is aToided. Again, by saying little on uninteresting 
topics, and dilating on such as are important, the tale, which 
might else disgust from the supineness or degeneracy of some 
principal actor, Ls artfully relieved by the force of contrast : 
and the mind, which perhaps recoils with indignation firom 
the stupid indifTerence of an Ethelred, hangs, with fond de- 
light, on the enterprising spirit and exertion of an Ironside. 

It may be superfluous, perhaps, aB:er enumerating qualities 
of this varied kind, in an author, who gives a connected his- 
tory of England for several centuries, to observe, that readers 
cf every description must derive instruction and delight from 
Ms labours. Historians, antiquaries, or philosophers, may 
drink deeply of the stream which pervades his work, and 
find their thirst for information gratified. The diligent 
investigator of the earlier annals of his own country, finds a 
pe riod of seven hundredj'ears submitted to his inspection, 
anJT this'not merely In a dry detail of events, but in a series 
of attthentic historical facts, determined with acuteness, com- 
mitted on with deliberation, and relieved by pleasing anec- 
dote or interesting episode. When the narrative flags at 
home, the attention is roused by events transacting abroad, 
while foreign is so blended wi1±L domestic history, that the 
book is never dosed in disgust. The antiquary here finds 
ample field for amusement and instruction in the various 
notices of arts, manners, and customs, which occur. The 
philosopher traces the gradual progress of man towards civil- 
ization; watches his mental improvement, his advance from 
barbarism to comparative refinement ; and not of man alone, 
but of goTermnent^ laws, and arts, as well as of all those 
attainments which serve to exalt and embellish human na- 
toie. These are topics carefully, though perhaps only inci-

dentally, brought forward; but they are points essentially 
requisite in every legitimate historian. Here, however, it 
must be admitted, that in the volume before us, a consider- 
able portion of the marvellous prevails ; and though, perhaps, 
by many readers, these will be considered as among the most 
curious parts of the work, yet it may be objected, that the 
numerous miraculous tales, detract, in some measure, from 
that soundness of judgment which has been ascribed to our 
author. dBut it should be carefully recollected, that it became 
necessary to conform, in some degree, to the general taste of 
the readers of those days, the bulk of whom derived their 
principal amusement from the lives of saints, and from their 
miracles, in which they piously believed: besides, no one 
ever thouglit of impeaching the judgment of Livy, or of any 
other historian of credit, for insertions of a similar nature. 
Even in these relations, however, Malmesbuiy is careful that 
^ his own veracity shall not be impeached ; constantly observ- 
f.ing, that the truth of the story must rest on the credit of his 
'lauthors; and, indeed, they are always so completely sepa- 
rable fix>m the main narrative, that there is no danger of 
mistaking the legend for history. 

Having thus noticed the multifarious topics embraced bj 
Malmesbuiy, it may be necessary to advert to his style: 
although, after what has been premised, it might seem almost 
superfluous to add, that it admits nearly of as much variety 
as his facts. This probably arises from that undeviating 
principle which he appears to have laid down, that his chief 
efforts should be exerted to give pleasure to his readers ; in 
imitation of the rhetoricians, whose first object was to make 
their audience kindly disposed, next attentive, and finally 
anxious to receive instruction.* Of his style, therefore, 
generally speaking, it may not be easy to give a perfect 
description. To say to which Roman author it bea^ the 
nearest resemblance, when he imitated almc^t every one of 
them, from Sallust to Eutropius, would be rash indeed. 
How shall we bind this classical Proteus, who occasionally 
assumes the semblance of Persius, Juvenal, Horace, Lucan, 
Virgil, Lucretius; and who never appears in his proper 
shape so long as he can seize the form of an ancient classic Ff 

* See his prologue to the Life of Wulstan, Anglia Sacra, ii. 243.

Often does he dedare that he purposelj yaries his dicticmy 
lest the reader should be disgust^ by its sameness; anx- 
iously careful to avoid repetition, even in the structure of his 
phrases. It may be said, howeyer, that generally, in his 
eailier works, (for he was apparently yery young when he 
wrote his History of the Kings,) his style is rather laboured ; 
though, perhaps, eyen this may haye originated in an anxiety 
that his descriptions should be full ; or, to use his own ex- 
pression, that posterity should be wholly and perfectly in- 
fanned. That his diction is highly antithetical, and hiSt, 
sentences artfully poised, will be readily allowed; and per- 
hi^ps the best index to his meaning, where he may be occa- 
sionally obscure, is the nicely-adjusted balance of his phrase. 
That he gradually improved his style, and in riper years, 
where he describes the transactions of his own times, became 
terse, el^ant, and polished, no one will attempt to dispute ; 
and it wiU be regretted, that this interesting portion of his- 
tory should break off abruptly in the midst of the contest 
between the empress Maud and Stephen. 

In this recapitulation perhaps enough has been said to 
make an attempt at translating such an author regarded with 
kindness and complacency. To prevent a work of such ac- 
knowledged intent and fidelity from remaining longer a 
sealed book to the English reader, may well justify an under- 
taking of this kind ; and it should be remarked that a trans- 
lation of Malmesbury may serve to difiiise a very different 
idea of the state of manners and learning in his days from 
that which has been too commonly entertained ; and at the 
same time to rescue a set of very deserving men from the 
unjust obloquy with which they have been pursued for ages. 
For without the least design of vindicating the institutions 
of mohachism or overlooking the abuses incident to it, we 
may assert that, in Malmesbiury's time, religious houses were \ 
the grand depositaries of knowledge, and monks the best > 
informed men of the age. 

It remains briefly to speak of the mode in which the trans- 
lation has been conducted. The printed text of Malmesbury * 

* A oonnderable portion of the preflent work was printed anonjmoiul/ 
ai a continuation of Bede, at Heideiberg, in 1587. The whole, together 
with the History of the Prelates, was first printed by Sir Henry S^villo, 
who appears to hare consulted sevend copies in the ^'Scriptores pest

was found so freqaentlj j&ultj and corrupted that^ on a careful 
perusal, it was deemed necessary to seek for authentic manu- 
scripts. These were supplied by that noble institution, the 
British Museum; but one more especially, which, on an 
exact comparison with others, was found to possess indisput- 
able ^proofs of the author's latest corrections. This, Bib. 
Reg. 13, D. n, has been collated throughout with the 
printed copy ; the result has produced numerous important 
corrections, alterations, and insertions, which are constantly 
referred to in the notes. In addition to this, various other 
MSS. have been repeatedly consulted ; so that it is presumed 
the text, from which the translation has been made, is, by 
these means, completely established. 

As the plan pursued by Malmesbury did not oiten require 
him to affix dates to the several transactions, it has been 
deemed necessary to remedy this omission. The chronology 
here supplied has been constructed on a careful examination 
and comparison of the Saxon Chronicle and Florence of 
Worcester, which are considered the best authorities; 
although even these occasionally leave considerable doubt 
as to the precise time of certain events. The remoteness 
of the period described by Malmesbury makes notes also in 
some measure indispensable. These are derived as frequently 
as possible from contemporary authors. Their object is 
briefly to amend, to explain, and to illustrate. By some per- 
haps they may be thought too limited ; by others they may 
occasionally be considered unnecessary ; but they are such as 
were deemed likely to be acceptable to readers in general. 

With these explanations the translator takes leave of the 
reader, and is induced to hope that the present work will 
not be deemed an unimportant accession to the stock of 
English literature.

throughout all the MSS.

anything worthy of remembrance ; your exertions incite us 

to make you live for ever in our writings, in return for the 

dangers you undergo to secure our tranquillity. For this

2 THE author's EFISTLE. 

I^one, surelj, can be a more suitable patron of the liberal 
arts than yourself, in whom are combined the magnanimity 
of your grandfather, the munificence of your uncle, the cir- 
cumspection of your father ; more especially as you add to 
the qualities of these men, whom you alike equal in industry 
and resemble in person, this peculiar characteristic, a devo- 
tion to learning. Nor is this all : you condescend to honour 
with your notice those literary characters who are kept in 
obscurity, either by the malevolence of fame, or the slender- 
ness of their fortune. And as our nature inclines us, not to 
condemn in others what we approve in ourselves, therefore 
men of learning find in you manners congenial to their own ; 
for, without the slightest indication of moroseness, you re- 
gard them with kindness, admit them with complacency, and 
dismiss them with regret. Indeed, the greatness of your 
fortune has made no difference in you, except that your 
beneficence can now almost keep pace with your inclination. 
Accept) then, most illustrious Sir, a work in which you 
may contemplate yourself as in a glass, where your High- 
ness's sag&city wiU discover that you have imitated the 
actions of the most exalted characters, even before you could 
have heard their names. The Preface to the first book de- 
clares the contents of this work ; on deigning to peruse 
which, you will briefly collect the whole subject-matter. 
Thus much I must request from your Excellency, that no 
blame may attach to me because my narrative often wanders 
wide firom the limits of our own country, since I design this 
as a compendium of many histories, although, with a view to 
the larger portion of it, I have entitled it a History of the 
Kings of England. 



PREFACE. 



The historj of the English, from their arrival in Britain to 
his own times, has heen written by Bede, a man of singular 
learning and modesty, in a clear and captivating style. 
After him you wiU not, in my opinion, easily find any person 
who has attempted to compose in Latin the history of this 
peopla Let others declare whether their researches in this 
respect have been, or are likely to be, more fortunate ; my 
own labour, though diligent in the extreme, has, down to this 
period, been without its reward. There, are, indeed, some 
notices of antiquity, written in the vernacular tongue after 
the manner of a cjironide,* and arranged according to the 
years of our XA>rd. By means of these alone, the times suc- 
ceeding this man have been rescued from oblivion : for of 
Elward,! ^ noble and illustrious man, who attempted to 
arrange these chronicles in Latin, and whose intention I 
oould applaud if his language did not disgust me, it is 
better to be silent. Nor has it escaped my knowledge, that 
there is also a work of my Lord Eadmer,f written with a 
chastened elegance of style, in which, beginning from King 
^^IgBr, he has but hastiiy glanced at the ^imes down to 
Will]ttn*the First : and thence, taking a freer range, gives a 
narrative, copious, and of great utility to the studious, until

country, as respect for ^e authority of those who have en- 
joined on me the undertaking, to fill up the chasm, and to 
season the crude materials with Roman art And that the 
work may proceed with greater regularity, I shall ouU some- 
what from Bede, whom 1 must often quote, glandng at a few 
facts, but omitting more. 

The First Book, therefore, contains a 6nccin<^ aooount of 
the English, from the time of their descent on Britain, till 
that of King Egbert, who, after the different Princes had fallen 
by various ways, gained the monarchy of almost the whole 
i^and. 

But as among the English arose four powerful kingdoms^ 
that is to say, of Kent, of the West Saxons, of tha Northum- 
brians, and of the Mercians, of which I purpose severaUj to 
treat if I hare leisure ; I shall begin with that which attained 
the earliest to maturity, and was also the first to deoay. 
This I shall do more clearly, if I place the kingdoms of the 
East Angles, and of the East Saxons, after the others^ as 
little meriting either my labours, or the regard of posterity^ 

The Second Book will contain the chronological series of 
the Kings to the coming of the Normans. 

The three following Books will be employed upon the 
history of thre# successive kings, with the addition of wliat- 
ever, in their times, happened elsewhere, which^ from its 
ccilebrity, may demand a more particular notice. This, then, 
is what I purpose, if the Divine favour shall smile on my 
undertaking, and carry me safely by those rocks of rugged 
diction, on which Elwa^ in his search after sounding and far- 
fetched phrases, so imhappily suffered shipwreck. ** Should 
any one, however," to use the poet's expression,* ^* peruse thi» 
work with sensible delight,** I deem it necessary to aoquaint 
him, that I vouch nothing for the truth of long past trans- 
actions, but the consonance of the time ; the veracity of the 
relation must rest with its authors. Whatever I have re- 
corded of later times, I have either myself seen, or heard 
from credible authority. However, in either part, I pay but 
little respect to the judgment of my contemporaries : trust- 
ing that I shall gain with posterity, when love and hatred 
shall be no more, if not a reputation for eloquence, at least 
credit for diligence.

THE HISTORY 



or TBB 



KINGS OF ENGLAND. 



BOOK I. 
CHAPTER I. 

0/ C&tf arrival <ij the Anplu, and of the Kings qf Kent. [a.d. 449.] 



Li the jear of the incarnation of our Lord 449, Angles and 

Saxons Arst came into Britain ; and although the cause oi 

their arriTal is universallj known, it may not be improper 

here to subjoin it : and, that the design of mj work may be 

the more manifest, to begin even from an earlier period. 

That Britain, compelled by Julius Csesar to submit to the 

Roman power, was held in high estimation bj that people, 

may be eoUected from their history, and be seen also in the 

rains of their ancient buildings. Even their «mperors, 

sovereigns of almost all the world, eagerly embraced oppor- 

tonities of sailing hither, and of spending their days here. 

RnaUy, Severus and Constantius, two of their greatest 

princes, died upon the island, and were there interred with 

the ntmost pomp. The former, to defend this province from 

the incursions of the barbarians, built his celebrated and 

well-known wall from sea to sea. The latter, a man, as they 

report^ of courteous manners, left Constantine, his son by 

Helena, a tender of cattle,* a youth of great promise, his 

* Helena*! origm has been much contested : Gibbon decides that she 
was daughter of an innkeeper. The word ** Stabularia,** Utenlly implies 
an ostler-weDeh ; and it has been conjectured that it was applied to her, bj 
the Jews and G^tiles, on accoant of her building a church on the spot 
where stood the stable in which our Lord was bom.

heir. Constantine, greeted emperor hj the armj, led away, 
in an expedition destined to the continent, a numerous force 
of British soldiers ; by whose exertions, the war succeeding 
to his wishes, he gained in a short time the summit of power. 
For these veterans, when their toil was over, he founded a 
colony on the western coast of Guul, where, to this day, their 
descendants, somewhat degenerate in language and manners 
from our own Britons, remain with wonderful increase.* 

In succeeding times, in this island, Maximus, a man well- 
fitted for command, had he not aspired to power in defiance of 
his oath, assumed the purple, as though compelled by the 
army, and preparing immediately to pass over into Graul, he 
despoiled the province of almost all its military force. Not 
long after also, one Constantine, who had been elected em- 
peror on account of his name, drained its whole remaining 
warlike strength ; but both being slain, the one by Theodo- 
sius, the other by Honorius, they became examples of the 
instability of human greatness. Of the forces which had 
followed them, part shared the fate of their leaders ; the rest^ 
after their defeat, fled to the continental Britons. Thus 
when the tyrants had left none but half-savages in the 
country, and, in the towns, those only who were given up to 
luxury, Britain, despoiled of the support of its youthful! 
population, and bereft of every useful art, was for a long time 
exposed to the ambition of neighbouring nations. 

For immediately, by an excursion of the Scots and Picts, 
numbers of the people were slain, villages burnt, J towns de- 
stroyed, and everything laid waste by fire and sword. Fart 
of the harassed islanders, who thought anything more ad- 
visable than contending in battle, fled for safety to the moun- 
tains ; others, burying their treasures in the earth, many of 
which are dug up in our own times, proceeded to Rome to ask 
assistance. The Romans, touched with pity, and deeming it 
above all things important to yield succour to their oppressed 
allies, twice lent their aid, and defeated the enemy. But at 
length, wearied with the distant voyage, they declined re- 
turning in future ; bidding them rather themselves not

degenerate from the martial energy of their ancestors, but 
ieani to defend their country with spirit, and with arms. 
They accompanied their advice with the plan of a wall, to be 
bnUt for their defence ; the mode of hoping watch on the 
ramparts ; of sallying out against the enemy, should it be 
necessary, together with other duties of military discipline. 
After giving these admonitions, they departed, accompanied 
by the tears of the miserable inhjAbitants ; and Fortune, 
smiling on their departure, restored them to their friends and 
country. The Scots, learning the improbability of their re- 
turn, immediately began to make fresh and more frequent 
irrupti<»i8 against the Britons ; to level their wall, to kill the 
few opponents they met with, and to carry off considerable 
booty ; while such as escaped fled to the royal residence, 
imploring the protection of their sovereign. 

At this time Yortigem was King of Britain ; a man calcu- 
lated neither for the field nor the council, but wholly given 
up to the lusts of the flesh, the slave of every vice : a cha- 
racter of insatiable avarice, ungovernable pride, and polluted 
by his lusts. To complete the picture, as we read in the 
History of the Britons, he had defiled his own daughter, who 
was limd to the participation of such a crime by the hope of 
sharing his kingdom, and she had borne him a son. Regard- 
less of his treasures at this dreadful juncture, and wasting 
the resources of the kingdom in riotous living, he was awake 
only to the blandishments of abandoned women. Boused at 
length, however, by the clamours of the people, he summoned 
a council, to take the sense of his nobility on the state of 
public affairs. To be brief, it was unanimously resolved to 
invite over from Germany the Angles and Saxons, nations 
powerful in arms, but of a roving life. It was conceived 
that this would be a double advantage : for it was thought 
that, by their skill in war, these people would easily subdue 
their enemies ; and, as they hitherto had no certain habita- 
tion, would gladly accept even an unproductive soil, provided 
it afforded them a stationary residence. Moreover, that they 
could not be suspected of ever entertaining a design against 
the country, since the remembrance of this kindness would 
soften their native ferocity. This counsel was adopted, and 
ambassadors, men of rank, and worthy to represent the 
oountry, were sent into Grermany. 



8 WILUAX OF MALKEfiBUST. [&e.o;1. 

The GermanB, hearing llutt vdiimtarily offered, whldK 
they had long anxiouiBlj desired, readily obeyed the invita- 
tion ; their joy quickening their haste. Bidding adieu, 
therefore, to their native fidds and the ties of kindred, th^ 
spread their saibi to Fortune, and, with a favouring faraeoBe, 
arrived in Britain in three of those long vessels whioh they 
call ^ oeds.''* At this and other times came over a mixed 
multitude from three of the Grennan nations ; that is to say, 
the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes. For almost all the cotmtry 
lying to the north of the British ocean, though divided into 
many provinces, is justly denominated Greraany, from its 
germinating so many men. And tis the pruner cuts off the 
more luxuriant branches of the tree to impart a livelier 
vigour to the remainder, so the inhabitants of this country 
assist their common parent by the expulsion of a part ci 
their members, lest she should perish by giving sustenance 
to too numerous an o&pring ; but in order to obviate dia-* 
eontent, they cast lots who shall be compelled to migrate. 
Hence the men of this country have made a virtue of 
necessity, and, when driven from their native soil, they have 
gained foreign settlements by force of arms. The Vandals, 
for instance, who formerly over-ran Africa ; the Goths, who 
made themselves, masters of Spain ; the Lombards, who^ even 
at the present time, are settled in Italy ; and the Normans, 
who have given their own name to that part of Gaul which 
they subdued. From Germany, then, there first came into 
Britain, an inconsiderable number indeed, but well able to 
make up for their paucity by their courage. These were 
under the conduct of Hengist and Horsa, two brothers of 
suitable disposition, and of noble race in their own country. 
They were great-grandsons of the celebrated Woden, firom 
whom almost all the royal families of these barbarous nations 
deduce their origin ; and to whom the nations of the Angles, 
fondly deifying him, have consecrated by immemorial super- 
stition the fourth day of the week, as they have the Mxth to 
his wife Frea. Bede has related in what particular parts of

Britain, the Angles, Saxons, and Jntes,* fixed their habita- 
tioiis : my design, however, is not to dilate, though there/ 
mar be abundance of materials for the purpose, but to toucW 
only an what is necessary. ' 

The Angles were eagerly met on aU sides upon thdir 
arrival : from the king thej received thanks, from the people 
expressions of good-will. Faith was plighted on either side, 
and the Isle of Thanet appropriated for their residence. It 
was agreed, moreover, that thev should exert their prowess 
in arms for the service of the country ; and, in return, 
receive a suitable reward from the people for whose safety 
they underwent such painful labours. Ere Icmg, the Scots 
advanced, as usual, secure, as they supposed, of a great booty 
with very little difficulty. However, the Angles assailed 
them, and scarcely had they engaged, before they were put to 
flighty whilst the cavalry pursued and destroyed the fugitives. 
Contests of this kind were frequent, and victory constantly 
siding with the Angles, as is customary in human affairs, 
while success inflamed the courage of one party, and dread 
increased the cowardice of the other, the Scots in the end 
avoided nothing so cautiously as an engagement with them. 

In the meantime, Hengist, not less keen in perception 
than ardent in the field, with consent of Yortigem, sends 
back some of his followers to his own country, vnth the 
secret purpose, however, of representing the Indolence of the 
king and people, the opulence of the island, and the prospect 
of advantage to new adventurers. Having executed their 
commission adroitly, in a short time they return with sixteen 
ships, bringing with them the daughter of Hengist ; a 
maiden, as we have heard, who might ]ustly be called the 
master-piece of nature and the admiration of mankind. At 
an entertainment, provided for them on their return, Hen* 
gist commanded his daughter to assume the office of cup« 
bearer, that she might gratify the eyes of the king as he sat 
at table. Nor was the design unsuccessful : for he, ever 
eager after female beauty, deeply smitten with the gracefUi-

ness of her form and the elegance of her motion, instantlj 
conceiyed a vehement desire for the possession of her person, 
and immediatelj proposed marriage to her father ; urging 
him to a measure to which he was already well inclined. 
Hengist, at first, kept up the artifice bj a refusal ; stating, 
that so humble a connection was unworthy of a king : but, 
at last, appearing to consent with reluctance, he gave way to 
his importunities, and accepted, as a reward, the whole of 
Kent, where aU justice had long since declined under the 
administration of its Gourong (or Viceroy), who, like the 
other princes of the island, was subject to the monarchy of 
Yortigern. Not satisfied with this liberality, but abusing 
the imprudence of the king, the barbarian persuaded him to 
send for his son and brother, men of warlike talents, from 
Germany, pretending, that he would defend the province on 
the east, while they might curb the Scots on the northern 
frontier. The king assenting, they sailed round Britain, and 
arriving at the Orkney Isles, the inhabitants of which they 
involved in the same calamity with the Picts and Scots, at 
this and after times, they finally settled in the northern part 
of the island, now called Northumbria. Still no one there 
assumed the royal title or insignia till the time of Ida, from 
whom sprang the regal line of the Northumbrians ; but of 
this hereafter. We will now return to the present subject 

Yortimer, the son of Yortigern, thinking it unnecessary 
longer to dissemble that he saw himself and his Britons cir- 
cumvented by the craft of the Angles, turned his thoughts 
to their expulsion, and stimulated his father to the same 
attempt At his suggestion, the truce was broken seven 
years after their arrival ; and during the ensuing twenty, 
they frequently fought partial battles,* and, as the chronicle 
relates, four general actions. From the first conflict they 
parted on equal terms : one party lamenting the loss of 
Horsa, the brother of Hengist ; the other, that of Katigis, 
another of Yortigem's sons. The Angles, having the ad- 
vantage in all the succeeding encounters, peace was con- 
cluded ; Yortimer, who had been the instigator of the war,

and differed far fiom the indolenoe of Ins &ther, perished 
prematureljy or he would have governed the kingdom in a 
nohle manner, had God permitted. When he died, the 
British strength decayed, and all hope fled firom them ; and 
they would soon have perished altogether, had not Ambro- 
aius, the sole survivor of the Bomans, who became monarch 
after Yortigem, quelled the presumptuous barbarians by the 
powerful aid of warlike Artiiur. It is of this Arthur that 
tiie Britons fondly tell so many fables, even to the present 
day ; a man worthy to be celebrated, not by idle fictions, but 
by anthentic history. He long upheld the sinking state, and 
roused the broken spirit of his countrymen to war. Finally, 
at the siege of Mount Badon,* relying on an image of 'the 
Virgin, which he had affixed to his armour, he engaged nine 
hundred of the enemy, single-handed, and dispersed them 
with incredible slaughter. On the other side, the Angles, 
after various revolutions of fortune, filled up their thinned 
battalions with firesh supplies of their countrymen ; rushed 
with greater courage to the conflict, and extended themselves 
by d^rees, as the natives retreated, over the whole island : 
for the counsels of God, in whose hand is every change of 
empire, did not oppose their career. But this was eflected 
in process of time ; for while Yortigem lived, no new at- 
tempt was made against them. About this time, Hcngist, 
&om that bad quaHty of the human heart, which grasps after 
more in proportion to what it already possesses, by a pre- 
concerted piece of deception, invited his son-in-law, with 
three hundred of his followers, to an entertainment ; and 
when, by more than usual compotations, he had excited them 
to chunour, he began, purposely, to taimt them severally, with 
sarcastie raillery : this had the desired effect, of making them 
first quarrel, and then come to blows. Thus the Britons 
were basely murdered to a man, and breathed their last amid 
their cups. The king himself, made captive, purchased 
his liberty at the price of three provinces. After this, 
Hengist d^ed, in the thirty-ninth year after his arrival ; he

WB8 a man, who urging his sttcoess not less by artifice than 
oonri^ and giving firee scope to his natural ferodtj, pre- 
ferred effecting his purpose rather by cruelty tlum by 
kindness. He left a son named Eiisc;* who, more intent 
on defending, than enlarging, his dominions, never exceeded 
the paternal bounds. At the expiration of twenty«-four years, 
he had for his successors, his son Otha, and Otha's son, £r- 
menric, who, in their manners, resembled him, rather than 
their grandfather -and great grandfather. To the times of 
both, the Chronicles assign fifty-three years; but whether 
they reigned singly, or together, does not appear. 

After them Ethelbert, the son of Ermenio, reigned fifty- 
three years according to the Chronicle ; but fifty-six accord- 
ing to Bede. The reader must determine how this difi^rence 
is to be accounted for; as I think it sufficient to have apprized 
him of it, I shall let the matter restf In the infancy of his 
reign, he was such an object of contempt to the neighbouring 
kings, that, defeated in two battles, he could scarcely defend 
his frontier ; afterwards, however, when to his riper years he 
had added a more perfect knowledge of war, he quickly, by 
successive victories, subjugated every kingdom of the Angles, 
with the exception of the Northumbrians. And, in order to 
obtain foreign connections, he entered into affinity with the 
king of France, by marrying his daughter Bertha. And 
now by this connection with the Franks, the nation, hitherto 
savage and wedded to its own customs, began daily to divest 
itself of its rustic propensities and incline to gentler manners. 
To this was added the very exemplary life of bishop Luid- 
hard, who had come over with the queen, by which, though 
silently, he allured the king to the knowledge of Christ our 
Lord* Hence it arose, that his mind, already softened, easily 
yielded to the preaching of the blessed Augustine ; and he 
was the first of all his race who renounced the errors of 
paganism, that he might obscure, by the glory of his faitb, 

* According to Sprott, Hengist died in 488, and waa succeeded bj hit 
son Octa, rel Otca. Osca died 4.Di^08, and Esc, his son, ascended the 
thmne. In the year 622 Ermenric, Ae fiither of king Ethelbert, reigned. 
Ethelbert became king of Kent in 558. 

f The difference seems to have arisen from carelessnese in the scribe; as 
the Saxon Chronicle states him to have ascended the throne a.d. 560, and 
to have died 616: which is exactly fifty-six years, although it asserts him to 
hare reignad only 5S.

Doinlitj ; thia» exalted viriiie ; to exeel in worth those whom 
foa exceed in nmk. Bedded, extending his care to poe- 
teritj, he enacted Liws, in hia native tongue, in which he 
appointed rewards for the meritorious, and opposed severer 
restraints to the abandoned, leaving nothing doubtful for the 
fntoie.* 

Ethelbert died in the twenty-first year after he had em- 
braced the Christian faith, leaving the diadem to his son 
Edbald. As soob as he was freed from the restraints of 
ptttemal awe, he r^ected Christianity, and overcame the 
virtue of his stepmother.f But the severity of the divine 
mercy opposed a barrier to his utter destruction: for the 
princes, whom his father had subjugated, immediately re- 
belled, he lost a part of his dominions, and was perpetually 
haunted by an evil spirit, whereby he paid the penalty of 
his unbelief. Laurentius, the successor of Augustine, was 
offended at these transactions, and after having sent away 
his companions, was meditating his own departure from the 
country, but having received chastisement from God, he was 
induced to change his resolution.^ The king conversing with 
1dm on the subject, and finding his assertions confirmed by 
his stripes, became easily converted, accepted the grace of 
Christianity, and broke off his incestuous intercourse. But, 
that posterity might be impressed with the singular punish- 
ment due to apostacy, it was with difficulty he could main- 
tain his hereditary dominions, much less rival the eminoace 
of his father. For the remainder of his lifie, his faith was 
sound, and he did nothing to sully his reputation. The 
monastery also, which his father had founded without the 
waUa of Canterbury, § he ennobled with large estates, and 
sumptuous presents. The praises and merits of both these 
men Ofught ever to be proclaimed, and had in honour by the 
English ; because they allowed the Christian faith to acquire

Strength, in England, hy patioit listening and willingness to 
believe. Who can contemplate, without satisfaction, the jnst 
and amiable answer which Bede makes king £thelbert 1o 
haVe given to the first preaching of Augustine ? *' That he 
could not, thus early, embrace a new doctrine and leave the 
accustomed worship of his country ; but that, nevertheless, 
persons who had undertaken so long a journey for the pur- 
pose of kindly communicating to the Angles what they 
deemed an inestimable benefit, far from meeting with ill- 
treatment, ought rather to be allowed full liberty to preach, 
and also to receive the amplest maintenance." He fully kept 
his promise ; and at length the truth of Christianity beoom* 
ing apparent by degrees, himself and all his subjects were 
admitted into the number of the faithfuL And what did the 
other ? Though led away at first, more by the lusts of the 
fiesh than perverseness of heart, yet he pud respect to the 
virtuous conduct of the prelates, although he n^lected their 
faith; and lastly, as I have related, was easily converted 
through the sufferings of Laurentius, and became of infinite 
service to the propagation of Christianity. Both, then, were 
laudable : both deserved high encomiums ; for the good woik, 
80 nobly begun by the one, was as kindly fost^ed by the 
other. 

To him, af^er a reign of twenty-four years, succeeded 
Erconbert, his son, by Emma, daughter of the king of 
France. He reigned an equal number of years with his 
father, but under happier auspices; alike remarkable for 
piety towards Grod, and love to his country. For his grand- 
father, and father, indeed, adopted our faith, but neglected to 
destroy their idols; whilst he, thinking it derogatory to his 
royal zeal not to take the readiest mode of annihilating openly 
what they only secretly condenmed, levelled every temple of 
their gods to the ground, that not a trace of their paganism 
might be handed down to posterity. This was nobly done: 
for the mass of the people would be reminded of their super- 
stition, so long as they could see the altars of their deities. 
In order, also, that he might teach his subjects, who were 
too much given to sensual indulgence, to accustom them- 
selves to temperance, he enjoined the solemn fast of Lent 
to be observed throughout his dominions. This was an 
extraordinary act for the king to attempt in those times:

bat he was a man whom no blandishments of luzorj oonld 
enerrate ; no anxiety for power seduce from the worship of 
God. Wherefore he was protected by the favour of the 
Afanighty; every thing, at home and abroad, succeeded to 
his wishes, and he grew old in uninterrupted tranquillity. 
B5b daughter Eroongotha, a child worthy of such a parent, 
tnd emulating her father in virtuous qualities, became a 
flhining light in the monastery of Kalas in GauL* 

His son £gbert, retaining his father's throne for nine 
years, did nothing memorable in so short a reign; unless 
indeed it be ascril^ to the glory of this period, that Theo- 
dore'l' the archbishop, and Adrian the abbat, two consimunate 
scholars, came into England in his reign. Were not the sub- 
ject alrcaidy trite, I should willingly record what light they 
Bhed upon the Britons ; how on one side the Greeks, and on 
the other the Latins, emulously contributed their knowledge 
to the public stock, and made this island, once the nurse of 
tyrants, the constant residence of philosophy : but this and 
every other merit of the times of Egbert is clouded by his 
horrid crime, of either destroying, or permitting to be de- 
stroyed, Mbert and Egelbright, his nephews.]: 

To Egbert succeeded his brother Lothere, who began his 
rdgn with unpropitious omens. For he was harassed during 
eleven years by Edric, the son of Egbert, and engaged in 
many dvil conflicts which terminated with various success, 
until he was ultimately pierced through the body with a dart, 
and died while they were applying remedies to the wound. 
Sotoe say, that hoih the brothers perished by a premature 
death as a just return for their cruelty ; because Egbert, as 
I have related, murdered the innocent children of his uncle ; 
and Lothere ridiculed the notion of holding them up as 
martyrs : although the former had lamented the action, and 
had granted a part of the Isle of Thanet to the mother of 
his nephews, for the purpose of building a monastery.

Nor did Edrio long boast the profiperous stale of his 
goyemment ; for withm two jears he was despoiled both of 
kingdom and of lifb, and left his country to be torn in pieces 
hj its enemies. Immediately Csdwalla, with his brother 
Mull, in other respects a good and able man, but breathing 
an inextinguishable hatred against the people of Kent, made 
vigorous attempts upon the provinoe ; supposing it must 
easily surrender to lus yiews, as it had lately been in the 
eiyoyment of long continued peace, but at that time was torn 
with intestine war. He found, however, the inhabitants by 
no means unpr^mred or void of courage, as be had expected 
For, after many losses sustained in the towns and villages, at 
length they rushed with spirit to the conflict They gained 
the victory in the contest, and having put CsadwaDa to flighty 
drove his brother Mull into a litde cottage, which they set 
on Are. Thus, wanting courage to sally out against the 
enemy, the Are gained uncontrolled power, and he perished 
in the flames. Nevertheless Oedwalla ceased not his efforts^ 
nor retired from the province ; but consoled himself for his 
losses by repeatedly ravaging the district ; however, he left 
the avenging of this injury to Ina, his successor^ as will be 
related in its place. 

In this desperate state of the afiairs of Kent^ there was a 
void of about six years in the royal succession. In the 
seventh, Withred, the son of Egbert, having repressed the 
malevolence of his coimtrymen by his activity, and purchased 
peace from his enemies by money, was chosen king by the 
inhabitants, who entertained great and well-founded hopes of 
him. He was an admirable ruler at home, invincible in 
war, and a truly pious follower of the Christian faith, for he 
extended its power to the utmost. And, to complete his felicity, 
after a reign of thirty-three years, he died in extreme old age, 
which men generally reckon to be their greatest happiness, 
leaving his three children his heirs. These were J^bert, 
Ethelbert, and Alric, and they reigned twenty-three, eleven, 
and thirty-four years successively, without deviation from 
the excellent example and institutions of their father, except 
that Ethelbert, by the casual burning of Canterbuiy, and 
Alric, by an unsuccessful battle with the Mercians, consider- 
ably obscured the glory of their reigns. So it is that, if any 
thing disgraceful occurs, it is not concealed ; if any thing

fortunate, it is not Bafficiently noticed in the ChronieleB ; 
whether it be done designedly, or wliether it arise from thai 
bad quality of the hmnan mind, which makes gratitude for 
good transient ; whereas the recollection of evil remains for 
ever. After these men the noble stock of kings b^an to 
wither, the royal blood to flow cold. Then eyery daring 
adyentorer, who bad acquired riches by his eloquence, or 
whom faction had made formidable, aspired to the kingdom, 
and di^raoed the ensigns of ro^ty. Of these, ^bert 
otherwise called Fren, after having governed Kent two years. 
OTer-rating his power, was taken prisoner in a war with the 
Mercians, and loaded with chains. But being set at liberty 
hj his enemies, though not received by his own subjects, it 
18 oooertain by what end he perished. Cnthred, heir to the 
same fiustion and calamity, reigned, in name only, eight years. 
Next Baldred, a mere abortion of a king, after having for 
eighteen years more properly possessed, than governed the 
kingdom, went into ^dle, on his defeat by Egbert, king of 
the West Saxons. Thus the kingdom of Kent^ which, from 
the year of our Lord 449, had continued 375 years, became 
annexed to another. And since by following the royal line 
of the first kingdom which arose among the Angles, I have 
elicited a spark, as it were, from the embers of antiquity, I 
shall now endeavour to throw light on the kingdom <^ the 
West Saxons, which, though after a considerable lapse of 
time, was the next- that sprang up. While others were 
neglected and wasted away, tUs flourished with uncon- 
querable vigour, even to the coming of the Normans ; and, if 
I may be permitted the expression, with greedy jaws 
swaOowed up the rest Wherefore, aft«r tradng this

increiifled to great importance. He was a Grerman Yiy nation, 
of the noblest race, being the tenth from Woden, and, having 
nurtured his ambition in domestic broils, determined to leave 
his native land and extend his fame by the sword. Having 
formed this daring resolution he communicated his design to 
Genric his son, who closely followed his father's track to 
glory, and with his concurrence transported his forces into 
Britain in five ceols. This took place in the year of our 
Saviour^s incarnation 495, and the eighth after the death of 
Hengist. Coming into action with the Britons the very day 
of his arrival, this experienced soldier soon defeated an 
tmdisciplined multitude, and compelled them to fiy. By this 
success he obtained perfect security in future for himself, as 
well as peace for the inhabitants of those parts. For they 
never duned after that day to attack him, but voluntarily 
submitted to his dominion. Nevertheless he did not waste 
his time in indolence ; but, on the contrary, extending his 
conquests on all sides, by the time he had been twenty-four 
years in the island, he had obtained the supremacy <^ the 
western part of it, called West-Saxony. He died after enjoy- 
ing it sixteen years, and his whole kingdom, with the exception 
of the isle of Wight, descended to his son. This, by the 
royal munificence, became subject to his nephew, Withgar ; 
who was as dear to his unde by the ties of kindred, for he 
was his sister^s son, as by his skill in war, and formed a 
noble principality in the island, where he was afterwards 
splendidly interred. Cenric moreover, who was as illustrious 
as his father, after twenty-six years, bequeathed the kingdom, 
somewhat enlarged, to his son Ceawlin. 

The Chronicles extol the singular valour of this man in 
battle, so as to excite a d^ree of envious admiration ; for he 
was the astonishment of the Angles, the detestation of the 
Britons, and was eventually the destruction of both. I shall 
briefiy subjoin some extracts from them. Attacking Ethel- 
bert king of Kent, who was a man in other respects laudable, 
but at that time was endeavouring ftt)m the consciousness of 
his family's dignity to gain the ascendency, and, on this 
account, making too eager incursions on the territories of his 
neighbour, he routed his troops and forced him to retreat. 
The Britons, who, in the times of his father and grandfather, 
had escaped destruction either by a show of submission, or

bj the str^ngA of tiidr fortifications at Gloucester^ Ciren- 
cester, and Bath, he now pursued with ceaseless rancour ; 
ejected them from their cities, and chased them into 
moimtainous and woody districts, as at the present day. 
But about this time, as some unlucklj throw of the dice in 
the table of human life perpetuallj disappoints mankind, his 
military successes were clouded by domestic calamity : his 
brother Cutha met an untimely death, and he had a son 
of the same name taken off in battle ; both young men of 
great expectation, whose loss he frequently lamented as a 
seTere blow to his happiness. Finally, in his latter days, 
himself, banished from his kingdom, presented a spectacle, 
pitiable even to his enemies. For he had sounded, as it 
^vere, the trumpet of his own detestation on all sides, and 
the Angles as well as the Britons conspiring against him, his 
forces were destroyed at Wodensdike ; * he lost his kingdom 
thirty-one years after he had gained it; went into exile, 
and shortly after died. The floating reins of government 
were then directed by his nephews, the sons of Cutha, that 
u to say, Celiic during six, Ceolwulf during fourteen years : 
of these the inferior with respect to age, but the more 
exceUent in spirit, passed all his days in war, nor ever 
neglected, for a moment, the protection and extension of his 
empire. 

After him, the sons of Celric^ Cynegils and Cuichelm, 
jointly put on the ensigns of royalty ; both active, both 
contending with each other only in mutual offices of kind- 
neas; ins(Hnuch, that to their contemporaries they were a 
miracle of concord very unusual amongst princes, and to 
posterity a proper example. It is difficult to say whether 
their courage or their moderation exceeded in the numberless 
contests in which they engaged either against the Britons, or 
against Penda, king of the Mercians : a man, as will be 
rdated in its place, wonderfully expert in tiie subtleties of 
var ; and who^ overpassing the limits of his own territory, 
in an attempt to add Cirencester to his possessions, beis^ 
viable to withstand the power of these united kings, escaped 
with only a few followers. A considerable degree of guilt 
indeed attaches to Cuichelm, for attempting to take off, by the 
hands of an assassin, Edwin king of the Northumbrians, a

Who asks if fraud or force availed the foe ? * 

be considered^ he will be readilj excused, as having done 
nothing uncommon, in wishing to get rid, bj whatever means, 
of a rival encroaching on his power. For he had formerly 
lopped off much from the West Saxon empire, and now 
receiving fresh ground of offence, and his ancient enmi^ 
reviving, he inflicted heavy calamities on that people. The 
kings, however, escaped, and were, not long after, enlightened 
with the heavenly doctrine, by the means of St. Birinus the 
biflhoR in the twenty-fifth ye" of their reign, and the 
fortieth after tiie coming of the blessed Augustine, the 
apostle of the Angles. Cynegils, veiling his princely pride, 
condescended to receive immediately the holy rite of baptism : 
Cuichelm resisted for a time, but warned, by the sicknoss of 
his body, not to endanger the salvation of his soul, he became 
a sharer in his brother's piety, and died the same year. 
Cynegils departed six years afterwards, in the thirty-first 
year of his reign, enjoying the happiness of a long-extended 
peace. 

Kenwalk his son succeeded : in the beginning of his reign, 
to be compared only to the worst of princes ; but, in the 
succeeding and latter periods, a rival of the best. The 
moment the young man became possessed of power, wantoning 
in r^al luxury and disregarding the acts of his father, he 
algured Christianity and legitimate marriage ; but being 
attacked and defeated by Fenda, king of Merda, whose 
sister he had repudiated, he fled to the king of the £a8t 
Angles. Here, by a sense of his own calamities and by the 
perseverance of his host, he was once more brought back to 
the Christian faith ; and after three years, recovering his 
strength and resuming his kingdom, he exhibited to his 
subjects the joyful miracle of his reformation. So valiant 
was he, that, he who formerly was unable to defend his own 
territories, now extended his dominion on every side; 
totally defeating in two actions the Britons, furioos 
with the recollection of their ancient liberty, and in conse- 
quence perpetually meditating resistance ; first, at a place 
called Witgeomesburg,f and then at a mountain named

Pene;* and again, ayenging the iignty of hifl fiiiher on 
Wolfhere, the son of Penda» he deprived him of the greatest 
part of hia kingdom : moreover he was so reUgions, that^ 
first of an his race, he built, for those times, a most b^utiful 
diaieh at Winchester, on whkh site afterwards was founded 
the episcopal see with still more skilful magnificence. 

BiBt since we have arrived at the times of Eenwalk, and 
the proper place occurs f<^ mentioning the monastery of 
Gteonburj,f I shall trace from its very origin the rise and 
progress of that church as far as I am able to discover it 
from the mass of evidences. It is related in annals of good 
credit that Lucius, king of the Britons, sent to Pope Elen- 
tiierin^ thirteenth in succession from St. Peter, to entreaty 
that ha would dispel the darkness of Britain by the splendour 
of Goistian instruction. This surely was the commendable 
deed of a magnanimous prince, eagerly to seek that faith, the 
meatisB of which had barely reached him, at a time when it 
was an object of persecution to almost every king and people 
to whom it was oflfered. In consequence, preachers, sent by 
Eleatherius, came into Britain, the effects of whose labours 
win remain for ever, although the rust of antiquity may have 
obliterated their names. By these was built the ancient 
church of Si Mary of Glastonbury, as faithful tradition has 
haaded down through decaying time. Moreover there are 
documents of no small credit, which have been discovered in 
certain places to the following effect : *^ No other hands than 
those of the disetpks of Christ erected the church of 
dastonbury." Nor is it dissonant from probability : for if 
PhiHp^ the Apostle, preached to the Gauls, as Freculphus 
males in the fourth chapter of his second book, it may be 
Relieved that he also planted the word on this side of the 
channel also. But that I may not seem to balk the 
expectation of my readers by vain imaginations, leaving all 
douMhl matter, I shall proceed to the relation d substantial 
tmths.

22 WILLIAM OF ICALMESBXTBT. [b-lcIL 

The church of which we are speaking, from its antiqiuly 
called hj the Angles, hy way of distinction, " Ealde Chirche,'* 
that is, the ** Old Church,** of wattle-work, at firsts savoured 
somewhat of heavenly sanctify even from its very foundation, 
and exhaled it over the whole country ; claiming superior 
reverence, though the structure was mean. Hence, here 
arrived whole tribes of the lower orders, thronging every 
path ; here assembled the opulent divested of their pomp ; 
and it became the crowded residence of the religious add 
the literary. For, as we have heard from men of old time, 
here Grildas, an historian neither unlearned nor inelegant^ to 
whom the Britons are indebted for whatever notice they 
obtain among other nations, captivated by the sanctity of the 
place^ took up his abode for a series of years.* This ehurch, 
then, is certainly the oldest I am acquainted with in 
England, and from this drcumstance derives its name. In 
it are preserved the mortal remains <)f many saints, some of 
whom we shall notice in our progress, nor is any comer of 
the church destitute of the ashes of the holy. The very 
floor, inlaid with polished stone, and the sides of the altar, 
and even the altar itself above and beneath are laden with 
the multitude of relics. Moreover in the pavement may be 
remarked on every side stones designedly interlaid in 
triangles and squares, and figured with lead, under which if 
I believe some sacred enigma to be contained, I do no 
injustice to religion. The antiquity, and multitude of its 
saints, have endued the place witii so much sanctity, that» at 
nighty scarcely any one presumes to keep vigil there, or, 
during the day, to spit upon its floor : he who is conscious of 
pollution shudders throughout his whole frame : no one ever 
brought hawk or horses within the confines of the neigh- 
bouring cemetery, who did not depart injured either in them 
or in himself. Within the memory of man, all persons who, 
before undergoing the ordeal f of fire or water, there put up 

* There is a Life of Gfldas, written not lon^ after this history, by Caiadoc 
of Lancarron, in which we are told, that, while he was residing at Glaston- 
bury, a prince of that oonntiy carried oiF Arthui's queen and lodged her 
there ; that Arthur immediately besieged it, but, through the mediation of 
the abbat, and of Gildas, consented, at length, to receive his wife again and 
to depart peaceably. 

f The ordeal was an appeal to heayen to decide immediately on the 
justice of the cause. There were many modes of this whimsical trial ; as 



A.s.«7e.] FBTAMID8 NKAB GLASTOlfBUBT. 23 

thdr ]>etiti<Mi% exulted in their escape, one only excepted : if 
anj person erected a building in its vicinity, which by its 
shade obstructed the light of the church, it forthwith became 
a ruin. And it is sufficiently evident, thal^ the men of that 
proyince had no oath more frequent^ or more sacred, than to 
swear by the Old Church, fearing the swiftest vengeance on 
their perjury in this respect The truth of what I have 
asserted, if it be dubious, will be supported by testimony in 
the book which I have written, on the antiquity of the s^d 
church, according to the series of years. 

In tiie meantime it is clear, that the depository .of so 
many saints may be^eservedly styled an heavenly sanctuary 
upon earth. There are numbers of documents, though I 
abstain &om mentioning them for fear of causing weariness, 
to prove how extremely venerable this place was held by the 
chief persons of the country, who there more especially chose 
to await the day of resurrection under the protection of the 
inother of Grod. Willingly would I declare the meaning of 
those pyramids, which are almost incomprehensible to all, 
could I but ascertain the truth. These, situated some few 
feet firom the church, border on the cemetery of the monks. 
That which is the loftiest and nearest the church, is twenty- 
eight feet high and has five stories : this, though threatening 
niin from its extreme age, possesses nevertheless some traces 
of autiquify, which may be clearly read though not perfectly 
^derstood. In the highest story is an image in a pontifical 
l^t In the next a statue of regal dignity, and the letters, 
Her Sexi, and Blisperh. In the third, too, are the names, 
I^encrest, Bantomp, Finepegn. In the fourth, Bate, Pulfred, 
and Eanfled. In the fifth, which is the lowest, there is an 
unage, and the words as follow, Logor, Peslicas, and Br^- 
^eD, Spelpes, Highingendes Beam. The other pyramid is 
twenty-six feet l^h and has four stories, in which are read, 
Keutwin, Hedda the bishop, and Bregored and Beorward. 
The meaning of these I do not hastily decide, but I shrewdly 
conjecture tihat within, in stone coffins, are contained the 

by handling hot iron, plungmg the arm into hot water, throwing the accused 
into water, &c. If, after three dajrs, the party exhibited no mark of 
jl^nuog In the two former ; or if he did not sink in the latter experiment,

bones of those persons whose names are inscribed withoat.* 
At least Logor is said to imply the person firom whom Log- 
peresbeorh formerly took its name, which is now called Mon- 
tacate; Bregden, from whom is derived Brentknolle and 
Brentmarsh; Bregored and Beorward were abbats c£ that 
place in the time of the Britons ; of whom, and of others 
which occur, I shall henceforward speak more drcmnstan- 
tially. For my history win now pnx^ed to disclose the suc- 
cession of abbats, and what was bestowed on each, or on the 
monastery, and by what particular king. 

And firsts I shall briefly mention St Patrick, from whom 
the series of our records dawns. Wh^e the Saxons were 
disturbing the peace of the Britons, and the Pelagians as- 
saulting their faitii, St. Ge]:manus of Auxerre assisted them 
against both ; routhig the one by the chorus of HaUelujah,f 
and hurling down the other by the thunder of tilie Evan- 
gelists and Apostles. Thence returning to his own country, 
he summoned Patrick to become his inmate, and after a few 
years, sent him, at the instance of Pope Celestine, to preach 
to the Irish. Whence it is written in the Chronicles^ ** In 
the year of our Lord's incarnation 425, St Patrick is or- 
dained to Ireland by Pope Celestine." Also, ''In the year 
433 Ireland is converted to the faith of Christ by the pr^ich- 
ing of St Patrick, accompanied by many miracles." In con- 
sequence executing his appointed office with diligence, and in 
his latter days returning to his own country, he landed in 
Cornwall, from his altar,f which even to this time is held in 
high veneration by the inhabitants for its sanctity and effi- 
cacy in restoring the infirm. Proceeding to Olastonboiy, 
and there becoming monk, and abbat, after some years he 
paid the debt of nature. All doubt of the truth of this

t St. Germanus drew up a body of his new converts in a vallej sommnded 
on erery nde by mountaina, and, on the approach of Uieir ooemiei^ oidefed 
that on a given ngnal» all should shout '^ Halleluiah." The sudden sound, 
being rererberated by the surrounding mountains, struck their ibes with 
such a panic, that they instantly fled. See Bede, Hist. Eccl. b. i. c 20. 

X Patrick is said to have floated over, fW>m Ireland, on this altar, and to 
have landed near Padstow in Cornwall. Cough's Camden, i. 19. Malmea- 
bury appears to have been misled by the Glastonbury historian, so as to con* 
found St. Patrick with St Petrock. From the latter, the town of Padstow de- 
rives its name, as is proved by Whltaker, in his Ancient Cathedral of ComwalL

asaertaon is removed by the vision of a certain brother, who^ 
alter the saint's death, when it had frequently become a 
question, through decay of evidence, whether he really was 
mook and abbat there, had the fact confirmed by the follow- 
ing orade. When asleep he seemed to hear some person 
reading after many of his miracles, the words which follow 
— ''this man then was adorned by the sanctity of the metro- 
politan pall, but afterwards was here made monk and abbat" 
He added, moreover, as the brother did not give implicit 
credit to 1dm, that he could show what he had said inscribed 
in golden letters. Patrick died in the year of his age 111, 
of our Lord's incarnation 472, being the forty-seventh year 
after he was sent into Ireland. He lies on the right side of 
the altar in the old church : indeed the care of posterity has 
eoshiined his body in silver. Hence the Irish have an an- 
cient usage of frequenting the place to kiss the relics of their 
patron. Wherefore the re}>ort is extremely prevalent that 
both St Indract and St. Briget, no mean inhabitants of 
Ireland, formerly came over to this spot Whether Briget 
returned home or died at Glastonbury is not sufficiently 
ascertained, though she left here some of her ornaments; 
that is to say, her necklace, scrip, and implements for em- 
broidering, which are yet shown in memory of her sanctity, 
and are dficadous in curing divers diseases. In the course 
of my narrative it will appear that St Indract, with seven 
companions, was martyred near Glastonbury, and afterwards 
interred in the old church.* 

Benignus succeeded Patrick in the government of the 
>bbey ; but for how long, remains in doubt. Who he was, 
and how called in the vernacular tongue, the verses of his 
epiti^h at Ferramere express, not inapdy : 

Beneath this marble Beon's ashes lie^ 
Ozioe rev'kend abbat of this monastery :

gular grace of God which he andently possessed, and which 
he stiU retains. 

The esteem in which David, archbishop of Menevia, held 
this place, is too notorious to require repeating. He esta- 
blished the antiquity and sanctitj of the church hy a divine 
oracle ; for purposing to dedicate it, he came to the spot witli 
his seven su£Eragan bishops, and every thing being prepared 
for the due celebration of the solemnity, on the nighty as he 
purposed, preceding it, he gave way to profound repose. 
When all lus senses were steeped in rest, he beheld the Lord 
Jesus standing near, and mildly inquiring the cause of his 
arrival ; and on his inunediately disclosing it, the Lord di- 
verted him from his purpose by saying, " That the church 
had been already dedicated by himsdf in honour of his Mo- 
ther, and that the ceremony was not to be profaned by hu- 
man repetition." With these words he seemed to bore the 
palm of his hand with his finger, adding, ^' That this was a 
sign for him not to reiterate what himself had done before. 
But that, since his design savoured more of piety than of 
temerity, his punishment should not be prolonged: and 
lastly, that on the following morning, when he should repeat 
the words of the mass, ' With him, and by him, and in him,' 
his health should return to him undiminished." The prelate, 
awakened by thede terrific appearances, as at the moment be 
grew pale at the purulent matter, so afterwards he hailed the 
truth of the prediction. But that he might not appear to 
have done nothing, he quickly built and dedicated another 
church. Of this celebrated and incomparable man, I am at 
a loss to decide, whether he closed his life in this place, or at 
his own cathedral For they affirm that he is with St. Pa- 
trick ; and the Welsh, both by the frequency of their prayers 
to him and by various reports, without doubt confirm and 
establish this opinion ; openly alleging that bishop Bernard 
sought after him more than once, notwithstanding much 
opposition, but was not able to find him. But let thus much 
suffice of St David. 

After a long lapse of time, St Augustine, at the instance 
of St Gregory, came into Britain in the year of our Lord's 
incarnation 696, and the tradition of our ancestors haa 
handed down, that the companion of his labours, Paulinus, 
who was bishop of Rochester after being archbishop of 



•«*».n5-6B.i GBAsrrs to olajbtonbubt. 97 

York, covered the chuieh, built, as we have before obeerred, 
of watde-work, -with a caaiiig of boards. The derteritj 
of tiiis celebrated man so artfollj managed, that nothing of 
its flonctitj should be lost, though much should accrue to its 
l»eauty : and certainly the more magnificent the ornaments of 
churches are, the more the j incline the brute mind to prayer, 
and bend the stubborn to supplication. 

In tiie year of our Lord's incarnation 601, that is, the fi^ 
after the arriyal of St. Augustine, the king of Devonshire, on 
the petition of abbat Worgrez, granted to the old church 
iHiicfa is there situated the knd caQed Ineswitrin, containing 
five cassates.* ^'I, Mawom, bishop, wrote this grant. I, 
Worgrez, abbat of the same place, signed it" 

Who this king might be, the antiquity of the instrument 
prevents our knowing. But that he was a Briton cannot be 
doubted, because he called GListonbury, Ineswitrin, in his 
vernacular tongue ; and that, in the British, it is so called, is 
well known. Moreover it is proper to remark the extreme 
antiquity of a church, which, even then, was called ^ the old 
church.'' In addition to Worgrez, Lademund and Bregored, 
whoee very names imply British barbarism, were abbats of 
Hob place. The periods of their presiding are uncertain, but 
their names and dignities are indicated by a painting in the 
larger church, near the altar. Blessed, therefore, are the 
inhabitants of this place, allured to uprightness of life, by 
reverence for such a sanctuary. I cannot suppose that any 
of these, when dead, can fail of heaven, when assisted by 
the virtues and intercession of so many patrons. In the 
year of our Lord's incarnation 670,' and the 29th of his 
rdgn, Kenwalk gave to Berthwald, abbat of Glastonbury, 
Femunere, two hides, at the request of archbishop Theo- 
dore. The same Berthwald, against the will of the king 
and of the bishop of the diocese, relinquishing Glastonbury, 
went to govern the monastery of Reculver. Li consequence, 
Berthwald equally renowned for piety and high birth, being 
n^hew to Ethehned, king of the Mercians, and residing in 
the vicinity of Canterbury, on the demise of archbishop 
Theodore, succeeded to his see. This may be sufficient for 
me to have inserted on the antiquity of the church of Glas-

tonlmiT. Now I shall retam in course to Kenwalk, wlio 
was of a character so munificent that he never refused to 
give any part of his patrimony to his rehttions; but with 
noble-minded generosity conferred nearly the third of his 
kingdom on his nephew.* These qualities of the royal 
mind, were stimulated by the admonitions of those holy 
bishops of his proYince, A gilbert, of whom Bede relates 
many commendable things in his bistory of the Angles, and 
his nephew Leutherius, who, after him, was> for seven years, 
bish<^ of the West Saxons. This circumstance I have 
thought proper to mention, because Bede has left no aoooont 
of the duration of his episcopacy, and to disguise a hict 
which I leam inm the Chrexiioles, would be against my 
conscience; besides, it affords an importunity for making 
mention of a distinguished man, who by a mind, dear, and 
almost divinely inspired, advanced the monastery of Mahnea- 
bury, where I carry on my earthly warfare^ to the highest 
pitch. This monastery was so slenderly endowed by Mail- 
dulph, a Scot, as they say, by nation, a philosopher by em- 
dition, and a monk by profession, that its members coold 
scarcely procure their daily subsistence; but Leutherios, 
after long and due deliberation, gave it to Aldhelm,! a monk 
of the same place, to be by him governed with the authority 
tiien possessed by bishops. Of which matter, that my rela- 
tion may obviate every doubt, I shall subjmn his own words. 
** 1, Leutherius, by divine permission, bishop supreme of 
the Saxon see, am requested by the abbats who, within the 
jurisdiction of our diocese^ preside over the conventual aa- 
semblies of monks with pastoral anxiety, to give and to 
grant that portion of land called MaiHulfesburgh, to Aid- 
helm the priest^ for the purpose of leading a life according 
to strict rule ; in which place, indeed, from his earliest in- 
fancy and first initialion in the study <^ learning, he has 
been instructed in the liberal arts, and passed his days, nur- 
tured in the bosom of the holy mother diurch ; and on which 
accoimt fraternal love appears principally to have conceived 
this request. Wherefore assenting to the petition of tiie 
aforesaid abbats, I willingly grant that place to him and his 
successors^ who shall sedulously follow the laws of the holy

But when the industry ci the abbat was superadded to 
the kjndneas of the bishop, then the affiurs of the monastery 
hegui to flourish exceedingly ; then monks assembled on aH 
sides; there was a general concourse to Aldhelm ; some ad- 
miring the sanctity of his life, others the depth of his learn- 
ing. For he was a man as unsophisticated in religion as 
multifarious in knowledge ; whose piety surpassed eyen his 
lepotatian ; and he had so fully imbibed the liberal arts, that 
he was wonderful in each of them, and unrivalled in all. I 
great^ err, if his works written on the subject of virginity,f 
than which, in my opinion, nothing can be more pleasing or 
more splendid, are not proofs of his immortal genius : al- 
thd^hy such is the slothfulness of our times, they may 
excite disgust in some persons, not duly considering how 
modes of expression di£5er according to the customs of 
nations. The Greeks, for instance, express themselves im- 
l^iedly, the Bomans clearly, the Grauls gorgeously, the 
Angles turgidly. And truly, as it is pleasant to dwell on 
the graces of our ancestors and to animate our minds by 
their example, I would here, most willingly, unfold what 
painful labours this holy man encountered for the privileges 
of our church, and with what miracles he signalized his life, 
did not my avocations lead me elsewhere ; and his noble acts 
^pear clearer even to the eye of the purblind, than they 
can possibly be sketched by my pencil. The innumerable 
miwJ»lA« which now take* place at his tomb, manifest to the 
joesent race the sanctity of the life he passed. He has 
therefore his proper praise; he has the fkme acquired by 
his merits.} We proceed with the history.

After thirfy-one years, Kenwalk dying, bequeathed the 
administration of the government to his wife Sc^burga ; nor 
did this woman want spirit for discharging the duties of the 
station. She levied new forces, preserved the old in their 
duty ; ruled her subjects with moderation, and overawed her 
enemies : in short, she conducted all things in such a manner, 
that no difference was discernible except that of her sex. 
But, breathing more than female spirit, she died, having 
scarcely reigned a year. 

Escwin passed the next two years in the government; a 
near relation to the royal family, being grand-nephew to 
Cynegils, by his brother Cuthgist. At his death, either 
natural or violent, for I cannot exactly find which, Kentwin, 
the son of Cynegils, filled the vacant throne in legitimate 
succession. Both were men of noted experience in war ; as 
the one routed the Mercians, the other the Britons, with 
dreadful slaughter: but they were to be pitied for the short- 
ness of their career ; the reign of the latter not extending 
beyond nine, that of the former, more than two years, as I 
have already related. This is on the credit of the ChronideB. 
However, Bede records that they did not reign successively, 
but divided the kingdom between them. 

Next sprang forth a noble branch of the royal stock, Casd- 
walla, grand-nephew of Ceawlin, by his brother Gutha : a 
youth of unbounded promise, who allowed no opportunity of 
exercising his valour to escape him. He, having long sinoe^ 
by his active exertions, excited the animosity of the princes 
of his country, was, by a conspiracy, driven into exile. 
Yielding to this outrage, as the means of depriving the 
province of its warlike force, he led away all the m&tary 
population with him ; for, whether out of pity to his broken 
fortunes, or regard for his valour, the whole of the youth 
accompanied him into exile. Ethelwalch, king of the South 
Saxons, hazarding an engagement with him, felt the first 
effects of his fury : for he was routed with all the forces he had 
collected, and too late repented his rash design.* The spirits 
of his followers being tjius elated, CsBdwalla, by a sudden 
and unexpected return, drove the rivals of his power fitun

lite kingdoDL Enjojing Lis govemment for the space of 
two years, he performed manj signal exploits. His hatred 
and hoetOity toiwards the South Saxons were inextinguish- 
able, and he totally destroyed Edric, the successor of Ethel- 
walch, who opposed him with renovated boldness : he nearly 
depopulated the Isle. of Wight^ which had rebelled in con- 
federacy with the Mercians : he also gained repeated victories 
over the people of Kent, as I have mentioned before in their 
history. Finally, as is observed above, he retired from that 
province, on the death of his brother, compensating his loss 
by the blood of many of its inhabitants. It is difficult to 
relate, how extremely pious he was evei^ before his baptism, 
insQipuch that he dedicated to God the tenth of all the spoils 
whic^ he had acquired in war. In which, though we ap- 
prove the intention, we condemn the example ; according to 
the saying : ^ He who offers sacrifice from the substance of 
a poor man, is Uke him who immolates the son in the sight 
of the father." That he went to Rome to be baptized by 
Pope Seigius, and was called Peter; and that he yielded 
joyfully to the will of heaven, while yet in his initiatory 
robes, are matters too well known to require our illustration. 
After his departure to Rome, the government was assumed 
by Ina, grand-nephew of Cynegils by his brother Cuthbald, 
who ascended the throne, more from the innate activity of 
his spirit, than any legitimate right of succession. He was 
a rare example of fortitude ; a mirror of prudence ; un- 
equalled in piety. Thus regulating his life, he gained favour 
at home and respect abroad. Safe from any apprehensions 
of treachery, he grew old in the discharge of his duties for 
fifty-eight years, the pious conciliator of general esteem. 
His first expedition was against the people of Kent, as the 
indignation at their burning Moll hsA not yet subsided. 
The inhabitants resisted awhile : but soon finding all their 
attempts and endeavours fail, and seeing nothing in the dis- 
position of Ina which could lead them to suppose he would 
remit his exertions, they were induced, by the contemplation 
of their losses, to treat of a surrender. They tempt the 
royal mind with presents, lure him with promises, and 
bu^in for a peace for thirty thousand marks of gold, that, 
sofloied by so high a price, he should put an end to the 
war, and, boimd in golden chains^ sound a retreat. Accept-

ing the money, as a snfficient atonement for their offence^ he 
returned into hifl kingdom. And not only the people of 
Kent, bat the East Aisles* also felt the effects of his here- 
ditary anger; all their nolnlity being first expelled, and 
afterwards routed in battle. But let the relation of his mili- 
tary successes here find a termination. Moreover how sedu- 
lous he was in religious matters, the laws he enacted to re- 
form the manners of the people, are proof sufficient ;t in 
which the image of his purity is reflected even upon the 
present times. Another proof are the monasteries nobly 
founded at the king's expense. Butf more especially Glaa- 
tonbury, whither he ordered the bodies of the blessed martyr, 
Indract, and of his associates, to be takei firom the place of 
their martyrdom and to be conveyed into the church. The 
body of St. Indract he deposited in* the stone pyramid on 
the left side of the altar, where the zeal of posterity after- 
wards also placed St. Hilda : the others were distributed 
beneath the pavement as chance directed or regard might 
suggest Here, too, he erected a church, dedicated to the 
holy apostles, as an appendage to the ancient church, of which 
we are speaking, enriched it with vast possessions, and 
granted it a privil^e to the following effect : 

'^ In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ : I, Ina, sup- 
ported in my royal dignity by Grod, with the advice of my 
queen, Sexburga, and the permission of Berthwald, archbishop 
of Canterbury, and of all his sufiragans ; and also at tiie in- 
stance of the princes Baltred and Athelard, to the ancient 
church, situate in the place called Glastonbury (which church 
the great high-priest and chiefest minister formerly through 
his own ministry, and that of angels, sanctified by many and 
unheard-of miracles to himself and the eternal Virgin Mary, 
as was formerly revealed to St David,) do grant out of those

Lontokay : Baltred, who gave Pennard, six hides : Athelard 
who contributed Poelt, sixty hides'; I, Ina, permitting and

people I assent, and I guard by the security of my royal grant 
against the designs of malignant men and snarling curs, in 
order that the church of our Lord Jesus Christ and the eternal 
Virgin Mary, as it is the first in the kingdom of Britain and 
the source and the fountain of all religion, may obtain sur- 
passing dignity and privilege, and, as she rules over choirs of 
angels in heaven, it may never pay servile obedience to men 
on earth. Wherefore the chief pontifi*, Gregory, assenting, 
and taking the mother of his Lord, and me, however un- 
worthy, together with her, into the bosom and protection of

and establish, that, all lands, places, and possessions of St

royal taxes and works, which are wont to be appointed, that 
is to say, expeditions, the building of bridges or forts, and 
from the edicts or molestations of all archbishops or bishops,

posal and limits of churches, the ordination of clerks, eccle- 
siastical synods, and all judicial inquiries, they shall be deter- 
mined by the decision of the abbat and convent, without the 
interference of any person whatsoever. Moreover, I command 
aU princes, archbishops, bishops, dukes, and governors of my 
kingdom, as they tender my honour and regard, and all de- 
pendants, mine as well as theirs, as they value their personal 
safety, never to dare enter the island of our Loi^ Jesus 
Christ and of the eternal Virgin, at Glastonbury, nor the 
possessions of the said church, for the purpose of holding 
courts, making inquiry, or seizing, or doing anything what- 
ever to the offence of the servants of God there residing : 
moreover I particularly inhibit, by the curse of Almighty 
God, of the eternal Virgin Mary, and of the holy apostles 
Peter and Paul, and of the rest of the saints, any bishop on 
any account whatever from presuming to take his episcopal 
seat or celebrate divine service or consecrate altars, or dedi- 
cate churches, or ordain, or do any thing whatever, either in 
the church of Glastonbury itself, or its dependent churches, 
that is to say — Sowy, Brente, Merlinch, Sapewic, Stret 
Sbudeclalech, Pilton, or in their chapels, or islands, unless he 
be specially invited by the abbat or brethren of that place. 
But if he come upon such invitation, he shall take nothing 
to himself of the things of the church, nor of the offerings ; 
knowing that he has two mansions appointed him in two 
several places out of this church's possessions, one in Pilton, 
the other in the village called Poelt, that, when coming or 
going, he may have a place of entertainment. Nor even 
shall it be lawful for him to pass the night here unless he 
shall be detained by stress of weather or bodily sickness^ or 
invited by the abbat or monks, and then with not more than 
three or four clerks. Moreover let the aforesaid bishop be 
mindful every year, with his clerks that are at Wells, to 
acknowledge his mother church of Glastonbury with litanies 
on the second day after our Lord's ascension ; and should he 
haughtily defer it, or fail in the things which are above re- 
cited and confirmed, he shall forfeit his mansions above men- 
tioned. The abbat or monks shall direct whom they please, 
celebrating Easter canonicaUy, to perform service in the 
church of Glastonbury, its dependent churches, and in their 
chapels. Whosoever, be he of what dignity, profession, or

degree, he maj, shall hereafter, on any occasion whatsoever, 
tttempt to penrert, or nalUfj this, the witness of my munifi- 
ceaoe and liberality, let him be aware that^ with the traitor 
Jadas, he shall perish, to his eternal confusion, in the de- 
Touring flames of unspeakable torments. The charter of 
this donation was written in the year of our Lord's incarna- 
tion 725, the foorteenth of the indiction, in the presence of 
the king Ina, and of Berthwald, archbishop of Canterbury." 
What splendour he [Ina] added to the monastery, may be 
collected from the short treatise which I have written about 
its antiquities.* Father Aldhelm assisted the design, and 
his precepts were heard with humility, nobly adopted, and 
joyfully carried into effect. Lastly, the king readily con- 
finned the privilege which Aldhelm had obtained from pope 
Sergios, for the immunity of his monasteries ; gave much to 
the servants of Grod by his advice, and finally honoured him, 
though constantly refusing, with a bishopric ; but an early 
death malignantly cut off this great man from the world. 
For scarcely had he discharged the offices of his bishopric 
four years, ere he made his soul an offering to heaven, in 
the year of our Lord's incarnation 709, on the vigil of St. 
Augustine the apostle of the Angles, namely the eighth be- 
fore the Kalends of June.f Some say, that he was the 
nephew ci the king, by his brother Kenten ; but I do not 
choose to assert for truth any thing which savours more of 
▼ague opinion, than of historic credibility ; especially as I 
can find no ancient record of it, and the Chronicle clearly de- 
clares, that Lia had no other brother than Ingild, who died 
same few years before him. . Aldhelm needs no support from 
fiction : suchi great things are there concerning him of indis- 
putable truth, so many which are beyond the reach of doubt. 
The sisters, indeed, of Lia were Cuthburga and Cwenburga. 
Cuthbnrga was given in marriage to Alfrid, king of the 
Northumbrians, but the contract being soon after dissolved, 
she led a life dedicated to God, first at Barking,} under the 
abbess Hildelitha, and afterwards as superior of the convent 
at Wimbome ; now a mean village, but formerly celebrated

for contauung a full company of virgins, dead to euthly 
desires, and breathing only aspirations towards heaven. 
She embraced the profession of holy celibacy from the peru- 
sal of Aldhelm's books on virginity, dedicated indeed to the 
sisterhood of Barking, but profitable to all, who aspire to 
that state. Ina's queen was Ethelburga, a woman of royal 
race and disposition : who perpetually urging the necessity 
of bidding adieu to earthly things, at least in the close of 
life, and the king as constantly deferring the execution of 
her advice, at last endeavoured to overcome him by strata- 
gem. For, on a certain occasion, when they had been 
revelling at a country seat with more than usual riot and 
luxury, the next day, after their departure, an attendant, 
with die privity of the queen, defiled the palace in every 
possible manner, both with the excrement of cattle and heaps 
of filth ; and lastly he put a sow, which had recently far- 
rowed, in the very bed where they had lain. They had 
hardly proceeded a mile, ere she attacked her husband witii 
the fondest conjugal endearments, entreating that they might 
immediately return thither, whence they had departed, say- 
ing, that his denial would be attended with dangerous con- 
sequences. Her petition being readily granted, the king was 
astonished at seeing a place, which yesterday might have 
vied with Assyrian luxury, now filthily disgusting and deso- 
late : and silently pondering on the sight, his eyes at length 
turned upon the queen. Seizing the opportunity, and plea- 
santly smiling, she said, " My noble spouse, where are the 
reveUings of yesterday ? Where the tapestries dipped in 
Sidonian dyes ? Where the ceaseless impertinence of para- 
sites ? Where the sculptured vessels, overwhelming the very 
tables with their weight of gold ? Where are the delicacies 
so anxiously sought throughout sea and land, to pamper the 
appetite ? Are not all these things smoke and vapour ? 
Have they not all passed away ? Woe be to those who attach 
themselves to such, for they in like manner shall consume 
away. Are not aU these like a rapid river hastening to the 
sea ? And woe to those who are attached to them, for thev 
shall be carried away by the current. Reflect, I entreat you, 
how wretchedly will these bodies decay, which we pamper 
with such unbounded luxury. Must not we, who gorge so 
constantly, become more disgustingly putrid ? The mighty

most imdei^ mighfier torments, and a seyerer trial awaits 
the strong.'* Without saying more, bj this striking example, 
she gained over her husband to those sentiments, which she 
had in Tain attempted for years bj persuasion.* 

For after bis triumphal spoils in war ; after many succes- 
siTe d^ees in virtue, he aspired to the highest perfection, 
and went to Borne. There, not to make the glory of his 
cooyeraion public, but that he might be acceptable in the 
sight of Grod alone, he was shorn in secret ; and, clad in 
homely garb, grew old in priyacy. Nor did his queen, the 
author of this noble deed, desert him ; but as she had before 
incited him to imdertake it, so, afterwards, she made it her 
constant care to soothe his sorrows by her conyersation, to 
.stimulate him, when wayering, by her example ; in short, to 
omit nothing that could be conduciye to his salyation. Thus 
united in mutual affection, in due time they trod the common 
path of all mankind. This was attended, as we have heard, 
with singular miracles, such as God often deigns to bestow 
on ihe.yirtues of happy couples. 

To the goyemment succeeded Ethelard, the cousin of Ina ; 
though Oswald, a youth of royal extraction, often obscured 
his opening prospects. Exciting his countrymen to rebellion, 
he attempted to make war on the king, but soon after perish- 
ing by some unhappy doom, Ethelard kept quiet possession 
of the kingdom for fourteen years, and then left it to his 
kinsman, Cuthred, who for an equal space of time, and with 
similar courage, was ever actiyely employed : — 

** In the name of our Lord Jesus Chnst, I, Cuthred, king 
of the West Saxons^ do hereby declare that all the gifts of 
fonner kings — ^Eentwin, Baldred, KedwaU, Ina, Ethelard, 
and Ethbald king of the Mercians, in country houses, and in 
tillages and lands, and farms, and mansions, according to the 
confirmations made to the ancient city of Glastonbury, and 
confirmed by autograph and by the sign of the cross, I do, as 
was before said, hereby decree that this grant of former kings 
shall remain firm and inyiolate, as long as the reyolution of 
the pole shall carry the lands and seas with r^ular moye-

ment round the stany heavens. But if any one, confiding 
in tjrannical pride shall endeavour on any occasion to dis- 
turb and nullify this my testamentary grant, may he be sepa- 
rated by the fan of the last judgment from the congregation 
of the righteous, and joined to the assembly of the wicked 
for ever, paying the penalty of his violence. But whoever 
with benevolent intention shall strive to approve, confirm, 
and defend this my grant, may he be allowed to enjoy un- 
failing immortality before the glory of Him that sitteth on 
the throne, together with the happy companies of angels and of 
all the saints. A copy of this grant was set forth in presence 
of king Cuthred, in the aforesaid monastery, and dedicated 
to the holy altar by the munificence of his own hand, in the 
wooden church, where the brethren placed the coffin of abbat 
Hemgils, the 30th of April, in the year of our Lord 745.*' 

The same Cuthred, after much toil, made a successful cam- 
paign against Ethelbald, king of Mercia, and the Britons, 
and gave up the sovereignty after he had held it fourteen 
years. 

Sigebert then seized on the kingdom ; a man d inhuman 
cruelty among his own subjects, and noted for cowardice 
abroad ; but the common detestation of all conspiring against 
him, he was within a year driven from the throne, and gave 
place to one more worthy. Yet, as commonly happens in 
similar cases, the severity of his misfortunes brought back 
some persons to his cause, and the province which is called 
Hampshire, was, by their exertions, retained in subjection to 
him. . Still, however, unable to quit his former habits, and 
exciting the enmity of all against him by the murder of one 
Cumbran, who had adhered to him with unshaken fidelity, 
he fied to the recesses of wild beasts. Misfortune still 
attending him thither also, he was stabbed by a swineherd. 
Thus the cruelty of a king, which had almost desolated the 
higher ranks, was put an end to by a man of the lowest 
condition. 

Cynewolf next undertook the guidance of the state ; illus- 
trious for the regulation of his conduct and his deeds in arms : 
but suffering extremely from the loss of a single battle, in the 
the twenty-fourth year of his reign, against Offa, king of the 
Mercians, near Bensington, he was also finally doomed to a 
di/^graceful death. For after he had reigned thirty-one

jearsy* ndther indolentlj nor oppressiyelj, either elated with 
saocess, because he imagined nothing could oppose him, or 
alarmed for his posterity, from the increasing power of 
Eineard, the brother of Sigebert, he compelled him to quit 
the kingdom. Elneard, deeming it necessary to yield to the 
onergency of the times, departed as if voluntarily ; but soon 
after, when by secret meetings he had assembled a desperate 
band of wretches, watching when the king might be alone, 
for he had gone into the country for the sake of recreation, 
he followed him thither with his party. And learning that 
he was there giving loose to improper desires, he beset the 
honse on all sides. The king struck with his perilous situa- 
tion, and holding a conference with the persons present, shut 
fast the doors, expecting either to appease the desperadoes 
by fair language, or to terrify them by threats. When 
neither succeeded, he rushed furiously on Eineard, find had 
nearly killed him ; but, surrounded by the multitude, and 
thinking it derogatory to his courage to give way, he fell, 
selling his life nobly. Some few of his attendants, who, in- 
stead of yielding, attempted to take vengeance for the loss of 
their lord, were slain. The report of this dreadful outrage 
soon reached the ears of the nobles, who were waiting near 
at hand. Of these Esric, the chief in age and prudence, 
conjuring the rest not to leave nnrevenged the death of their 
sovereign to their own signal and eternal ignominy, rushed 
with d^wn sword upon the conspirators. At first Kineard 
attempted to ai^e his case ; to make tempting offers ; to 
hold forth their relationship ; but when this availed nothing, 
he stimulated his party to resistance. Doubtful was the con- 
flict, where one side contended with all its powers for life, 
the other for glory. And victory, wavering for a long time, 
at last decided for the juster cause. Thus, fruitlessly valiant, 
this unhappy man lost his life, unable long to boast the suc- 
cess of his treachery. The king's body was buried at Win- 
chester, and the prince's at Repton ; at that time a noble 
monastery, but at present, as I have heard, with few, or 
scarcely any inmates. 

* Malmesbury' here perpetuates the error of the treiucriber of the Saxon 
Chronicle, in aangning thirty-one years to Cynewolf, for as he came to the 
throne in 756, and was killed in 784, consequently he reigned about 
twenty-nine yean. Perhaps he wrote, correctly, *< uno de triffinta annia"

friendship, affable with foreigners^ and giving great allow- 
ances to his subjectSy in thoee matters at least which could 
not impair the strength of the government. To acquire still 
greater estimation with his neighbours^ he married the 
daughter of Offa, king of Merda, at that time all-powerful ; 
bj whom, as far as I am acquainted, he had no issoe. 
Supported hy this alliance he compelled Egbert, the sole 
survivor of the royal stock, and whom he feared as the most 
effectual obstacle to his power, to fly into France. In fi^et 
Bertric himself and the other kings, after ina, though 
glorying in the splendour of their parentage, as deriving 
their origin from Cerdic> had considerably deviated from tke 
direct line of the royal race. On Egbert's expulsion, then, 
he had already begun to indulge in indolent security, when 
a piratical tribe of the Danes^ accustomed to live by plunder, 
clandestinely arriving in three ships, disturbed the tran* 
quillity of the kingdom. This band came ov^ expressly to 
ascertain the fruitfulness of the soil, and the courage of the 
inhabitants, as was afterwards discovered by the arrival of 
that multitude, which over-ran almost the whole of Britain. 
Landing then, unexpectedly, when the kingdom was in a 
state of profound peace, they seized upon a royal village, 
which was nearest them, and killed the superintendent, who 
had advanced with succours ; but losing their booty, through 
fear of the people, who hastened to attack them, they retired 
to their ships. After Bertric, who was buried at Warham, 
Egbert ascended the throne of his ancestors ; justly to be 
preferred to all the kings who preceded him. Thus having 
brought down our narrative to his times, we must, as we 
have promised, next give our attention to the Northumbrians.

Of the kinffs qf the Northumbriam. [a.d. 450.] 

We have before related briefly, and now necessarily repeal 
that Hengist, having settled lus own government in Kent, 
had sent his brother Otha, and his son Ebusa, men of 
activity and tried experience, to seize on the northern parts 
of Britain. Sedulous in executing the command, affiurs

sncoeeded to dieir wishes. For finequentiy coming into actioQ 
with the inhabitants^ and dispersing those who attempted 
reaistanoe, thej conciliated with uninterrapted quiet such as 
sabmitted. Thus, though through their own address and 
the good will of their followers, they had established a 
certain degree of power, jet never entertaining an idea of 
asamning the rojal title, thej left an example of similar 
moderation to their immediate posterity. For during the 
space of ninety-nine years, the Northumbrian leaders^ 
contented with subordinate power, lived in subjection to the 
kings of Kent. Afterwards, however, this forbearance 
ceased ; either because the human mind is ever prone to 
degeneracy, or because that race of people was naturally 
ambitious. In the year, therefore, of our Lord's incarnation 
547, the sixtieth alter Hengist's death, the principality was 
converted into a kingdom. The most noble Ida, in the full 
vigour of life and of strength, first reigned there. But 
whether he himself seized the chief authority, or received it 
by the consent of others, I by no means venture to determine, 
because the truth is unrev^ed. However, it is sufficiently 
evident, that, sprung from a great and ancient lineage, he 
reflected much splendour on his illustrious descent, by his 
pure and unsullied manners. Unconquerable abroad, at 
home he tempered his kingly power with peculiar affability. 
Of this man, and of others, in their respective places, I 
could lineally trace the descent, were it not that the very 
names, of uncouth sound, would be less agreeable to my 
readers than I wish. It may be proper though to remark, 
that Woden had three sons ; Weldeg, Withleg, and Beldeg ; 
from the first, the kings of Kent derived their origin ; from 
the second, the kings of Mercia ; and from the third, the 
kings of the West- Saxons and Northumbrians, with the 
exception of the two I am going to particularize. This Ida, 
then, the ninth from Beldeg, and the tenth from Woden, as 
I find positively declared, continued in the government 
fourteen years. 

His successor Alia, originating from the same stock, but 
descending from Woden by a different branch, conducted the 
government, extended by his exertions considerably beyond 
its former bounds, for thirty years. In his time, youths from 
Northumbria were exposed for sale, after the common and 



42 WILLIAK OF MALMESBUBT. [b. i. c 3. 

almost native custom of this people ; so that, even as our 
days have witnessed, thej would make no scruple of 
separating the nearest ties of relationship through the 
temptation of the slightest advantage. Some of these youths 
then, carried from England for sale to Rome, hecame the 
means of salvation to all their countrymen. For exciting 
the attention of that city, by the beauty of their countenances 
and the elegance of their features, it happened that, among 
others, the blessed Gregory, at that time archdeacon of the 
apostolical see, was present. Admiring such an assemblage 
of grace in mortals, and, at the same time, pitying their 
abject condition, as captives, he asked the standers-by, ''of 
what race are these ? Whence come they ? " They reply, " by 
birth they are Angles ; by country are Deiri ; (Deira being 
a province of Northumbria,) subjects of Eling Alia, and 
Pagans.** Their concluding characteristic he accompanied 
with heartfelt sighs : to the others he elegantiy alluded, 
saying, ''that these Angles, a^^^eZ-like, should be delivered 
from CdeJ iroy and taught to sing AUe-hda,^ Obtaining 
permission without delay from pope Benedict, the industry 
of this excellent man was all alive to enter on the journey to 
convert them ; and certainly his zeal would have completed 
this intended labour, had not the mutinous love of his 
fellow citizens recalled him, already on his progress. He 
was a man as celebrated for his virtues, as beloved by his 
countrymen ; for by his matchless worth, he had even 
exceeded the expectations they had formed of him from his 
youth. His good intention, though frustrated at this time, 
received afterwards, during his pontificate, an honourable 
termination, as the reader will find in its proper place. I 
have made this insertion with pleasure, that my readers 
might not lose this notice of Alia, mention of whom is 
slightly made in the life of Pope Gregory, who, although he 
was the primary cause of introducing Christianity among 
the Angles, yet, either by the counsel of God, or some 
mischance, was never himself permitted to know it The 
calling, indeed, descended to his son. 

On the death of Alia, Ethelric, the son of Ida, advanced 
to extreme old age, after a life consumed in penury, obtained 
the kingdom, and after five years, was taken off by a sudden 
death. He was a pitiable prince, whom fame would have 



48 

hidden in obscarity, had not the conspicuoas energy of the 
son lifted up the father to notice. 

When, therefore, by a long old age, he had satisfied the 
desire of life, Ethc^rid, the elder of his sons, ascended the 
throne, and compensated the greenness of his years by the 
matority of his conduct. His transactions have been so dis- 
played by graceful composition, that they want no assistance 
of mine^ except as order is concerned. Bede has eagerly 
dwelt on the praises of this man and his successors ; and has 
dilated on the Northumbrians at greater length, because they 
were his near neighbours : our history, therefore, will select 
and compile from his relation. In order, however, that no 
one may blame me for contracting so diffuse a narrative, I 
most t^ him that I have done it purposely, that they who 
have been satiated with such high-seasoned delicacies, may 
respire a little on these humble remnants : for it is a saying 
trite by use and venerable for its age, *^ that the meats which 
doy the least are eaten with keenest appetite." Ethelfrid 
then, as I was relating, having obtained the kingdom, began 
at first vigorously to defend his own territories, afterwards 
eagerly to invade his neighbours, and to seek occasion for 
signalizing himself on all sides. Many wars were begun by 
him with foresight, and terminated with success ; as he was 
ndther restrained from duty by indolence, nor precipitated 
into rashness by courage* An evidence of these things is 
Degstan,* a noted place in those parts, where Edan, king of 
the Scots, envying Ethelfrid's successes, had constrained 
him, though averse, to give battle ; but, being overcome, he 
took to fiight, though the triumph was not obtained without 
considerable hazard to the victor. For Tedbald, the brother 
of Ethelfrid, opposing himself to the most inmiinent dangers 
that he might <&splay his zeal in his brother's cause, left a 
mournful victory indeed, being cut off with his whole party. 
Another proof of his success is afforded by the city of Car- 
legion, now commonly called Chester, which, till that period 
possessed by the Britons, fostered the pride of a people hos- 
tile to the king. When he bent his exertions to subdue this 
city, the townsmen preferring any extremity to a siege, and 
at the same confiding in their numbers, rushed out in multi- 
tudes to battle. But deceived by a stratagem, they were

oreroome and put to flight ; his fury being first rented od 
the monks, who came out in numbers to praj for the safety 
ef the army. That their number was incredible to these 
times is apparent from so many half-destroyed walls of 
churches in the neighbouring monastery, so many winding 
porticoes, such masses of ruins as can scarcely be seen else- 
where. The place is called Bangor ; at that day a noted 
monastery, but now changed into a cathedral.* Ethelfrid, 
thus, while circumstances proceeded to his wishes almMid, 
being desirous of warding off domestic apprehensions and 
intestine danger, banished Edwin, the son of Alia, a youth 
of no mean worth, from his kingdom and country. He^ 
wandering for a long time without any settled habitation, 
found many of his former friends more inclined to his enemy 
than to the observance of their engagements ; for as it is 
said, 

'^ If joy be thine, 'tii then thj friends aboond : 
Mikbrtime eomes^ and thou alone art found." f 

At last he came to Bedwald, king of the East Angles, and 
bewailing his misfortunes, was received into his protection. 
Shortly after there came messengers firom Ethelfrid, either 
demanding the surrender of the fugitive, or denouncing hos- 
tilities. Determined by the advice of hiS wife not to violate, 
through intimidation, the laws of friendship, Bedwald col- 
lected a body of troops, rushed against Ethelfrid, and at- 
tacked him suddenly, wMlst suspecting nothing less than an 
assault. The only remedy that courage, thus taken by sur- 
prise, could suggest, there being no time to escape, he availed 
himself of. Wherefore, though almost totally unprepared, 
though beset with fearful danger on every side, he fell not 
till he had avenged his own death by the destruction of 
Begnhere, the son of Redwald. Such an end had EthelMd, 
after a reign of twenty-four years : a man second to none in 
martial experience, but entirely ignorant of the holy faith. 
He had two sons by Acca, the daughter of Alia, sister of 
Edwin, Oswald aged twelve, and Oswy four years ; who, 
upon the death of their father, fied through the management 
of their governors, and escaped into Scotland.

In tMs manner^ all his iiteIs beong filam or baniishedy 
Edwin, trained by many adTersitieB, ascended, nol meanly 
qualified, the sanunit of power. When the haughtiness of 
Uie Northumbrians had bent to his dominion, his felicity was 
crowned by the timely death of Bedwald, whose subjects, 
during Edwin's eadie among them, having formerly experi- 
enced his ready courage and ardent disposition, now willingly 
swore obedience to Um. Granting to the son of Bedwald 
the empty ^title <^ long, himself managed all things as he 
thought fit. At this junctture, the hopes and the resources 
of the Angles centred totally in him ; nor was there a single 
province of Britain whidi did not regard his will, and prepare 
to obey it, except Kent : for he had left the Kentish people 
free from his incursions, because he had long meditated 
a marriage with Ethelburga, sister of their king. When 
she was granted to him, after a courtship long protracted, to 
the intent that he should not despise that woman when pos- 
sessed whom he so ardently desired when withheld, these 
two kingdoms became so united by the ties of kindred, that, 
there was no rivaliy in their powers, no difference in their 
manners. Moreover, on this occasion, the faith of Christ 
our Lord, infused into those parts by the preaching of Fau- 
linus, reached first the king himself, whom the queen, among 
other proofs of conjugal affection, was perpetually instruc- 
ting ; nor was the admonition of bishop Paulinus wanting in 
its place. For a long time, he was wavering and doubtful ; 
but once received, he imbibed it altogether. Then he invited 
neighbouring kings to the faith ; then he erected churches, 
and neglected nothing for its propagation. In the mean- 
while, the merciful grace of God smiled on the devotion of 
the king; insomuch, that not only the nations of Britain, 
that is to say, the Angles, Scots, and Picts, but even the 
Orkney and Mevanian isles, which we now call Anglesey, 
that is, islands of the Angles, both feared his arms, and 
venerated his power. At that time, there was no public 
robber; no domestic thief; the tempter of conjugal fidelity 
was far distant ; the plunderer of another man's inheritance 
was in exile : a state of things redounding to his praise, and 
worthy of celebration in our times. In short, such was the 
increase of his power, that justice and peace willingly met 
and kissed each other, imparting mutual acts of kindness.

And DOW indeed' would the government of the Angles have 
held a prosperous course, had not fui untimelj death, the 
stepmother of all earthly felicity, hy a lamentable turn of 
fortune, snatched this man from his country. For in the 
forty-eighth year of his age, and the seventeenth of his 
reign, being killed, together with his son, by the princes 
whom he had formerly subjugated, Cadwalla of the Britons 
and Penda of the Mercians, rising up against him, he became 
a melancholy example of human vicissitude. He was inferior 
to none in prudence : for he would not embrace even the 
Christian faith till he had examined it most carefully; but 
when once adopted, he esteemed nothing worthy to be com- 
pared to it. 

Edwin thus slain, the sons of Ethelfrid, who were alao 
the nephews of Edwin, Oswald, and Oswy, now grown up, 
and in the budding prime of youth, re-sought their country, 
together with Eanfrid, their elder brother, whom I forgot 
b^ore to mention. The kingdom, therefore, was now divided 
into two. Indeed, Northumbria, long since separated into 
two provinces, had elected Alia, king of the Deirans, and 
Ida, of the Bemicians. Wherefore Osric, the cousin of Ed- 
win, succeeding to Deira, and Eanfrid, the son of Ethelfrid, 
to Bernicia, they exulted in the recovery of thdr hereditary 
right. They had both been baptized in Scotland, though 
they Were scarcely settled in their authority, ere they re- 
nounced their faith : but shortly after they suffered the just 
penalty of their apostacy through the hostility of Cadwalla. 
The space of a year, passed in these transactiops, improved 
Oswald, a young man of great hope, in the science of govern- 
ment. Anned rather by his faith, for he had been admitted 
to baptism while in exile with many nobles among the Scots, 
than by his military preparations, on the first onset he drove 
Cadwalla,* a man elated with the recollection of his former 
deeds, and, as he used himself to say, '* bom for the exter- 
mination of the Angles," from his camp, and afterwards de- 
stroyed him with all his forces. For when he had collected 
the little army which he was able to muster, he excited them 
to the conflict, in which, la3ring aside all thought of flight, 
they must determine either to conquer or die, by suggestiii^

''that it must be a circumstance highlj diBgraceful for the 
Angles to meet the Britons on sach unequal terms, as to 
fight against those persons for safety, whom they had been 
used Yolontarily to attack for glory only ; that therefore they 
sboold maintain their liberty with dauntless courage, and 
the most strenuous exertions; but, that of the impulse to 
flight no feeling whatever should be indulged." In conse- 
quence they met with such fury on both sides, that, it may 
be truly said, no 'day was ever more disastrous for the Bri- 
tons, or more joyful for the Angles : so completely was one 
party routed with all its forces, as never to have hope of 
leoovering again; so exceedingly powerful di3 the other 
become, through the effects of faith and the accompanying 
courage of the king. From this time, the worship of idols 
fell prostrate in the dust; and he governed the kingdom, 
extended beyond Edwin's boundaries, for eight years, peace- 
ably and without the loss of any of his people. Bede, in his 
History, sets forth the praises of this king in a high style of 
panegyric, of which I shall extract such portions as may be 
necessary, by way of conclusion. With what fervent faith 
his breast was inspired, may easily be learned from this cir- 
cumstance. K at any time Aidan the priest addressed his 
auditors on the subject of their duty, in the Scottish tongue, 
and no interpreter was present, the king himself would di- 
rectly, though habited in the royal robe, glittering with gold, 
or glowing with Tyrian purple, graciously assume that office, 
and explain the foreign idiom in his native language. It is 
well known too, that frequently at entertainments, when the 
guests had whetted their appetites and bent their inclinations 
on the feast^ he would forego his own gratification ;* procur- 
ing, by his abstinence, comfort for the poor. So that I think 
the truth of that heavenly sentence was fulfilled even on 
earth, where the celestial oracle hath said, "He that dis- 
persed abroad, he hath given to the poor, his righteousness 
remaineth for ever." And moreover, what the hearer must 
wonder at^ and cannot deny, that identical royal right hand, 

* When he was seated at table and jost about to commence dinner, the 
royal almoner informed the king that a great number of poor were aesem- 
bled in the street, asking relief; on which he immediately ordered the whole 
of the provisions to be distributed, and the silver dish also to be cui into 
pieoo^ and divided amongst them. See Bede, b. iii. c. 6.

the dispenaer of so many akms, remains to this day perfect^ 
with the arm, the skin aad nerves, though the remainder of 
the body, with the exception of the bones, mouldering into 
dust, has not escaped the common lot of mortality. It is 
true the corporeal remains of some of the saints are uncon- 
scious altogether of decay. Wherefore let others determine 
by what standard they will fix their judgment; I pronounce 
this still more gracious and divine on account of its singular 
manifestation ; because things ever so precicAis degenerate by 
frequency, and whatever is more unusual, is celebrated more 
generally. I should indeed be thought prolix were I to re- 
late how diligent he was to address his prayers on high, and 
to fill the heavens with vows. This virtue of Oswald is too 
well known to require the support of our narrative. For at 
what time would that man neglect his supplications, who, in 
the insurrection excited by Penda king of the Mercians^ his 
guards being put to flight and himse& actually carrying a 
forest of darts in his breast, could not be prevented 1)y the 
pain of his wounds or the approach of death, from praying 
for the souls of his faithful companions ? In such manner 
this personage, of surpassing celebrity in this world, and 
highly in favour with GU>d9 ending a valuable life, trans- 
mitted his memory to posterity by a frequency of miracles ; 
and indeed most deservedly. For it is not common, but 
even more rare than a white crow, for men to abound in 
riches, and not give indulgence to their vices.* 

When he was slain, his arms with the hands and his head 
were cut off by the insatiable rage of his conqueror, and 
fixed on a stake. The dead trunk indeed, as I have men- 
tioned, being laid to rest in the calm bosom of the earth, 
turned to its native dust ; but the arms and hands, through 
the power of God, remain, according to the testimony of an 
author of veracity, without corruption. These being placed 
by his brother Oswy in a shrine, at the city of Bebbanburg,t 
so the Angled call it, and shown for a miracle, bear testimony 
to the fact Whether they remain at that place at the pre- 
sent day, I venture not rashly to affirm, because I waver in 
my opinion. If other historians have precipitately recorded 
any matter, let them be accountable : I hold common report

aX a cheaper rate, and affinn notiung Init what is deserving 
of entire credit. The head was then bnried by his before- 
mentioned brother at Lindisfame ; but it is said now to be 
preserved at Durham in the arms of the blessed Cuthbert* 
When Ostritha, the wife of Ethehred, king of the Mercians, 
daughter of king Oswy, through regard to her uncle, was 
anxious to take the bones of the trunk to her monastery of 
Bardnej, which is in the country of the Mercians not far 
ircHn the city of Lincoln, the monks refused her request at 
first ; denying repose even to the bones of that man when 
dead whom they had hated whilst living, because he had ob- 
tained their country by right of arms. But at midnight 
being taught, by a miraculous light from heaven shining on 
the r^cs, to abate their haughty pride, they became con- 
verts to reason, and even entreated as a favour, what before 
they had rejected. Virtues from on high became resident 
in thid place: every sick person who implored this most 
excellent martyr's asmstance, immediatdy received it. The 
withering turf grew greener from his blood, and recovered a 
horse :| and some of it being himg up against a post, the 
devouring flames fled from it in ^eir turn. Some dust, 
moistened frt>m his relics, was equally efficacious in restoring 
a lunatic to his proper senses. The washings of the stake 
which had imbibed the blood fr^h streaming from his head, 
restored health to one despairing of recovery. For a long 
time this monastery, possessing so great a treasure, flourished 
in the sanctity of its members and the abundance of its 
friends, more especially after king Ethelred received the 
tonsure there, where also his tomb is seen even to the pre- 
sent day. After many years indeed, when the barbarians 
infested these parts, the bones of the most holy Oswald were 
remoTed to Gloucester. This place, at that period inhabited 
by monks, but at the present time by canons, contains but 
few inmates. Oswald, therefore, was the man who yielded 
the first fruits of hoHness to his nation ; since no Angle be-

fore him, to my knowledge, was celebrated for mirades. For 
after a life spent in sanctitj, in liberallj giving alms, in fre- 
quent watchings and prajer, and lastly, through zeal for the 
church of Grod, in waging war with an heathen, he poured 
out his spirit, according to his wishes, before he could behold, 
what was his greatest object of apprehension, the decline of 
Christianitj. Nor indeed shall he be denied the praise of 
the martyrs, who^ first aspiring after a holy life, and next 
opposing his body to a glorious death, certainly trod in their 
steps : in a manner he deserves higher conmiendation, since 
they barely consecrated themselves to God ; but Oswald not 
only himself but all the Northumbrians with him. 

On his removal from this world, Oswy his brother 
assumed the dominion over the Bemidans, as did Oswin, 
the son of Osric, whom I have before mentioned, over 
the Deirans. After meeting temperately at first on the 
subject of the division of the provinces, under a doubtful 
truce, they each retired peaceably to their territories ; bat 
not long after, by means of persons who delighted in sowing 
the sec^ of discord, the peace, of which they had so often 
made a mockery by ambiguous treaties, was finally broken, 
and vanished into air. Horrid crime ! that there should be 
men who could envy these kings their friendly intimacy, nor 
abstain from using their utmost efforts to precipitate them 
into battle. Here then fortune, who had before so frequently 
caressed Oswin with her blandishments, now wounded him 
with her scorpionnsting. For thinking it prudent to abstain 
from fighting, on account of the smallness of his force, he 
had secretly withdrawn to a country-seat, where he was 
immediately betrayed by his own people, and killed by Oswy. 
He was a man admirably calculated to gain the favour of his 
subjects by his pecuniary liberality; and, as they relate, 
demonstrated his care for his soul by his fervent devotion. 
Oswy, thus sovereign of the entire kingdom, did every thing 
to wipe out thb foul stain, and to increase his dignity, ex- 
tenuating the enormity of that atrocious deed by the recti- 
tude of his future conduct Indeed the first and highest 
point of his glory is, that he nobly avenged his brother and 
his uncle, and gave to perdition Penda l^ig of the Mercians, 
that destroyer of his neighbours, and fomenter of hostility. 
From this period he either governed the Mercians, as well as

almost an the Angles^ himself, or was supreme oyer those 
who did. Taming from this time altogether to offices of 
fietjj that he might he trulj grateful for the favours of God 
perpetoallj flowing down upon him, he proceeded to raise up 
and animate, with all his power, the infancy of the Christian 
fiuthy which of late was fainting through his brother's deatL 
This fiuth, brought shortly after to maturity by the learning 
of the Soots, but wavering in many ecclesiastical observances, 
was now settled on canonical foundations:* first by Agilbert 
and Wilfrid, and next by archbishop Theodore : for whose 
arrival in Britain, although Egbert, king of Kent, as far as 
hifl province is concerned, takes much from his glory, the 
chief thanks are due to Oswy.f Moreover he built numer- 
ous habitations for the servants of €rod, and so left not his 
country destitute of this advantage also. The principal of 
these monasteries, at that time for females, but now for 
males, was situate about thirty miles north of York, and was 
anciently called Streaneshalch, but latterly Whitby. Begun 
by EQlda, a woman of singular piety, it was augmented with 
large revenues by Elfled, daughter of this king, who suc- 
ceeded her in the government of it ; in which place also she 
buried her father with all due solemnity, after he had reigned 
twenty-eight years. This monastery, like all others of the 
same order, was destroyed in the times of the Danish inva- 
sion, which will be related hereafter, and bereaved of the 
bodies of many saints. For the bones of St Aidan the 
bishop, of Geolfnd the abbat, and of that truly holy virgin 
Hilda, together with those of many others, were, as I have 
related in the book which I lately published on the Antiquity 
of the Church of Glastonbury, at that time removed to Glas- 
tonbury ; and those of other saints to different places. Now 
the monast^, under another name, and somewhat restored 
as drcumstances permitted, hardly presents a vestige of its 
finmer opulence. 

To Oswy, who had two sons, the elder who was illegiti- 
mate being rejected, succeeded the younger, Egfnd, legiti-

-vyas certainly to be commended for two things which I have 
read in the history of the Angles, his allowing his wife to 
dedicate herself to God, and his promoting the blessed Cath- 
bert to a bishopric, whose tears at the same time burst out 
with pious assent* But my mind shudders at the bare re- 
collection of his outrage against the holy Wilfirid, when, 
loathing his virtues, he deprived the country of this shining 
character. Overbearing towards the suppliant, a malady 
incident to tyrants, he overwhelmed the Irish, a race of men 
harmless in genuine simplicity and guiltless of every dime, 
with incredible slaughter. On the other hand, inactive 
towards the rebellious, and not following up the triumphs of 
his father, he lost the dominion of the Mercians, and more- 
over, defeated in battle by Ethelred the son of Penda, their 
king, he lost his brother also. Perhaps these last dream- 
stances may be truly attributed to the unsteadiness of 
youth, but his conduct towards Wil&id, to the instigation of 
his wife,t and of the bishops ; more espedaUy as Bede, a 
man who knew not how to flatter, calls him, in his book of 
the Lives of his Abbats, the most pious man, the most be- 
loved by God. At length, in the fifteenth year of his reign, 
as he was leading an expedition against the Picts, and 
eagerly pursuing them as they purposely retired to some 
secluded mountains, he perished with almost all his forces ; 
the few who escaped by flight carried home news of the 
event ; and yet the divine Cuthbert, from his knowledge of 
future events, had both attempted to keep him back, when 
departing, and at the very moment of his death, enlightened 
by heavenly influence, declared, though at a Stance, that 
he was slain. 

While a more than common report every where noised the 
death of Egfrid, an intimation of it, ** borne on the wings of 
haste," reached the ears of his brother AlMd. Though the

thj of tibe government^ from his illegitimacy, as I have ob- 
serred, and had retired to Ireland, either through compulsion 
or indignation. In this place, safe from the persecution of 
his brother, he had, from his ample leisure, become deeply 
Tersed in literature, and had enriched his mind with every 
kiiid of learning. On which account the very persons who 
had formerly banished him, esteeming him the better quali- 
fied to manage the reins of government, now sent for him of 
their own accord. Fate rendered efficacious their entreaties ; 
neither did he disappoint their expectations. For during 
the space of nineteen years, he presided over the kingdom in 
the ntmoBt tranquillity and joy ; doing nothing that even 
greedy calumny itself could justly carp at, except the perse- 
cution of that great man Wilfrid. However he held not the 
same extent of territory as his father and brother, because 
the Ficts, proudly profiting by their recent victory, and 
attacking the Angles, who were become indolent through a 
lengthened peaoe^ had curtuled his boundaries on the north. 
He had for successor his son, Osred, a boy of eight years 
old ; who disgracing the throne for eleven years, and 
spending an ignominious life in the seduction of nuns, was 
tdtimatdly taken off by the hostility of his relations. Yet 
he poured out to them a draught from the same cup ; for 
Kenred aflter reigning two, and Osric eleven years, left only 
this to be recorded of them ; that they expiated by a violent 
death, the blood of their master, whom they supposed they 
bad rightfully slain. Osric indeed deserved a happier end, 
for, as a heathen* says, he was more dignified than other 
shades, because, while yet Uving he had adopted Ceolwulf, 
Kenred's brother, as his successor. Then Ceolwulf ascended 
the giddy height of empire, seventh in descent from Ida : a 
man competent in other respects, and withal possessed of a 
depth of literature, acquired by good abilities and indefati- 
gable attention. Bede vouches for the truth of my assertion, 
who, at the very juncture when Britain most abounded with 
scholars, offered his Histoiy of the Angles, for correction, to 
this prince more especially ; making choice of his authority, 
to confirm by his high station what had been well written ; 
and of his learning, to rectify by his talents what might be 
carelessly expressed.

64 WILLIAII OF ICALMBSBITinr. [b.lc.3l 

In the fourth year of his reign, Bede, the historian, afl«r 
having written many books for the holy church, entered the 
heavenly kingdom, for which he had so long languished, in 
the year of our Lord's incarnation 734 ; of his age the 
fifty-ninth. A man whom it is easier to admire than worthily 
to extol : who, though bom in a remote corner of the world, 
was able to dazzle the whole earth with the brilliancy of his 
learning. For even Britain, which by some is called another 
world, since, surrounded by the ocean, it was not thoroughly 
known by many geographers, possesses, in its remotest region, 
bordering on Scotland, the place of his birth and education. 
This region, formerly exhaling the grateful odour of 
monasteries, or glittering with a multitude of cities built by 
the Romans, now desolate through the ancient devastations 
of the Danes, or those more recent of the Normans,* presents 
but little to allure the mind. Here is the river Wear, of 
considerable breadth and rapid tide ; which running into the 
sea, receives the vessels, borne by gentle gales, on the calm 
bosom of its haven. Both its banks f have been made 
conspicuous by one Benedict, j: who there built churches and 
monasteries ; one dedicated to Peter, and the other to Paul, 
united in the bond of brotherly love and of monastic rule. 
The industry and forbearance of this man, any one will 
admire who reads the book which Bede composed concerning 
his life and those of the succeeding abbats : his industry, in 
bringing over a multitude of books, and being the first person 
who introduced in England constructors of stone edifices, as 
well as makers of glass windows ; in which pursuits he spent 
almost his whole life abroad : the love of his country and 
his taste for elegance beguiling his painful labours, in the

t This is not quite correct : Jarrow, one of Benedict's monasteries, is on 
the river Tvne. 

f Benedict sumamed Biscop, a noble Northumbrian, quitted the service 
of king Oswy, when he had attained his twenty-fifth year, and travelled to 
Rome five several times ; occupying himself while there, either in leanung 
the Roman ritual, or in collecting books, pictures, and ornaments of various 
descriptions for the monasteries he had founded at Wearmouth : he also 
brought over masons from France to build a church after the Roman 
manner ; as well aa'artificers in glass. See Bede's Lives of the Abbata of 
Wearmouth and Janrow.

eaniest desire of canvejiiig something to his coantrjmen oat 
of llie common way ; for very rarely before the time of 
Benedict were buildings of stone * seen in Britain, nor did 
the solar ray cast its light through the transparent glass. 
Again, his forbearance: for when in possession of the 
monastery of St Augustine at Canterbury, he cheerfully 
resigned it to Adrian, when he arrived, not as fearing the 
aeyerity of St. Theodore the archbishop, but bowing to his 
aulhority. And farther, while long absent abroad, he 
endured not only with temper, but^ I may say, with 
magnanimity, the substitution of another abbat, without his 
knowledge, by the monks of Wearmouth ; and on his return, 
admitted him to equal honour with himself, in rank and 
power. Moreover, when stricken so severely with the palsy 
that he could move none of his limbs, he appointed a third 
abbat, because the other, of whom we have spoken, was 
not less affected by the same disease. And when the 
disorder, increasing, was just about to seize his vitals, he 
bade adieu to his companion, who was brought into his 
presence, with an inclination of the head only ; nor was he 
better able to return the salutation, for he was hastening to 
a still nearer exit, and actually died before Benedict 

Ceolfirid succeeded, under whom the affairs of the 
monasteiy flourished beyond measure. When, through 
eztrane old age, life ceased to be desirable, he purposed 
going to Rome, that he might pour out^ as he hoped, his 
aged soul an offering to the apostles his masters. But failing 
of the object of his desires, he paid the debt of nature at the 
city of Langres. The relics of his bones were in after time 
conveyed to his monastery ; and at the period of the Danish 
devastation, with those of St Hilda, were taken to Glaston- 
bury.f The merits of these abbats, sufficiently eminent in

De Gestis Pontif. lib. iii. f. 148. Bede, whom he here follows, affoids no 
■Mistenoe as to the precise meaning : he merely states, that Benedict caused 
a efaufch to be erected after the Roman model. 

t The monks of Glastonbuiy used all poesible means to obtain relics of 
saints. See the curious account of a contention concerning the body of 
St Danatan, which those monks asserted they had stolen ftom Canterbury, 
after it had been burnt by the Danes, in the time of Ethelrcd, in Wharton!

themselves, their celebrated pupil, Bede, cnrvrns with 
superior splendour. It is written indeed, *' A wise son is the 
gloiy of his father : " for one of them made him a monk, the 
other educated him. And since Bede himself has given some 
slight notices of these facts, comprising his whole life in a 
kind of summary, it may be allowed to turn to his words, 
which the reader will recognize, lest any variation of the 
style should affect the relation. At the end then of ^e 
Ecclesiastical Histoiy of the English * this man, as praise- 
worthy in other respects as in this, that he withheld nothing 
from posterity, though it might be only a trifling knowledge 
of himself, says thus : 

" I, Bede, the servant of Christ, and priest of the monas- 
tery of the holy apostles Peter and Paul, which is at Wear- 
mouth, have, by Gknl's assistance, arranged these materiala 
. for the history of Britain. I was bom within the poeses- 
sions of this monastery, and at seven years of age, was com- 
mitted, by the care of my relations, to the most reverend 
abbat Benedict, to be educated, and, after, to Ceolfrid ; pass- 
ing the remainder of my life from that period in residence 
at the said monastery, I have given up my whole attention 
to the study of the Scriptures, and amid the observance of 
my regular discipline and my daily duty of singing in the 
church, have ever delighted to learn, to teach, or to writer 
In the nineteenth year of my life, I took deacon's, in the 
thirtieth, priest's orders ; both, at the instance of abbat 
Ceolfrid, by the ministry of the most reverend bishop John :f 
from which time of receiving the priesthood tiU the fifty- 
ninth year of my age,. I have been employed for the benefit 
of myself or of my friends, in making these extracts from 
the works of the venerable fathers, or in making additions, 
according to the form of their sense or interpretation." Then 
enumerating thirty-six volumes which he published in 
seventy-eight books, he proceeds, " And I pray most earnestly, 
O merciful Jesus, that thou wouldst grant me, to whom thou 
hast abeady given the knowledge of th3rself, finally to come 
to thee, the fountain of all wisdom, and to appear for ever 
in thy presence. Moreover I humbly entreat all persons^

shall reach, that they he mindful to intercede with the divine

that, in their several provinces^ they make me this grateful 
return ; that I^ who have diligently laboured to record, of 
every province, or of more exalted places, what appeared 
worthy of preservation or agreeable to the inhabitants, may 
receive, firom all, the benefit of their pious intercessions." 

Here my abilities &i], here my eloquence falls short : 
ignorant which to praise most, the number of his writings, 
or the gravity of his style. No doubt he had imbibed a 
large portion of heavenly wisdom, to be able to compose so 
many volumes within the limits of so short a life. Nay, 
they even report, that he went to Rome for the purpose 
either of personally asserting that his writings were oon- 
^stexxt with the doctrines of the church ; or of correcting 
them by apostolical authority, should they be found repug- 
nant thereto. That he went to Rome I do not however 
affirm for fact : but I have no doubt in declaring that he was 
invited thither, as the following epistle will certify ; as well 
as that the see of Rome so highly esteemed him as greatly to 
desire his presence. 

^ Serghts the bishop, servant of the servants of God, to 
Ceoifrid the holy abbot sendeth greeting : — 

** With what words, and in what manner, can we declare 
the kindness and unspeakable providence of our God, and 
return fit thanks for his boundless benefits, who leads us, 
when placed in darkness, and the shadow of death, to the 
light of knowledge T* And below, " Know, that we received 
the fkvoor of the offering which your devout piety hath sent 
by the present bearer, with the same joy and goodwill with 
which it was transmitted. We assent to the timely and be- 
coming prayers of your laudable anxiety with deepest regard, 
and entreat of your pious goodness, so acceptable to God, 
that, since there have occurred certain points of ecclesiastical 
discipline, not to be promulgated without farther examina- 
tion, which have made it necessary for us to confer with a 
person skilled in literature, as becomes an assistant of Grod's 
holy universal mother-church, you would not delay paying 
ready obedience to this, our admonition ; but would send 
without loss of time, to our lowly presence, at the church of

the chief apostles, my lords Peter and Paul, your Mends and 
protectors, that religious servant of Grod, Bede, the venerable 
priest of your monastery ; whom, God willing, you may expect 
to return in safety, when the necessary discussion of the above- 
mentioned points shall be, by God's assistance, solemnly 
completed : for whatever may be added to the church at 
large, by his assistance, will, we trust, be profitable to the 
things conmiitted to your immediate care." 

So extensive was his fame then, that even the majesty of 
Rome itself solicited his assistance in solving abstruse ques- 
tions, nor did Gallic conceit ever find in this Angle any 
thing justly to blame. All the western world yielded the 
palm to his faith and authority ; for indeed he was of ^und 
faith, and of artless, yet pleasing eloquence : in all elucida- 
tions of the holy scriptures, discussing those points from 
which the reader might imbibe the love of God, and of his 
neighbour, rather than those which might charm by their 
wit^ or polish a rugged style. Moreover the irrefragable 
truth of that sentence, which the majesty of divine wisdom 
proclaimed to the world forbids any one to doubt the sanctity 
of his life, " Wisdom will not enter the malevolent soul, nor 
dwell in the person of the sinful ;** which indeed is said not 
of earthly wisdom, which is infused promiscuously into the 
hearts of men, and in which, even the wicked, who continue 
their crimes until their last day, seem often to excel, accord- 
ing to the divine expression, *' The sons of this world are in 
their generation wiser than the children of light }" but it 
rather describes that wisdom which needs not the assistance 
of learning, and which dismisses from its cogitations those 
things which are void of understanding, that is to say, of the 
understanding of acting and speaking properly. Hence 
Seneca in his book, " De Causis,"* appositely relates that 
Oato, defining the duty of an orator, said, '^ An orator is a 
good man, skilled in speaking." This ecclesiastical orator, 
then, used to purify his knowledge, that so he might, as far as 
possible, unveil the meaning of mystic writings. How indeed 
could that man be enslaved to vice who gave his whole soul 
and spirit to elucidate the scriptures ? For, as he confesses 
in his third book on Samuel, if his expositions were produc- 
tive of no advantage to his readers, yet were they of con- 

• Seneca» CoDtroyen. lib. 1. 



A.V. 735.] DEATH OF BEDK. 59 



importance to himself, inasmuch as, while fully in- 
tent upon them, he escaped the vanitj and empty imagina- 
tions of the times. Purified from vice, therefore, he entered 
within the inner veU, divulging in pure diction the senti- 
ments of his mind. 

Bat the unspotted sanctity and holy purity of his heart 
were chiefly conspicuous on the approach of death. Although 
for seven weeks successively, from the indisposition of his 
stomach, he nauseated all food, and was troubled with such a 
difficulty of breathing that his disorder confined him to his 
bed, yet he by no means abandoned his literary avocations. 
Daring whole days he endeavoured to mitigate the pressure 
of bis disorder and to lose the recollection of^ it by constant 
lectures to his pupils, and by examining and solving abstruse 
qne8ti<»is^ in addition to his usual task of psalmody. More- 
over the gospel of St. John, which from its difficulty exer- 
cises the talents of its readers even to the present day, was 
translated by him into the English language, and accommo- 
dated to those who did not understand Latin. Occasionally, 
also, would he admonish his disciples, saying, ^' Learn, my 
children, while I am with you, for I know not how long I 
shall continue ; and although my Maker should very shortly 
take me hence, and my spirit should return to him that sent 
and granted it to come into this life, yet have I lived long, 
God hath rightly appointed my portion of days, I desire to 
be dissolved and to be with Christ." 

Often too when the balance was poised between hope and 
fear, he would remark ^' It is a fearful thing to fall into the 
hands of the living God.* I have not passed my life among 
yoa in such manner as to be ashamed to live, neither do I 
fear to die, because we have a kind Master ;** thus borrowing 
the expression of St. Ambrose when dying. Happy man ! 
who could speak with so quiet a coniscience as neither being 
ashamed to Hve, nor afraid to die ; on the one hand not fear- 
ing the judgment of men, on the other waiting with com- 
posure the hidden will of Grod. Of^n, when urged by ex- 
tremity of pain, he comforted himself with these remarks, 
^ The furnace tries the gold, and the fire of temptation the 
just man : the sufferings of this present time are not worthy 

* HebrevB x. 31. 



60. WILLIAK OF ICALMSaBUBT. Cb.i.c.3. 

to be compared to the future glory which shall be revealed in 
us."* Tears and a difficulty of breathing accompanied his 
words. At night, when there were none to be instructed or 
to note down his remarks, he passed the whole season in 
giving thanks and singing psabns, fulfilling the saying of 
that very wise man,f '^ that he was never less alone than when 
alone." If at any time a short and disturbed sle^ stole upon 
his eye-lids, he immediately shook it oft, and showed that his 
affections were always intent on God, by exclaiming " Lift 
me up, O Lord, that the proud calumniate me not Do with 
thy servant according to thy mercy." These and similar ex- 
pressions which his shattered memory suggested, flowed 
spontaneously from his lips whenever the pain of his agonis- 
ing disorder became mitigated. But on the Tuesday before 
our Lord's ascension his disease rapidly increased^ and there 
appeared a small swelling in his feet, the sure and certain 
indication of approaching death. Then the congregation 
being called togetiier, he was anointed and reoelTed die sacra- 
ment Kissing them all, and requesting from each that they 
would bear him in remembrance, he gave a small present^ 
which he had privately reserved, to some with whom he had 
been in closer bonds of friendship. On Ascension day, when 
his soul, tired of the frail occupation of the body, panted to 
be free, lying down on a hair-cloth near the oratory, where 
he used to pray, with sense unimpaired and joyful counte- 
nance, he invited the grace of the Holy Spirit, saying, *' 
King of glory, Lord of virtue, who ascendedst this day trium- 
phant into the heavens, leave us not destitute, but send upon 
us the promise of the Father, the Spirit of truth." This 
prayer ended, he breathed his last, and immediately the senses 
of all were pervaded by an odour such as neither cinnamon 
nor balm could give, but coming, as it were, from paradise, 
and fraught with all the joyous exhalations of spring. At 
that time he was buried in the same monastery, but at pre- 
sent, report asserts that he lies at Durham with St Cuthbert 
With this man was buried almost all knowledge of history 
down to our times, inasmuch as there has been no English-

man either emulous of his pursuits, or a follower of his 
graces, who could continue the thread of his discourse, now 
brc^en short. Some few indeed, '^whom the mild Jesus 
loved," though well skilled in literature, have jet observed an 
ungracious silence throughout their lives ; others, scarcely 
tasting of the stream, have fostered a criminal indolence. 
Thus to the slothful succeeded others more slothful stiU, 
and the warmth of sdence for a long time decreased throughout 
the island. The verses of his epitaph will afford sufficient 
specimen of this indolence ; they are indeed contemptible, 
and unworthy the tomb of so great a man : 

" Pieflbyter hie Beda, requieBcit came sepultus ; 
Dona, Christe, animam in coelis gaud^re per mram : 
Daque illi sophis debriari fonte, cui jam 
Stupiiayit ovana, intento semper amore."* 

Can this disgrace be extenuated by any excuse^ that there 
was not to be found even in that monastery, where during 
his lifetime the school of all learning had flourished, a single 
person who could write his epitaph, except in this mean and 
paltry style ? But enough of this : I wiU return to my 
subject. 

Ceolwulf thinking it beneath the dignity of a Christian 'to 
b^ immersed in earthly things, abdicated the throne after a 
reign of eight years, and assumed the monastic habit at Lin- 
dis&me, in which place how meritoriously he lived, is amply 
testified by his being honourably interred near St. Cuthbcrt, 
and by many miracles vouchsafed from on high. 

He had made provision against the state's being endan- 
gered, by placing his cousin, Eadbert, f on the throne, which 
he filled for twenty years with singular moderation and 
virtue. Eadbert had a brother of the same name, archbishop 
of York, who, by his own prudence and the power of the 
king, restored that see to its original state. For, as is well 
known to any one conversant in the history of the Angles, J

62 "WTLLIAK OF MALKBSBUBT. (b.i.c.SL 

PaulinuAy the first prelate of the church of York, had been 
forcibly driven awaj, and died at Rochester, where he left 
that honourable distinction of the pall which he had received 
from pope Honorius. After him, manjr prelates of this 
august city, satisfied with the name of a simple bishopric, 
aspired to nothing higher : but when Eadbert was seated on 
the throne, a man of loftier spirit, and one who thought, 
that, " as it is over-reaching to require what is not our due, 
so is it ignoble to neglect our right,** he reclaimed the pall 
by frequent appeals to the pope. This personage, if I may 
be allowed the expression, was the depository and receptacle 
of every liberal art ; and founded a most noble library at 
York. For this I cite Alcuin,* as competent witness ; who 
was sent from the kings of England to ihe emperor Charles 
the Great, to treat of peace, and being hospitably entertained 
by him, observes, in a letter to Eanbald, third in succession 
from Eadbert, " Praise and glory be to Grod, who hath pre- 
served my days in full prosperity, that I should rejoice in 
the exaltation of my dearest son, who laboured in my stead, 
in the church where I had been brought up and educated, 
and presided over the treasures of wisdom, to which my 
beloved master, archbishop Egbert, left me heir." Thus too 
to Charles Augustus :f ^^ Give me the more polished vo- 
lumes of scholastic learning, such as I used to have in my 
own country, through the laudable and ardent industry it 
my master, archbishop Egbert. And, if it please your wis- 
dom, I will send some of our youths, who may obtain thence 
whatever is necessary, and bring back into France the flow- 
ers of Britain ; that the garden of Paradise may not be con- 
fined to York, but that some of its scions may be transplanted 
to Tours." 

This is the same Alcuin, who, as I have said, was sent 
into France to treat of peace, and during his abode with 
Charles, captivated either by the pleasantness of the country 
or the kindness of the king, settled there ; and being held in 
high estimation, he taught the king, during his leisure from

and astronomj. Alcum was, of all the Angles, of whom I 
have read, next to St Aldhekn and Bede, certainlj the most 
learned, and has given proof of his talents in a varietj of 
compositions. He lies buried in France, at the church of 
St Paul, of Cormaric,* which monastery Charles the Great 
built at his suggestion : on which account, eyen at the pre- 
sent daj, the subsistence of four monks is distributed in 
ahns, for the soul of our Alcuin, in that church. 

But since I am arriyed at that point where the mention of 
Charles the Great naturally presents itself I shall subjoin a 
true statement of the descent of the kings of France, of 
which antiquity has said much : nor shall I depart widely 
from my design ; because to be unacquainted with their 
noe^ I hold as a defect in information ; seeing that they are 
oar near neighbours, and to them the Christian world chiefly 
looks up : and, perhaps, to glance over this compendium may 
giye pleasure to many who have not leisure to wade through 
Tolnminous works. 

The Franks were so called, by a Greek appellative, from 
the ferocity of their manners, when, by order of the emperor 
Valentinian the First, they ejected the Alani, who had 
i^etreated to the Madotian marshes. It is scarcely possible to 
helieve how much this people, few and mean at first, became 
increased by a ten years' exemption from taxes : such, before 
the war, being the condition on which they engaged in it 
Thus augmenting wonderfully by the acquisition of freedom, 
and first seizing the greatest part of Germany, and next the 
whde of Gaul, they tximpelled the inhabitants to Ust under 
their banners. Hence the Lotharingi and Allamanni, and 
other nations beyond the Rhine, who are subject to the 
emperor of Grermany, will have themselves more properly to 
he called Franks ; and those whom we suppose Franks, they 
^ by an ancient appellative Galwalae^ that is to say, Gauls. 
To this opinion I assent ; knowing that Charles the Great, 
whom none can deny to have b^ king of the Franks, 
always used the same vernacular language with the Franks 
on the other side of the Rhine. Any one who shall read the

life of Cliarles wOl readily admit the truth of my assertion.* 
in the year then of the Incarnate Word 425 the Franks 
were governed by Faramnnd, their first king. The grand- 
son of Faramund was Meroyeus, from whom all the suc- 
ceeding kings of the Franks, to the time of Pepin, were 
called Merovingians. In like manner the sons of the kings 
of the Angles took patronymical appellations from their 
fathers. For instance ; Ea^aring the son of Edgar ; Ead- 
munding the son of Edmund, and the rest in like manner ; 
commoidy, however, they are called ethelings. The native 
^ language of the Franks, therefore, partakes of that of the 
Angles, by reason of both nations originating from Germany. 
The Merovingians reigned successfully and powerfully till 
the year of our Lord's incarnation, 687. At that period 
Pepin, son of Ansegise, was made mayor of the palace | 
among the Franks, on the other side of the Rhine. Seizing 
opportunities for veiling his ambitious views, he completely 
subjugated his master Theodoric, the dregs as it were of the 
Merovingians, and to lessen the obloquy excited by the 
transaction, he indulged him with the empty title of king, 
while himself managed every thing, at home and abroad, 
according to his own pleasure. The genealogy of this Pepin, 
both to and from him, is thus traced : Ausbert, the senator, 
on Blithilde, the daughter of Lothaire, the father of Dago- 
bert, begot Arnold : Arnold begot St. Amulph, bishop of 
Metz : Amulph begot Flodulph, Walcthise, Aiischise : Flo- 
dulph begot duke Martin, whom Ebroin slew : Walcthise 
begot the most holy Wandregesil the abbat : duke Anschise 
begot Ansegise : Ansegise b^ot Pepin. The son of Pepin « 
was Carolus Tudites, whom they also call Martel, because he 
beat down the tyrants who were raising up in every part of 
France, and nobly defeated the Saracens, at that time infest- 
ing Gaul. Following the practice of his father, whilst he 
was himself satisfied with the title of earl, he kept the kings

in a state of pupilage. He left two sons, Pepin and Carolo- 
man. Caroloman, from some unknown cause, relinquishing 
the world, took his religious vows at Mount Cassin. Pepin 
was crowned king of the Franks, and patrician of the Ro- 
mans^ in the church of St. Denys, by pope Stephen, the suc- 
cessor of Zachary. For the Constantinopolitan emperor^ 
alreadj much degenerated from their ancient valour, giving 
no assistance either to Italy or the church of Rome, which 
had long groaned, under the tyranny of the Lombards, this 
pope bewailed the injuries to which they were exposed from 
them to the ruler of the Franks ; wherefore Pepin passing 
the Alps, reduced Desiderius, king of the Lombards, to such 
difEiculties, that he restored what he had plundered to the 
chnrch of Rome, and gave surety by oath that he would not 
attempt to resume it. Pepin returning to France after some 
years, died, leaving his surviving children, Charles and 
Carol<Hnan, his heirs. In two years Caroloman departed 
tkiii life. Charles obtaining the name of '' Great" from his 
exploits, enlarged the kingdom to twice the limits which it 
possessed in his father's time, and being contented for more 
than thirty years with the simple title of king, abstained 
from the appellation of emperor, though repeatedly invited 
to assume it by pope Adrian. But when, after the death of 
this pontiff his relations maimed the holy Leo, his successors 
in the church of St. Peter, so as to cut out his tongue, and 
put out his eyes, Charles hastily proceeded to Rome to settle 
the state of the church. Justly punishing these abandoned 
wretches, he stayed there the whole winter, and restored the 
pontiff now speaking plainly and seeing clearly, by the 
miraculous interposition of God, to his customary power. 
At that time the Roman people, with the privity of the pon- 
liS, on the day of our Lord's nativity, unexpectedly hailed 
him with the title of Augustus ; which title, though, from 
its being unusual, he reluctantly admitted, yet afterwards he 
defended with proper spirit against the Constantinopolitan 
emperors, and left it, as hereditary, to his son Louis. His 
descendants reigned in that country, which is now properly 
called France, till the time of Hugh, sumamed Capet, from 
whom is descended the present Louis. From the same stock

our Lord 912, when Conrad, king of the Teutonians, seized

that empire. The grandson of this personage was Otho the 
Great, equal in every estimable quality to any of the em- 
perors who preceded him. Thus admirable for his valour 
and goodness, he left the empire hereditary to his posterity ; 
for the present Henry, son-in-law of Henry, king of Eng- 
land, derives his lineage from his blood. 

To return to my narrative: Alcuin, though promoted by 
Charles the Great to the monastery of St. Martin in France, 
was not unmindful of his countrymen, but exerted himself 
to retain the emperor in amity with them, and stimulated 
them to virtue by frequent epistles. I shall here sul^oin 
many of his observations, from which it will appear clearly 
how soon after the death of Bede the love of learning de- 
clined even in his own monastery: and how quickly after 
the decease of Eadbert the kingdom of the Northumbrians 
came to ruin, through the prevalence of degenerate manners. 

He says thus to the monks of Wearmouth, among whom 
Bede had both lived and died, obliquely accusing them of 
having done the very thing which he begs them not to do, 
'^ Let the youths be accustomed to attend the praises of our 
heavenly King, not to dig up the burrows of foxes, or pursue 
the winding mazes of hares ; let them now learn the Holy 
Scriptures, that, when grown up, they may be able to in- 
struct others. Remember the most noble teacher of our 
times, Bede, the priest, what thirst for learning he had in 
his youth, what praise he now has among men, and what a 
far greater reward of glory with Grod.** Again, to those of 
York he says, " The Searcher of my heart is witness that it 
was not for lust of gold that I came to France or continued 
there, but for the necessities of the church.'' And thus to 
OfFa, king of the Mercians, " I was prepared to come to you 
with the presents of king Charles and to return to my coun- 
try, but it seemed more advisable to me, for the peace of my 
nation, to remain abroad, not knowing what I could have 
done among those persons, with whom no one can be secure, 
or able to proceed in any laudable pursuit. Behold every 
holy place is laid desolate by Pagans, the altars are polluted 
by perjury, the monasteries dishonoured by adultery, the 
earth itseff stained with the blood of rulers and of princes." 
Again, to king Ethelred, third in the sovereignty after Ead- 
bert, " Behold the church of St Cuthbert is sprinkled with

the blood of God's priests, despoiled of all its ornaments, 
and the holiest spot in Britain given up to Pagan nations to 
be plundered ; and where, after the departure of St. Paulinus 
from York, the Christian religion first took its rise in our 
own nation, there nusery and calamity took their rise also. 
What portends that shower of blood which in the time oi 
Lent, in the city of York, the capital of the whole kingdom, 
in the chorch of St Peter, the chief of the apostles, we saw 
tremendously falling on the northern side of the building 
fnnn the summit of the roof^ though the weather was fair ? 
Must not blood be expected to come upon the land from the 
northern r^ons?" Again, to Osbert, prince of the Mer- 
dans, '^Our kingdom of the Northumbrians has almost 
perished through internal dissensions and perjury." So also 
to Athelard, archbishop of Canterbury, ^^I speak this on 
account of the scourge which has lately fallen on that part 
of our island which has beeii inhabited by our fore&thers 
for nearly three hundred and forty years. It is recorded in 
the writings of Gildas, the wisest of the Britons, that those 
▼erj Britons ruined their country through the avarice and 
rapine of their princes, the iniquity and injustice of their 
judges, their bishops' neglect of preaching, the luxury and 
abandoned manners of the people. Let us be cautious that 
such vices become not prevalent in our times, in order that 
the divine favour may preserve our country to us in that 
happy prosperity for the future which it has hitherto in its 
most merdfol kindness vouchsafed us." 

It has been made evident, I think, what disgrace and what 
destruction the neglect of learning and the immoral manners 
of degenerate men brought upon England 1 These remarks 
obtain this place in my history merely for the purpose of 
cautioning my readers. 

Eadbert, then, rivalling his brother in piety, assumed the 
monastic habit, and gave place to Oswulph, his son, who 
being, without any cause on his part, slain by his subjects, 
was, after a twelvemonth's reign, succeeded by MolL Moll 
carried on the government with commendable diHgence for 
eleven years,* and then fell a victim to the treachery of

Alcred. Alcred in his tenth year was compelled by his 
countrymen to retire from the government which he had 
usurped. Ethelred too, the son of Moll, being elected king, 
was expelled by them at the end of five years. Alfwold 
was next hailed sovereign ; but he also^ at the end of eleven 
years, experienced the perfidy of the inhabitants, for he was 
cut off by assassination, though guiltless, as his distinguished 
interment at Hexham and divine miracles sufficiently declare. 
His nephew, Osred,* the son of Alcred, succeeding him, was 
expelled after the space of a year, and gave place to Ethel- 
red, who was also called Ethelbert. He was the son of 
Moll, also called Ethelwald, and, obtaining the kingdom 
after twelve years of exile, held it during four, at the end 
of which time, unable to escape the fate of his predecessora, 
he was cruelly murdered. At this, many of the bishops and 
nobles greatly shocked, fled from the country. Some indeed 
affirm that he was punished deservedly, because he had as- 
sented to the unjust murder of Osred, whereas he had it in 
his power to quit the sovereignty and restore him to his 
throne. Of the beginning of this reign Alcuin thus speaks : 
"Blessed be God, the only worker of miracles, Ethelred, 
the son of Ethelwald, went lately from the dungeon to the 
throne, from misery to grandeur; by the infancy of whose 
reign we are detained from coming to you.**! Of his death 
he writes t thus to Ofl& king of the Mercians: "Your es- 
teemed kindness is to understand that my lord, king Charles, 
often speaks to me of you with affection and sincerity, and 
in him you have the firmest friend. He therefore sends 
becoming presents to your love, and to the several sees of 
your kingdom. In like manner he had appointed presents 
for king Ethelred, and for the sees of his bishops, but» oh, 
dreadful to think, at the very moment of despatching these 
gifts and letters there came a sorrowful account, hf the 

* Otred, through a conspiracy of his nobles, had been deposed, and, 
after receiving the tonsure, was compelled to go into exile. Two jean 
after, induced by the promises and oaths of certain of the Northnmbrian

and put to death by the oi^er of Ethelred. Sim. Dunelm. a.i>, 790 — 2.

ambassadors who returned out of Scotland through your 
ooimtrj, of the faithlessness of the people, and the death 
of the king. So that Charles, withholding his liberal gifts, 
is so highly incensed against that nation as to call it per- 
fidious and perverse, and the murderer of its sovereignsi 
esteeming it worse than pagan; and had I not interceded 
be would haye already deprived them of every advantage 
within his reach, and have done them all the ii^ury in his 
power." 

After Ethelred no one durst ascend the throne;* each 
dreading the fate of his predecessor, and preferring a life 
of safety in inglorious ease^ to a tottering reign in anxious 
suspense: for most of the Northumbrian kings had ended 
their reigns by a death which was now become almost 
habituaL Thus being without a sovereign for thirty-three 
jearsy that province became an object of plunder and con- 
tempi to its neighbours. For when the Danes, who, as I 
have before related from the words of Alcuin, laid waste 
the holy places, on their return home represented to their 
countrymen the fruitfulness of the island, and the indolence 
of its inhabitants; these barbarians came over hastily, in 
great numbers, and obtained forcible possession of that part 
of the country, till the time we are speaking of : indeed they 
had a king of their own for many years, though he was sub- 
ordinate to the authority of the king of the West Saxons. 
However, after the lapse of these thirty-three years, king 
Egbert obtained the sovereignty of this province, as well as 
of the others, in the year of our Lord's incarnation 827, and 
the twentj-dghth of his reign. And since we have reached 
his timeSy mindful of our engagement, we shall speak briefly 
of the kingdom of the Mercians ; and this, as well because 
we admire brevity in relation, as that there is no great 
abundance of materials. 

* Tbit is not quite correct : Osbald was elected by a party to succeed

devolved on Eaidulf. Eardulf after a few years was driven into exile;

CHAPTER IV. 

Of the kings qf the Mercians. [ a.d. 626—674.} 

In the year of our Lord's incamation 626, and the hundred 
and thirty-ninth after the death of Hengist, Penda the son 
of Pybba, tenth in descent of Woden, of noble lines^e, ex- 
pert in war, but at the same time an irreligious heathen, at 
the age of fifty assumed the title* of king of the Mercians, 
after he had already fostered his presumption by frequent 
incursions on his neighbours. Seizing the sovereignty, 
therefore, with a mind loathing quiet and unconscious how 
great an enormity it was even to be victorious in a contest 
against his own countrymen, he began to attack the neigh- 
bouring cities, to invade the confines of the surrounding 
kings, and to fill everything with terror and confusion. For 
what would not that man attempt, who, by his lawless dar- 
ing, had extinguished those luminaries of Britain, Edwin 
and Oswald, kings of the Northumbrians, Sigebert, £<^ric, 
and Anna, kings of the East Angles ; men, in whom nobility 
of race was equalled by sanctity of life ? Kenwalk also, 
king of the West Saxons, after being frequently harassed 
by him, was driven into exile; though, perhaps, he deser- 
vedly paid the penalty of his perfidy towards God, in deny- 
ing his faith ; and towards Penda himself, in repudiating his 
sister. It is irksome to relate, how eagerly he watched op- 
portunities of slaughter, and as a raven flies greedily at the 
scent, of a carcase, so he joined Cadwalla,! and was of in- 
finite service to him, in recovering his dominions. In this 
manner, for thirty years, he attacked his countrymen, but 
did nothing worthy of record against strangers. His insa- 
tiable desires, however, at last found an end suitable to their 
deserts ; for being routed, with his allies, by Oswy, who had 
succeeded his brother Oswald, more through the assistance 

* It would appear that Penda was not the fint king, but the BnA of 
any note. Hen. Huntingdon assigns the origin of the kingdom to about 
the year 584 under Grida, who was succeeded, in the year 600, by Pybba; 
Ceorl came to the throne in 610, and Penda in 626. See H. Hast, 
f. 181, 184— b.

of God than bis military powers, Fenda increased the num- 
ber of infernal spirits. By bis queen Kyneswitb bis sons 
were Peada, Wulfbere, Etbelred, Merwal, and Mercelin; 
bis daughters, Kyneburg, and Kyneswith ; both distinguished 
for inviolable chastity. Thus the parent, though ever re- 
bellious towards Grod, produced a most holy offspring for 
Heaven. 

His son Peada succeeded him in a portion of the kingdom, 
by the permission of Oswy, advanced to the government of 
the South Mercians ; a young man of talents, and even in 
his father's lifetime son-in-law to Oswy. For he had re- 
ceived his daughter, on condition of renouncing paganism 
and embracing Christianitj; in which faith he would soon 
have caused Uie province of participate, the peaceful state 
of the kingdom and his father-in-law's consent tending to 
such a purpose, had not bis death, hastened, as they say, by 
the intrigues of bis wife, intercepted these joyful prospects. 
Then Oswy resumed the government, which seemed rightly 
to appertain to him from bis victory over the father, and 
from his affinity to the son. The spirit, however, of tne 
inhabitants could not brook his authority more than three 
years; for they expeUed his generals, and Wulfbere, the 
son of Fenda, being hailed as his successor, the province 
recovered its liberty. 

Wulfbere, that he might not disappoint the hopes of the 
nation, began to act with energy, to show himself an efficient 
prince by great exertions both mental and personal, and 
finally to afford Christianity, introduced by his brother and 
yet hardly breathing in his kingdom, every possible assist- 
ance. In the early years of his reign he was heavily op- 
pressed by the king of the West Saxons, but in succeeding 
times, repelling the injury by the energy of his measures, he 
deprived him of the sovereignty of the Isle of Wight ; and 
leading it, yet panting after heathen rites, into the proper 
path, he soon after bestowed it on his godson, Ethelwalch, 
king of the South Saxons, as a recompence for his faith. 
But these and all his other good qualities ar^ stained and 
deteriorated by the dreadful brand of simony ; because he, 
first of the kings of the Angles, sold the sacred bishopric 
of London to one Wini, an ambitious man. His wife was 
Ermenbilda, the daughter of Eroonbert, king of Kent, of

whom lie begat Kinred, aad Wereburga, a most holj yiigin 
who lies buried at Chester. His brother Merewald married 
Ermenburga, the daughter of Ermenred, brother of the same 
Erconbert ; bj her he had issue, three daughters ; Milbui^ 
who lies at Weneloch ; Mildritha in Kent, in the monastery 
of St. Augustine ; and Milgitha : and one son, Merefin. Al- 
frid king of th^ Northumbrians married Kjneburg, daoghter 
of Penda: who, after a time, disgusted with w^ock, took 
the habit of a nun in the monastery which her brothers^ 
Wulfhere and Ethelred, had founded. 

Wulf here died at the end of nineteen years, and his bro- 
ther Ethelred ascended the throne ; more famed for his pious 
disposition than his skill in war. Moreover he was satisfied 
with displaying his valour in a single but illustrious expe- 
dition into Kent, and passed the remainder of his life in 
quiet, except that attacking Egfirid, king of the Northnm- 
brians, who had passed beyond the limits of his kingdono, 
he admonished him to return home, by the murder of his 
brother Elfwin. He atoned however for this slaughter, 
after due deliberation, at the instance of St. Theodore, the 
archbishop, by giving Egfrid a large sum of money.* Sub* 
sequently to this, in the thirtieth year of his reign, he took 
the cowl, and became a monk at Bardney, of which monas- 
tery he was ultimately promoted to be abbat. This is the 
same person who was contemporary with Ina, king of the 
West Saxons, and confirmed by his authority also the privi- 
lege which St. Aldhelm brought from Rome. His wife was 
Ostritha, sister of Egfrid, king of the Northumbrians!, by 
whom she had issue a son named Ceolred. 

He appointed Kenred, the son of his brother Wulfhere his 
successor, who, equally celebrated for piety to God and 
uprightness towards his subjects, ran his mortal race virith 
great purity of manners, and proceeding to Rome in the 
fifth year of his reign, passed the remainder of his life there 
in the offices of religion ; chiefiy instigated to this by the 
melancholy departure of a soldier, who, as Bede relateSyf 

* This was bj paying to his rehitiTes his weregild, or the I^gal price of 
his blood; for all, from the king to the slave, had their established Talue. 
One moiety, only, of the weregild went to the family of the murdered 
person; the other went into the public purse. 

t Etbelbald had been frequently exhorted by the king to make con* 
tumon of his tran^greanons^ but had constantly declined it. At last bemg

disdaining to confess his crimes when in health, saw, 
manifestlj, when at the point of death, those veiy demons 
coming to punish him to whose vicioiis allarements he had 
sarrendered his souL 

After him reigned Ceobed, the son of £thelred his uncle, 
is conspicuous for his valour against Ina, as pitiable for an 
early death ; for not filling the throne more than eight years, 
he was buried at Lichfield, leaving Ethelbald, the grand- 
nephew of Penda by his brother Alwy, his heir. This king, 
enjoying the sovereignty in profound and long-continued 
peace, that is, for the space of forty-one years, was ultimately 
killed by his subjects, and thus met with a reverse of fortune. 
Bemred, the author of his death, left nothing worthy of 
record, except that afterwards, being himself put to death by 
Offa, he received the just reward of his treachery. To this 
Ethelbald, Boniface,* archbishop of Mentz, an Angle by 
nation, who was subsequently crowned with martyrdom, sent 
an epistle, part of which I shall transcribe, that it may 
appear how freely he asserts those very vices to have already 
gained ground among the Angles of which Alcuin in after 
times was apprehensive. It will also be a strong proof, by 
the remarkable deaths of certain kings, how severely God 
punishes those guilty persons for whom his long-suspended 
anger mercifully waits. 

f ** To Etheutaldf my dearest lordy and to he preferred to 
all other kings of the Angles, in the love of Christ, Boniface 
the archbishop, legate to Germany from the church of Borne, 

taxed with nckneiB, he appeen to have imagined that he bbw two angels 
approach with a very nnAll Tolume, in which were written the few good 
aetwna he had erer perfbnned ; when immediately a large company of 
demons advancing, display another book of enormous bulk and weight, 
eootaining all hii evil deeds, which are read to him ; after which, asserting 
their claim to the sinner agftinst the angels, they strike him on the head and 
feet, as sjnoptonos of his approaching end. Bede, b. v. c. 13.

wUheth perpetual heaUk in Christ. We confess before €rod 
that when we hear of jour prosperity, your faith, and good 
works, we rejoice ; and if at any time we hear of any 
adversity befaUen you, either in the chance of war or the 
jeopardy of your soul, we are afflicted. We have heard that, 
devoted to ahnsgiving, you prohibit theft and rapine, are a 
lover of peace, a defender of widows, and of the poor ; and 
for this we give Grod thanks. Your contempt for lawful 
matrimony, were it for chastity's sake, would be laudable ; 
but since you wallow in luxury and even in adultery with 
nuns, it is disgraceful and danmable ; it dims the brightness 
of your glory before Grod and man, and transforms you into 
an idolater, because you have polluted the temple of Grod. 
Wherefore, my beloved son, repent, and remember how 
dishonourable it is, that you, who, by the grant of Grod, are 
sovereign over many nations, should yoursdf be the slave of 
lust to his disservice. Moreover, we have heard that almost 
all the nobles of the Mercian kingdom, following your 
example, desert their lawful wives and live in guilty 
intercourse with adultresses and nuns. Let the custom of a 
foreign country teach you how far distant this is from 
rectitude. For in old Saxony, where there is no knowledge 
of Christ, if a virgin in her father's house, or a married 
woman under the protection of her husband, should be guilty 
of adultery, they bum her, strangled by her own hand, and 
hang up her seducer over the grave where she is buried ; or 
else, cutting off her garments to the waist, modest matrons 
whip her and pierce her with knives, and fresh tormentors 
punish her in tiie same manner as she goes from town to 
town, till they destroy her. Again the Winedi,* the basest 
of nations, have this custom — ^the wife, on the death of her 
husband, casts herself on the same funeral pile to be 
consumed with him. K then the gentiles, who know not 
God, have so zealous a regard for chastity, how much more 
ought you to possess, my beloved son, who are both a 
Christian and a king ? Spare therefore your own soul, spare 
a multitude of people, perishing by your example, for whose 
souls you must give account Give heed to this too, if the 
nation of the Angles, (and we are reproached in France and

in Italy and by the very pagans for it,) despising lawful 
matrimony, give free indulgence to adultery, a race ignoble 
and despising God must necessarily proceed from such a 
mixture, which will destroy the counti^ by their abandoned 
manners, as was the case with the Burgundians, ProYen9al8, 
and Spaniards, whom the Saracens harassed for many years 
on account of their past transgressions. Moreover, it has 
been told us, that you take away from the churches and 
monasteries many of their privileges, and excite, by your 
example, your nobility to do the like. But recollect, I 
entreat you, what terrible vengeance Grod hath indicted upon 
fonner kings, guilty of the crime we lay to your charge. 
For Ceolred, your predecessor, the debaucher of nuns, the 
in^ger of ecclesiastical privileges, was seized, while 
splendidly regaling with his nobles, by a malignant spirit, 
who snatched away his soul without confession and without 
communion, while in converse with the devil and despising 
the law of Grod. He drove Osred also, king of the Deirans 
and Bemicians, who was guilty of the same crimes, to such 
excess that he lost his kingdom and perished in early 
manhood by an ignominious death. Charles also, governor 
of the Franks, the subverter of many monasteries and the 
ippropriator of ecclesiastical revenues to his own use, 
perished by excruciating pain and a fearful death." And 
afterwards, "Wherefore, my beloved son, we entreat with 
paternal and fervent prayers that you would not despise the 
counsel of your fathers, who, for the love of God, anxiously 
appeal to your highness. For nothing is more salutary to a 
good king than the willing correction of such crimes when 
^7 are pointed out to him ; since Solomon says ' Whoso 
loveth instruction, loveth wisdom.* Wherefore, my dearest 
son, showing you good counsel, we call you to witness, and 
entreat you by the living God, and his Son Jesus Christ, 
ttd by the Holy Spirit, that you would recollect how 
fleeting is the present life, how short and momentary is the 
delight of the filthy flesh, and how ignominious for a person 
of transitory existence to leave a bad example to posterity. 
^€gin therefore to regulate your life by better habits, and cor- 
fect the past errors of your youth, that you may have praise 
before men here, and be blest with eternal glory hereafter. 
We wish your Highness health and proficiency in virtue.** 



76 WILLIAM OF 1CA.LMB8BUBT. Lb. i.e. 4. 

I have inserted in mj narrative portions of tlus episUe, 
to give sufficient knowledge of these circumstances, partlj in 
the words of the author and partlj in mj own, shortening 
the sentences as seemed proper, for which I shall easilj be 
be excused, because there was need of brevity for the sake of 
those who were eager to resume the thread of the history. 
Moreover, Boniface transmitted an epistle of like import to 
archbishop Cuthbert, adding that he should remonstrate 
with the clergy and nuns on the fineness and vanity of their 
dress. Besides, that he might not wonder at his interfering 
in that in which he had no apparent concern, that is to say, 
how or with what manners the nation of the Angles con- 
ducted itself, he gave him to understand, that he had bound 
himself by oath to pope Gregory the Third, not to conceal 
the conduct of the nations near him from the knowledge of 
the apostolical see ; wherefore, if mild measures failed of suc- 
cess, he should take care to act in such manner, that vices of 
this kind should not be kept secret from the pope. Indeed, 
on account of the fine texture of the dencal vestments, 
Alcuin obliquely glances at Athelard the archbishop, Cuth- 
bert's successor, reminding him that, when he should come 
to Rome to visit the emperor Charles the Great^ the grandson 
of Charles of whom Boniface was speaking above, he should 
not bring the clergy or monks dressed in party-coloured or 
gaudy garments, for the clergy amongst the Franks dressed 
only in ecclesiastical habits. 

Nor could the letters of so great a man, which he was 
accustomed to send from watchful regard to his legation 
and pure love of his country, be without efiect. For both 
Cuthbert, the archbishop, and king Ethelbald summoned a 
council for the purpose of retrenching the superfluities which 
he had stigmatised. The acts of this synod, veiled in a 
multiplicity of words, I shall forbear to add, as I think they 
will better accord with another part of my work, when I 
come to the succession of the bishops : but as I am now on 
the subject of kingly affairs, I shall subjoin a charter of 
Ethelbflld's, as a proof of his devotion, because it took place 
in the same oounciL 

'' It often happens, through the uncertain change of times, 
that those things which have been confirmed by the testi- 
mony and ad^dce of many faithful persons, have been made

of none effect hj the oontumacj of very many, or by the 
artifices of deceit^ without any regard to justice, unless they 
bare been committed to eternal memory by the authority of 
writing and the testimony of charters. Wherefore I Ethel- 
bald, king of the Mercians, out of love to heaven and regard 
for my own soul, have felt the necessity of considering how 
I may, by good works, set it free from every tie of sin. For 
since the Omnipotent God, through the greatness of his 
clemency, without any previous merit on my part, hath be- 
stowed on me the sceptre of government, therefore I willingly 
repay him out of that which he hath given. On this account 
I grant, so long as I live, that all monasteries and churches 
of my kingdom shall be exempted from public taxes, works, 
and impositions, except the building of forts and bridges, 
from which none can be released. And moreover the ser- 
vants of God shall have perfect liberty in the produce of 
their woods and lands, and the right of fishing, nor shall they 
bring presents either to king or princes except voluntarily, 
bat tiiey shall serve God without molestation." 

Lullus* succeeded Boniface, an Englishman by birth also ; 
of whose sanctity mention is made in the life of St. Goar, 
and these verses, which I remember to have heard from my 
earliest childhood, bear witness : 

** LttUiu, than whom no holier prelate lives, 
Bj God*B aadstance healing medicine gives, 
Cures each disorder by his powerful hand, 
And with his gloxy ovenpreads the land." 

However, to return to my history, Offa, descended from 
Penda in the fifth degree, succeeded Ethelbald. He was a 
a man of* great mind, and one who endeavoured to bring to 
effect whatever he had preconceived ; he reigned thirty-nine 
years. When I consider the deeds of this person, I am 
doabtful whether I should commend or censure. At one 
time, in the same character, vices were so palliated by virtues,

West Saxons, he easily gained the victory, though the other 
was a celebrated warrior. When he thought artifice would 
better suit his purpose, this same man beheaded king Ethel- 
bert, who had come to him through the allurement of great 
promises^ and was at that very time within the walls of his 
palace, soothe into security by his perfidious attentions, and 
then unjustly seized upon the kingdom of the East Angles 
which Ethelbert had held. 

The relics of St. Alban, at that time obscurely buried, he 
ordered to be reverently taken up and placed in a shrine, 
decorated to the fullest extent of royal munificence, with 
gold and jewels ; a church of most beautiful workmanship 
was there erected, and a society of monks assembled. Yet 
rebellious against God, he endeavoured to remove the archi- 
episcopal see formerly settled at Canterbury, to Lichfield, 
envying^ forsooth, the men of Kent the dignity of the arch- 
bishopric : on which account he at last deprived Lambert, 
the archbishop, worn out with continual exertion, and who 
produced many edicts of the apostolical see, both ancient and 
modem, of all possessions within his territories, as well as 
of the jurisdiction over the bishoprics. From pope Adrian, 
therefore, whom he had wearied with plausible assertions for 
a long time, as many things not to be granted may be gradu- 
ally drawn and artfully wrested from minds intent on other 
occupations, he obtained that there should be an archbishopric 
of the Mercians at Lichfield, and that all the prelates of the 
Mercians should be subject to that province. Their names 
were as follow : Denebert, bishop of Worcester, Werenbert, 
of Leicester, Edulph, of Sidnacester, Wulpheard, of Here- 
ford ; and the bishops of the East Angles, Alpheard, of Ellm- 
ham, Tidfrid, of Dunwich ; the bishop of Lichfield w^as 
named Aldulph. Four bishops however remained sufiragan 
to Lambert, archbishop of Canterbury, London, Winchester, 
Rochester, and Selsey. Some of these bishoprics are now in 
being, some are removed to other places, others consolidated 
by venal interest, for Leicester, Sidnacester, and Dunwich, 
from som(i unknown cause, are no longer in existence. Nor 
did Ofia's rapacity stop here, for he showed himself a down- 
right public pilferer, by converting to his own use the lands 
of many churches, of which Malmesbury was one. But this 
iniquity did not long deform canonical institutions, for soon

after Eenul^ Offa's successor, inferior to no preceding king 
in power or in faith, transmitted a letter to Leo, the successor 
of Adrian, and restored Athelard who had succeeded Lambert, 
to his former dignity. Hence Alcuin, in an epistle to the 
same Athelard, says *' Having heard of the success of your 
journey, and your return to your country, and how you were 
received by the pope, I give thanks with every sentiment of 
my heart to the Lord our God, who, by. the precious gift of 
his mercy, directed your way with a prosperous progress, 
gave you favour in the sight of the pope, granted you to 
return home with the perfect accomplishment of your wishes, 
and hath condescended, through you, to restore the holiest 
seat of our first teacher to its pristine dignity." I think it 
proper to subjoin part of the king's epistle and also of the 
pope's, though I may seem by so doing to anticipate the 
r^ular order of time ; but I shall do it on this account, that 
it is a task of greater difficulty to blend together disjointed 
facts than to despatch those I had begun. 

'' To the most holy and trtdy loving lord Leo^ pontiff of 
the sacred and apostolical see^ Kenulfy hy the grace of God 
king of the Mercians^ with the bishops, princes, and every 
degree of dignity under our authority, sendeth the salutation 
of the purest love in Christ, 

" We give thanks ever to God Almighty, who is wont, by 
the means of new guides, the former being taken to the life 
eternal, to guide the church, purchased by his precious 
hlood, amid the diverse storms of this world, to the haven of 
salvation, and to shed fresh light upon it, in order that it be 
led into no error of darkness, but may pursue the path of 
truth without stumbling ; wherefore the universal church 
justly rejoices, that when the true rewarder of all good men 
took the most glorious pastor of his flock, Adrian, to be eter- 
nally rewarded in heaven, still his kind providence gave a 
shepherd to his flock, not less skilled, to conduct the sheep 
of God into the fold of life. We also, who live on the 
farthest confines of the world, justly boast, beyond all other 
things, that the church's exaltation is our safety, its pros- 
perity our constant ground of joy ; since your apostolical 
dignity and our true faith originate from the same source. 
Whentlbre I deem it fitting to incline the ear of our obe- 
dience^ with all due humility, to your holy commands, and

to fulfil, with every possible endeavour, what shall seem just 
to your piety for us to accomplish : but to avoid, and utterly 
r^ect, sdl that shall be found inconsistent with right. But 
now, I, Kenulf, by the grace of Grod king, humbly entreat 
your excellence that I may address you as I wish, without 
offence, on the subje<!t of our progress, that you may receive 
me with peaceful tranquillity into the bosom of your piety, 
and that the liberal bounty of your benediction may qualify 
me, gifted with no stock of merit, to rule my people ; in 
order that God may deign, through your intercession, to de- 
fend the nation, which, together with me, your apostolical 
authority has instructed in the rudiments of the faith, against 
all attacks of adversaries, and to extend that kingdom which 
he hath given. This benediction all the Mercian kings be- 
fore me were, by your predecessors, deemed worthy to ob- 
tain. This, I humbly beg, and this, O most holy man, I 
desire to receive, that you would more especially accept me 
as a son by adoption, as I love you as my father, and tdways 
honour you with all possible obedience. For among such 
great personages faith ever should be kept inviolate, as well 
as perfect love, because paternal love is to be looked upon as 
fihal happiness in God, according to the saying of Hezekiah, 
* A father will make known thy truth to his sons, O Lord.' 
In which words I implore you, loved father, not to deny 
to your unworthy son the knowledge of the Lord in your 
holy words, in order that, by your sound instruction, I may 
deserve, by the assistance of God, to come to a better course 
of life. And moreover, O most affectionate father, we beg, 
with all our bishops, and every person of rank among us, 
that, concerning the many inquiries on which we have 
thought it right to consult your wisdom, you would cour- 
teously reply, lest the traditions of the holy fathers and their 
instructiona should, through ignorance, be misunderstood by 
us ; but let your reply reach us in charity and meekness, 
that, through the mercy of God, it may bring forth fruit in 
us. The first thing our bishops and learned men allege is, 
that, contrary to the canons and papal constitutions enacted 
for our use by the direction of the most holy father Gregory, 
as you know, the jurisdiction of the metropolitan of Canter- 
bury is divided into two provinces, to whose power, by Uie 
same father's command, twelve bishops ought to be subject

M 18 read thronghoiit our churches, in the letter which he 
diieeted to his brother and fellow bishop, Augustine, con- 
eeming the two metropolitans of London and York, which 
letter doubtlessly you also possess. But that pontifical dig- 
nity, which was at that tune destined to Xiondon, with the 
honour and distinction of the pall, was, for his sake, removed 
and granted to Canterbury. For since Augustine, of blessed 
memory, who, at the command of St. Gregory, preached the 
word of Grod to the nation of the Angles, and so gloriously 
presided aver the church of the Saxons, died in that city, 
and his body was buried in the church of St. Peter, the chief 
of apostles, which his successor St. Laurentius consecrated, 
it seemed proper to the sages of our nation, that the metro- 
politan dignity should reside in that city where rests the 
body of the man who planted the true faith in these parts. 
The honour of this pre-eminence, as you know, king Offa 
first attempted to take away and to divide it into two pro- 
vinces, through enmity against the venerable Lambert and 
the Kentish people ; and your pious brother and predecessor, 
Adrian, at the request of the aforesaid king, first did what 
no ODe had before presumed, and honoured the prelate of the 
Mercians with the pall. But yet we blame neither of these 
persons, whom, as we believe, Christ crowns with eternal 
glory. Nevertheless we humbly entreat your excellence, on 
whom Grod hath deservedly conferred the key of wisdom, 
that yoa would consult with your counsellors on this subject, 
and condescend to transmit to us what may be necessary for 
OS to observe hereafter, and what may tend to the unity of 
real peace, as we wish, through your sound doctrine, lest the 
ooat of Christ, woven throughout without seam, should suffer 
any rent among us. We have written this to you, most holy 
fadier, with equal humility and regard, earnestly entreating 
your clemency, that you would kindly and justly reply to 
those things which have been of necessity submitted to you. 
Moreover we wish that you would examine, with pious love^ 
tha.t epistle which, in the presence of all our bishops, 
Athelard the archbishop wrote to you more fully on the sub- 
ject of his own affairs and necessities, as well as on those of 
all Britain ; that whatever the rule of faith requires in those 
matters which are contained therein, you would condescend 
tn^y to explain. Wherefore last year I sent my own em-

And how much more do we praise the Almighty for this

to us as being', what he really is, honourable, and skilful,

Boatehing them from inextinguishable fire, bringing them

biBbop St. Augustine, with the right of consecrating bishops^ 
to the full number of twelve. Hence we also, having ascer- 
tained the truth, have, bj our apostolical authority, placed all 
ordinations or confirmations on their ancient footing, and do 
restore them to him entire, and we deliver to him the grant 
of our confirmation, to be duly observed by his churchy 
according to the sacred canons." 

In the meantime 0£Pa, that the outrages against his 
countrymen might not secretly tend to his disadvantage, in 
order to conciliate the favour of neighbouring kings, gave 
his daughter Eadburga in marriage to Bertric, king of 
the West Saxons ; and obtained the amity of Charles the 
Great, king of the Franks, by repeated embassies, though 
he could find little in the disposition of Charles to second 
his views. They had disagreed before, insomuch that violent 
feuds having arisen on both sides, even the intercourse of 
traders* was prohibited. There is an epistle of Alcuin to 
this effect, part of which I shall subjoin, as it affords a strong 
proof of the magnanimity and valour of Charles, who spoit 
all his time in war against the Pagans, rebels to Grod. He 
says,* " The ancient Saxons and all the Friesland nations 
were converted to the faith of Christ through the exertions 
of king Charles, urging some with threats, and others with 
rewards. At the end of the year the king made an attack 
upon the Sdavonians and subjugated them to his power. 
The Avares, whom we call Huns, made a furious attempt 
upon Italy, but were conquered by the generals of the afore- 
said most Christian king, and returned home with disgrace. 
In like manner they rushed against Bavaria, and were again 
overcome and dispersed by the Christian army. Moreover 
the princes and conmianders of the same most Christian 
king took great part of Spain from tbe Saracens, to the ex- 
tent of tl^ee hundred miles along the sea coast : but, O 
shame I these accursed Saracens, who are the Hagarens, 
have dominion over the whole of Africa, and the larger part 
of Asia Miyor. I know not what will be our destination, for 
some ground of difference, fomented by the devil, has arisen 
between king Charles and king 0£Ea, so that, on both sides,

all navigation is prohibited the merchants. Some say that 
we are to be sent into those parts to treat of peace." 

In these words, in addition to what I have remarked above, 
anj carious person may determine how many years have 
elapsed since the Saracens invaded Africa and Asia Migor. 
And indeed, had not the mercy of God animated the native 
spirit of the emperors of the Franks, the pagans had long 
smce subjugated Europe also. For, holding the Constanti- 
Dopolitan emperors in contempt^ they possessed themselves of 
Sicily and Sardinia, the Balearic isles, and ahnost all the 
coimtries surrounded by the sea, with the exception of Crete, 
Bhodes, and Cypmis. In our time however they have been 
compelled to relinquish Sicily by the Normans, (Corsica and 
Sardinia by the Fisans, and great part of Asia and Jerusa- 
lem itself by the Franks and other nations of £urt>pe. But, 
as I shall have a fitter place to treat largely of these matters 
hereafter, I shall now subjoin, from the words of Charles 
himself, the treaty which was ratified between him and Offii 
king of the Mercians. 

^ CharleSy by the grcu:e of God king of the Franks and 
LombardSy and patrician of the Romans^ to his esteemed and 
dearest brother Offa king of the Mercians, sendeth health : — 
Iirst, we give thanks to God Almighty for the purity of the 
Catholic faith, which we find laudably expressed in your 
fetters. Concerning pilgrims, who for the love of God or 
the salvation of their souls, wish to visit the residence of the 
holy apostles, let them go peaceably without any molestation ; 
but if persons, not seeking the cause of religion, but that of 
gain, be found amongst them, let them pay the customary 
tolls in proper places. We will, too, that traders have due 
protection within our kingdom, according to our mandate, 
and if in any place they sufier wrongful oppression, let them 
appeal to us or to our judges, and we will see full justice 
done. Let your kindness also be apprized that we have sent 
some token of our regard, out of our dalmatics* and palls, to 
each q>iscopal see of your kingdom or of Ethelred's, as an

pnnces. Its name is said to have been derived from its invention in Dal- 
Diatia. The pall here apparently signifies an upper vesture also, in form 
resembling a doak without sleeves ; but it has a variety of meanings. See

almsgrving, on accountof oar apostolical lord Adrian, eameatlj 
begging that you wonid order him to be prayed for, not as 
doubting that his blessed soul is at rest, but to show our 
esteem and r<^ard to our dearest friend. Moreorer we haTe 
sent somewhat out of the treasure of those earthly riches, 
which the Lord Jesus hath granted to us of his unmerited 
bounty, for the metropolitan dties, and for yourself a behy an 
Hungarian sword, and two silk doaks.** 

I hare inserted these brief extracts from the epistle that 
posterity may be clearly acquainted with the friendship d 
Ofia and Charles ; confiding in which friendly intereonne, 
although assailed by the habned of numbers, he passed the 
rest of his life in uninterrupted quiet, and saw Egfert hia 
son anointed to succeed him. This Egfert studiously avoided 
the cruel path trod by his father, and devoutly restored the 
privileges of all the churches which OSk had in his time 
abridged. The possessions also which his father had taken 
from Malmesbury he restored into the hands of Cuthbert, 
then abbat of that place, at the admonition of the aforesaid 
Athelard archbishop of Canterbury, a man of energy and a 
worthy servant of Grod, and who is uniformly asserted to 
have been its abbat before Cuthbert, from the circumstaaee 
of his choosing there to be buried. But while the hope0 of 
Egfert's noble qualities were ripening, in the first moments 
of his reign, untimely death cropped the flower of his yoatii- 
ful prime ; on which account Alcuin writing to the patrician 
Osbert, says, *' I do not think that the most noble youth Eg- 
fert died for his own sins, but because his father, in the es- 
tablishment of his kingdom, shed a deluge of blood." Dying 
after a reign of four months, he appointed Kenulf^ nephew 
of Penda in the fifth degree by his brother Eenwalk, to suc- 
ceed him. 

Kenulf was a truly great man, and surpassed, his fame by 
his virtues, doing nothing that malice could justly find fault 
with. Beligious at home, victorious abroad, his praises will 
be deservedly extolled so long as an impartial judge can be 
found in England. Equally to be admired for the extent of 
his power and for the lowliness of his mind ; of which he 
gave an eminent proof in restoring, as we have related, its 
faltering dignity to Canterbury, he little regarded earthly gran- 
deur in his own kingdom at l^e expense of deviating from

aneieBtlj-eigoiiied canons. Taking op Offi&'s hatred against 
tiie Kentiah people, he sorelj afflicted that proTince, and led 
away o^ve their king Eadbert^ sumamed Pren ; but not 
hmg after, jaaoved vith sestiinentB of pitjr, he released him. 
For at Winchelcombe^ where he had buUt a ebnrch to God, 
which jet remains, on the day of its dedication he freed the 
ci^ve Idx^ at the altar, and consoled him with liberty ; 
tliereby giving a memorable instance of his clemency. 
Catltfed,* whom he had made king over the Kentish people, 
was present to applaud this act of royal moidficence. The 
churdi resounded with aodamstions^ the street shook with 
crowds of people, lor in an assembly of thirteen bishops and 
ten dukes, no one was refused a largess, sill departed with 
foil purses. Moreover, in addition to those presents of in- 
estimable price and number in utensUs, clothes, and select 
honeOf which the chief nolnlity received, he gave to all who 
<iid not possess landed pr o pei'tyf a pound of silver, to each 
prsBbyter a Bkarca of gold, to every monk a shilling, and 
lastly he made many presents to the people at large. After 
ke had endowed the monastery with such ample revenues as 
would seem incredible in llie present time, he honoured it by 
his sepulture^ in the twenty-fourth year of his reign. His 
son Kenelm, of tender age, and undeservedly murdered by 
kis sister Quendrida, gained the title and distinction of mar- 
tyrdom, and rests in the same pkce. 

After him the kingdom of the Mercians sank from its 
prosperity, and becoming nearly lifeless, produced nothing 
worthy to be mentioned in history. However, that no one 
nay accuse me of leaving the history imperfect^ I shall glance 
o?er the names of the kings in succession. Geolwul^ the 
brother of Kenul^ reigning one year was expelled in the 
second by Bemulf ; who in the third year of his reign being 
overcome and put to flight by ]^b^ king of the West 
Saxons, was a^rwards slain by the East Angles, because 
ke had attempted to seize on East Anglia, as a kingdom sub- 
ject to the Mercians from the time of Offa. Ludecan, after

a reign of two years, was despatched by these Angles, as he 
was preparing to avenge his predecessor : Withlaf, subjuga- 
ted in the commencement of his reign by the before-men- 
tioned Egbert^ governed thirteen years, paying tribute to 
him and to his son, both for his person and his property : 
Berthwulf reigning thirteen years on the same conditions^ 
was at last driven by the Danish pirates beyond the sea : 
Burhred marrying EthdLawith, the daughter of king Ethel- 
wulf, the son of Egbert, exonerated himself, by this affinity, 
from the payment of tribute and the depredations of the 
enemy, but after twenty-two years, driven by them fixim his 
coun^, he fled to Rome, and was there buried at the school 
of the Angles, in the church of St. Mary ; his wife, at thai 
time continuing in this country, but afterwards following her 
husband, died at Pavia. The kingdom was next given by 
the Danes to one Celwulf, an attendant of Burhred's, who 
bound himself by oath that he would retain it only at their 
pleasure : after a few years it fell under the dominion of 
Alfred, the grandson of Egbert Thus the sovereignty of 
the Mercians, which prematurely bloomed by the overween- 
ing ambition of an heathen, altogether withered away through 
the inactivity of a driveller king, in the year of our Lord's 
incarnation eight hundred and seventy-five. 

CHAP. V. 

Of the kingt qf the East Angles, [▲.d. 520—905.] 

As my narrative has hitherto treated of the history of the 
four more powerful kingdoms in as copious a manner, I trust, 
as the perusal of ancient writers has enabled me, I shall now, 
as last in point of order, run through the governments of the 
East Angles and East Saxons, as suggested in my preface. 
The kingdom of the East Angles arose anterior to the West 
Saxons, though posterior to the kingdom of Kent. The first * 
and also the greatest king of the East Angles was Redwald, 
tenth in descent from Woden as they affirm ; for all the 
southern provinces of the Angles and Saxons on this side of 

* Redwald was not the first long of East AnglU, hut the first who be- 
came distlnguiahed. In the year 571, Ufb assumed the title of king : he 
was succeeded by his son, Titil, in 578 who was followed bj Redwald, his 
sun. See Bede, b. u. e. 15. 



A.n.ne-793.] BOHFWALD — iEDMUHD. 89 

the river Humber, with their kings, were snbject to his autho- 
rity. This b the person whom I have formerly mentioned 
as having, out of regard for Edwin, killed Ethelfrid, king of 
the Northumbrians. Through the persuasion of Edwin too 
he was baptized ; and after, at the instigation of his wife, 
abjured the faith. His son, Eorpwald, embraced pure Chris- 
tianity, and poured out his immaculate spirit to Grod, being 
barbflTOusly murdered by the heathen Richbert. To him 
succeeded Sigebert, his brother by the mother^s side, a wor- 
thy servant of the Lord, polished from all barbarism by his 
education among the Franks. For, being driven into bajoish- 
ment by Redwald, and for a long time associating with them, 
he had received the rites of Christianity, which, on his 
coming into power he graciously communicated to the whole 
of his kingdom, and also instituted schoob of learning in 
different places. This ought highly to be extolled : as men 
heretofore uncivilized and irreligious, were enabled, by his 
means, to taste the sweets of literature. The promoter of 
his studies and the stimulator of his religion was Felix the 
bishop, a Burgundian by birth, who now lies buried at Ram- 
sey. Sigebert moreover renoundng the world and taking 
the monastic vow, left the throne to his relation, Ecgric, 
with whom, being attacked in intestine war by Penda, king 
of the Mercians, he met his death, at the moment when, 
superior to his misfortunes, and mindful of his religious pro- 
fession, he held only a wand in his hand. The successor of 
£cgric was Anna, the son of Eni, the brother of Redwald, 
iovolved in similar destruction by the same furious Penda ; 
he was blessed with a numerous and noble offspring, as the 
second book will declare in its proper place. To Anna suc- 
ceeded his brother Ethelhere, who was justly slain by Oswy 
king of the Northumbrians, together with Penda, because he 
yrta an auxiliary to him, and was actually supporting the 
very army which had destroyed his brother and his kinsman. 
His brother Ethelwald, in due succession, left the kingdom 
to Adulf and Elwold, the sons of Ethdhere. Next came 
Bemred. After him Ethelred. His son was St. Ethelbert, 
whom Offa king of the Mercians killed through treachery, as 
has already been said, and will be repeated hereafter. After 
him, through the violence of the Mercians, few kings reigned 
in Eastern Anglia till the time of St. Edmund^ and he was

their own country for fifty years. For the province was 
nine years without a king, owing to the continued devasta- 
tions of the pagans ; afterwards hoth in it and in East Sax-

the time of king Alfred. Gothrun had for successor a Dane 
also^ hy name Eohric, who, after he had reigned fourteen 
years, was taken off hy the Angles, hecause he conducted 
himself with cruelty towards them. Still, however, liberty 
beamed not on this peqple, for the Danish earls continued to 
oppress them, or else to excite them against the kings of the 
West Saxons, till Edward, the son of Alfred, added both 
provinces to his own West Saxon empire, expelling the 
Danes and freeii^ the Angles. This event took place in the 
fiftieth year afW the murder of St Edmund, kii^ and

Saxons, they paid the penalty of thdr persecution against

of bishop Ceddy* the faith which thej had expelled together 
with Mdlitas. Afber gknionslj goyeming the kingdom, he 
left it in a manner still more glorious ; for he was murdered b j 
his near relations, merely because^ in confonnitj to the gos-

with harsh and angry eountenance, if thej were penitent^ 
those who had offended him. His brother Suidehn, baptised

Sghere, the son of Sigbert the Small, and Sebbi, the son of 
Seward, held the sorereignly. Sebbi's associate dying, he 
himself voluntarilj retired from the kingdom in his thirtieth 
year, beooooing a monk, as Bede rehites. His sons Sighard and 
Suefired reigned after him. On their decease Oflfa, the son 
Sighere^ governed the kingdom for a short time ; a youth of 
engaging countenance and disposition, in the flower of his 
age^ and highly belored by his sutj^ects. He, through the 
persuasion ^ Kjneswith, daughter of king Penda, whom he 
had anxiouslj sought in marriage, being taught to aspire 
after heavenly affections, went to Borne with Eenred king of 
the MerciaoB, and St Edwin Inshop of Worcester ; and

during thirty-eight years ; who being shdn, Swithed assumed 
the sovereignty of liie East Saxons ;| but in the same year 
that Egbert king of the West Saxons subdued Kent, being 
expelled by him, he vacated the kingdom ; though London^

The kings of the West Saxons ruled in Wiltshire, Berk- 
hire, and Dorsetshire ; in which there is one bishop, whose 
see is now at Sarum or Salisbury ; formerly it was at Bams- 
buiy, or at Sherborne : in Sussex, which for some little time 
possessed a king of its own ;* the episcopal see of this 
county was anciently in the island of Selsey, as Bede reUtes, 
where St. WUfrid built a monastery ; the bishop now dwells 
at Chichester : in the counties of Southampton and Surrey ; 
which have a bishops whose see is at Winchester : in tiie 
county of Somerset, which formerly had a bishop at Wells, 
but now at Bath : and in Domnonia, now called Devonshire, 
and Comubia, now Cornwall ; at that time there wece two 
bishoprics, one at Crediton, the other at St Grerman's ; now 
there is but one, and the see is at Exeter. 

The kings of the Mercians governed the coimties of Glou- 
cester, Worcester, and Warwick ; in these is one bishop 
whose residence is at Worcester : in Cheshire, Derbyshire, 
and Staffordshire ; these have one bishops who has part of 
Warwickshire and Shropshire ; his residence is at the city 
of Legions, that is Chester or Coventry ; formerly it was at 
Lichfield : in Herefordshire ; and there is a bishop having 
half Shropshire and part of Warwickshire, and Gloucester- 
shire ; whose residence is at Hereford : in Oxfordshire, 
Buckinghamshire, Hertfordshire, Huntingdonshire^ half of 
Bedfordshire, Northamptonshire, Leicestershire, Lincoln- 
shire ; which counties are under the jurisdiction of a bishop 
now resident at Lincoln, but formerly at Dorchester in the 
county of Oxford : in Leicestershire and Nottinghamshire, 
which belcmg to the diocese of York ; formerly they had 
their own bishop, whose seat was at Leicester. 

The kings of the East Angles had dominion over the 
county of Cambridge ; there is a bishop, whose seat is at 
Ely : and in Norfolk and Suffolk : whose see is at Norwich ; 
formerly at Elmham or Thetford.

aeXf and half of Hertfordshire ; where there anciently was, 
and still remains, the bishop of London. 

The kings of the Northumbrians governed all the country 
which is beyond the river Humber, even into Scotland :; and 
there were the archbishop of York, the bishops of Hexham, 
of Ripon, of Lindisfame, and of Candida Casa [ Whitheme] ; 
Hexham and Ripon are no more ; Lindisfame is translated 
to Durham. 

Such were the divisions of the kingdom of England, 
although the kings, according to the vicissitude of the times, 
now one, and then the other, would exceed their boundaries 
through their courage, or lose them by their indolence ; but 
an these several kingdoms Egbert subjugated by his abiUties, 
and consolidated into one empire, reserving to each their own 
laws. Wherefore, since I have passed beyond his times, ful- 
filling my promise in a review of the different periods, I will 
here fix the limits of my first volume, that the various tracks 
of the difiTerent kingdoms may unite in the general path of 
the West Saxon Empire. 



BOOK IL 

PROLOGUE. 



A ix>NG period has elapsed since, as well through the care of 
my parents as my own industry, I became familiar with 
books. This pleasure possessed me from my childhood : this 
ioorce of delight has grown with my years. Lideed I was 
so instructed by my father, that, had I turned aside to other 
pniBuits, I should have considered it as jeopardy to my soul 
and discredit to my character. Wherefore mindful of the 
adage "covet what is necessary," I constrained my early 
age to desire eagerly that which it was disgraceful not to 
poflsess. I gave, indeed, my attention to various branches of 
fiterature, but in different degrees. Lc^c, for instance, 
which gives arms to eloquence, I contented myself with 
barely hearing. Medicine, which ministers to the health of 
the body, I studied with somewhat more attention. But 
now, having scrupulously examined the several branches of

EtiucSy I bow down to its nugeety, because it sponCaneoiiaij 
unveils itself to those who study it^ and directs their minds 
to moral practice ; History more especiallj ; which, l^ an 
agreeable recapitulation of past events, excites its readers, hj 
example, to frame their lives to the pursuit of good, or to 
aversion from evil. When, therefore, at mj own expense, I 
had procured some histcnians of foreign nations, I proceeded, 
during my domestic leisure, to inquire if any thing con- 
cerning our own country could be found worthy of lAtiHing 
down to posterity. Hence it arose, that, not content with 
tiie writings of ancient times, I began, myself to compose ; 
not indeed to display my learning, which is comparative 
nothing, but to bnng to light ev^its lying ccmcealed in the 
confused mass of antiquity. In consequence rejecting vague 
opinions, I have studiously sought for chronicles far and near, 
though I confess I have scarcely profited any thing by tbaa 
industry. For perusing them all, I still remained poor m 
information ; though I ceased not my researehes as long as I 
could find any thing to read. However, what I have cleaiij 
ascertained concerning the four kingdoms, I have inserted in 
my first book, in which I hope truth will find no cause to 
blush, though perhaps a degree of doubt may sometimes 
arise. I shall now trace ihe monarchy of the West Saxon 
kingdom, through the line of successive princes, down to the 
ooming of the Normans : which if any person will conde- 
scend to regard with complacency, let him in brotherly love 
observe the following rule : "If before, he knew only these 
things, let him not be disgusted because I have inserted 
them ; if he shall know more, let him not be angry that I 
have not spoken of them ; ** but rather let him communicate 
his knowledge to me, while I yet live, that at least, those 
events may appear in the margin of my history^ which do 
not occur in the text.

Britain were consolidated into one. Egbert, the founder of

edocated, had been oonqpicnofas among the West Saxons 
fimi his chiidhoocL His iminterrupted eonrse of valour 
begat envy, and as it is almost naturallj ordained that kings 
should regard with suspicion whomsoever thej see growing 
1^ in expectation of the kingdom, Bertric, as before related^ 
jealoDS of his rising character, was meditating how to 
destroy him. Egbert, apprised of this, escaped to Offa, king 
of the Mercians. While Offa concealed bun with anxioos- 
eare, the messengers of Bertric arrived, demanding the 
fb^tive fc^ ponishment, and offering money for his snr- 
render. In addition to this they solictted bis daughter in 
marriage for their king, in order that the nuptial tie might 
bind them in perpetual amity. In consequence Offa, who 
would not give way to hostile threats, yielded to flattering 
aflnrements, and Egbert, passing the sea, went into France ; 
a circnmstaace which I attribute to the counsels of God, that 
a man destined to rule so great a kingdom might learn the 
art of government from the Franks ; for this people has no 
eompetiftor among all the Western nations in miUtary skill 
or polished manners. This ill-treatment Egbert used as an 
inoentive to ^ rub off the rust of indolence,'' to quicken the 
eneigy of his mind, and to ad^^t foreign customs, fiv 
differing from his native barbarism. On tiie death, therefore, 
of Bertie, being invited into Britain by frequent messages 
from his friends, he ascended the throne, and realized the 
fondest expectations of his country. He was crowned in the 
year of our Lord's incarnation 800, and in the thirty-fourth 
year of the reign of Charles the Great, of France, who 
survived this event twelve years. In the meuitine Egbert^ 
when he had acquired the regard of his sulgects by his 
aflability and kindness, first manifested his power against 
those Britons who inhiUnt that part of the island which is 
called ComwaH, and having subjugated them, he proeeeded 
to m^Efi the NArthem Britons,* who are separated from the 
otiieiB by an arm of the sea, tributary to him. While the 
fome of these victories struck terror into the rest, Bemulf 
king of the Mercians^ aiming at sometiiing great, and 
supposing it would redound to his glory if he could remove 
Ihe terror of others by his own audacity, proclaimed war

against Egbert. Deeming it disgraceful to retreat, Egbert 
met him with much spirit, and on then coming into action, 
Bemulf was defeated and fled. This battle took place at 
Hellendun, a.d. 824.* Elated with this success, the West 
Saxon king, extending his views, in the heat of victory, aent 
his son Ethelwuli^ with Alstan, bishop of Sherborne, and a 
chosen band, into Kent, for the purpose of adding to the 
West Saxon dominions that province, which had either 
grown indolent through long repose, or was terrified hy the 
fame of his valour. These commanders observed thdr 
instructions effectuallj, for they passed through eveiy part 
of the country, and driving Baldred its king, with litde 
difficulty, beyond the river Thames, they subjugated to his 
dominion, in the twenty-fourth year of his reign, Kent, 
Surrey, the South Saxons, and the East Saxons, who had 
formerly been under the jurisdiction of his predecessors. 
Not long after the East Angles, animated by the support of 
Egbert, killed by successive stratagems, Bemulf and 
Ludecan, kings of the Mercians. The cause of thw 
destruction was, their perpetual incursions, with their usual 
insolence, on the territories of others. Withlaf their 
successor, first driven from his kingdom by Egbert^ and 
afterwards admitted as a tributary prince, augmented the 
West Saxon soverdgniy. In the same year the Northum- 
brians perceiving that themselves only remained and were a 
conspicuous object, and fearing lest he should pour out his 
long-cherished anger, on them, at last, though late, gave 
hostages, and yielded to his power. When he was thus 
possessed of all Britain, the rest of his life, a space of nine 
years, passed quietly on, except that, nearly in his latter days^ 
a piratical band of Danes made a descent, and disturbed ihe 
peaqe of the kingdom. So changeable is the lot of hnman 
affairs, that he, who first singly governed all the Angles, 
could derive but little satisfaction from the obedience of his 
countrymen, for a foreign enemy was perpetually

of the Angles made a standi but fortune no longer flattered 
the king with her customary favours, hut deserted him in the 
contest : for, when, during the greater part of the daj, he 
had ahnost secured the victory, he lost the battle as the sun 
declined ; however, by the favour of darkness, he escaped 
the disgrace of being conquered. In the next action, with a 
small forc^ he totally routed an immense multitude. At 
length, after a reign of thirty-seven years and seven months, 
he departed this life, and was buried at Winchester ; leaving 
an ample field of glory for his son, and declaring, that he 
muHt be happy, if he was careful not to destroy, by the 
indolence natural to his race, a kingdom that himself had 
consolidated with such consummate industry.

OS Inng Ethelioulf. [a.d. 839—858.] 

Ik the year of our Lord's incarnation 837,* Ethelwul^ whom 
some cfdl Athulf^ ihe son of Egbert, came to the throne, and 
reigned twenty years and five months. Mild by nature he 
in&iitely prefeired a life of tranquillity to dominion over 
many provinces ; and, finally, content with his paternal 
kingdom, he bestowed all the rest^ which his father had sub- 
jugated, on his son Ethelstan ; of whom it is not known 
when, or in what manner, he died. He assisted Burhred, 
king of the Mercians, with an army against the Biitons, and 
highly exalted him by giving him his daughter in marriage. 
He frequently overcame the piratical Danes, who were tra- 
versing the whole island and infesting the coast with sudden 
descents, both personally and by his generals ; although, 
according to the chance of war, he himself experienced 
great and repeated calamities ; London and almost the whole 
of SJent being laid waste. Yet these disasters were ever 
checked by the alacrity of the king's advisers, who suffered 
not the enemy to trespass with impunity, but fully avenged 
theuLselves on them by the effect of their united counsels. 
For he possessed at that time, two most excellent prelates, 

* Malmeshuiy, in following the Saxon Chronicle, is two yeen earlier 
than the Northern Guonicles.

St. Swithun of Winch^ter, and Ealstan of Sherborne, who 
perceiving the king to be of heavy and sluggish dispositiony 
perpetually stimulated him, by their admonitions, to the 
knowledge of governing. Swithun, disgusted with earthly, 
trained j^ master to heavenly pursuits ; Ealstan, knowing 
that the business of the kingdom ought not to be neglected, 
Gontinually inspirited him against the Danes : himself fur- 
nishing the exchequer with money, as well as regulating the 
army. Any peruser of the Annals* will find many affairs 
of this kind, both entered on with courage, and terminated 
with success through his means. He held his bishopric 
fifty years ; happy in living for so long a space in the prac- 
tice of good works. I should readily commend him, had he 
not been swayed by worldly avarice, and usurped what be- 
longed to others, when by his intrigues he seized the monas- 
tery of Malmesbury for his own use. We feel the mischief 
of this shameful conduct even to the present day, although 
the monastery has baffled all similar violence from the time 
of his death till now, when it has fallen again into like diffi- 
culty.f Thus the accursed passion of avarice corrupts the 
human soul, and forces men, though great and illustrious 
in other respects, into hell. 

Ethelwulf, confiding in these two supporters, provided 
effectually for external emergencies, and did not neglect the 
interior concerns of his kingdom. For after the subjugation 
of his enemies, turning to the establishm^it of God's wor- 
ship, he granted every tenth hide of land within his king- 
dom to the servants of Christ, free from all tribute, exempt 
from all services. But how small a portion is this of his 
glory ? Having settled his kingdom, he went to Rome, and 
there offered to St. Peter that tribute which England pays to 
this day,f before pope Leo the fourth, who had also, formerly,

obscure : Higden interpolates Malmesbury, as assigning its first grant to 
Ina : Henry of Huntingdon says, OiFa. This grant is supposed by Spel- 
man to have been made in a General Council of the nation. A nmilar 
payment appears to have been made by other nations. It is to be observed 
that Asser mentions only Ethelwulf 's donation of three hundred mancuses.

honoarablj received, and anointed as king, Alfred,* his son, 
whom Ethelwulf had sent to him. Continuing there a whole 
jear, he nobly repaired the School of the Angles, which, 
according to report, was first founded by Offa, king of the 
Mercians, and had been burned down the preceding year.^ 
Betuming home through France, he married Judith, daugh- 
ter of Charles, king of the Franks. 



OF THE SUCCESSORS OF CHARLWWAGNE. 

For Louis the Pious, son of Charles the Great, had four 
sons; Lothaire, Pepin, Louis, and Charles, sumamed the 
Bald ; of these Lothaire, even in his father's life-time, 
Qsorping the title of emperor, reigned fifteen years in that 
part of Grermany situated near the Alps which is now called 
Lorraine, that is, the kingdom of Lothaire, and in all Italy 
together with Rome. In his latter days, afflicted with sick- 
ness, he renounced the world. He was a man by far more 
inhuman than all who preceded him ; so much so, as even 
frequently to load his own father with chains in a dungeon. 
Louis indeed was of mild and simple manners, but he was 
nnmerdfuUy persecuted by Lothaire, because Ermengarda, 
hy whom he had his first family, being dead, he was doat- 
ingly fond of Charles, his son by his second wife Judith. 

* Aaer relates that pope Leo ttood sponsor for, and confirmed Alfred, 
who had been sent to Rome by his father the preceding year. 

f The conflagration here named seems that mentioned by Anastasus, 
who tells ns, that, shortly after the accession of Pope Leo the fourth, a 
fire broke ont in the Saxon street, but the pope, making the sign of the 
otMB with hia fingers, put a stop to it. (Anastas. Biblioth. p. 319.) From 
this author's account it appears to have been a street or quarter of con- 
Bderable extent, and near to St. Peterl There were schools of this kind 
bdongmg to various nations at Rome. Matt. Westminster says it was 
founded by Ina, with the consent and approbation of Pope Gregory, that 
pnests, nobles, prelates, or kings, of the £nglish nation, might be enter- 
bused there during their stay for the purpose of being thoroughly instructed 
in the Catholic fiuth ; for that, from the time of Augustine, the doctrine and 
ichools of the English had been interdicted by the popes on account of the 
Taiious heresies w^ch had sprung up among them ; that, moreover, Ina be- 
rtowed a penny from each house, or Rome-scot, for the support of these 
penons. (Matt, West. a.d. 727.) It was destroyed by iire in the year 
816, and partially again a.d. 854. Our text, therefore, is at variance with 
the account given by Anastauus, and the latter is probably incorrect.

Pepin, lusotEor son of Louis, had dominion in Aquitaine*

to Norica, which tie had already, possessed the kingdoms 
which his father had given him, that is to saj, Alemannia, 
Thuringia, Austrasia, Saxony, and the kingdom of the 
Ayares, that is, the Huns. Charles obtained the half oi 
France on the west, and all Neustria, Brittanj, and the 
greatest part of Burgundj, Gothia, Gasconj, and Aquitaine, 
Pepin the son of Pepin being ejected thence and compelled 
to become a monk in the monastery of Sl Methard ; who 
afterwards escaping by flight, and returning into Aquitaine, 
remained there in concealment a long time ; bat b^ng again 
treacherously deceived by Ranulph the governor, he waa 
seized, brought to Charles at Senlis, and doomed to perpetoal 
exile. Moreover, after the death of the most pions emperor, 
Louis, Lothaire, who had been anointed emperor eighteen 
years before his father's decease, being joined by Pepin with 
the people of Aquitaine, led an army against his brothera, 
that is, Louis, the most pious king of the Bavarians, and 
Charles, into the county of Auxerre to a place called Fonte^ 
nai :f where, when the Franks with all their sulject natiooa 
had been overwhelmed by mutual slaughter, Louis and 
Charles ultimately triumphed ; Lotluure being put to flight. 
After this most sanguinary conflict, however, peace was 
made between them, and they divided the sovereignty of the 
Franks, as has been mentioned above. Lothaire had three 
sons by Ermengarda the daughter of Hugo : first, Louis, to 
whom he committed the government of the Romans and of 
Italy ; next, Lothaire, to whom he left the imperial crown ; 
lastly, Charles, to whom he gave Provence. Lothaire died

tHrty-tMrd. Charles Us son, who governed Provence, sui*- 
▼ired him eieht years, and then Louis, emperor of the Ro- 
mans, and Lothaire his brother, shared his kingdom of 
Proretice. But Louis king of the Norici, that is, of the 
Bavarians, the son of Louis the emperor, in the year of our 
Lord's incarnation 865, after the feast of Caster, divided his 
kingdom between his sons. To Caroloman he gave Norica, 
that is, Bavaria, and the marches bordering on the Sclavo- 
mans and the Lombards ; to Louis, Thuringia, the Eastern 
Franks, and Saxony; to Charles he lef^ Alemonnia, and 
Comwalla^that is, the county of Cornwall.* Louis him- 
self teigned happily over his sons, in full power for ten 
jears, and then died in the year of our Lord's incarnation 
878, when he had reigned fifty-four years. Charles king of 
the West Franks, in the thirty-sixth year of his reign, enter- 
ing Italy, came to offer up his prayers in the church of the 
apostles, and was there elected emperor by all the Roman 
people, and consecrated by pope Jolm on the 25th of Decem- 
ber, in the year of our Lord's incarnation 875. Thence he 
had a prosperous return into Gaul. But in the thirty-eighth 
jear of his reign, and the beginning of the third of his im- 
perial dignity, he went into Italy again, and held a conference 
with pope John ; and returning into Gaul, he died, after 
passing Mount Cenis, on the Idth of October, in the tenth 
of the Indicdon, in the year of our Lord 877, and was suc- 
ceeded by his son Louis. Before the second year of his 
reign was completed this Louis died in the palace at Com- 
peigne, on the sixth before the Ides of April, in the year of 
our Lord 879, the twelfth of the Indiction. After him his 
wns, Louis and Caroloman, divided his kingdom. Of these, 
loais gained a victory over the Normans in the district of 
Vimett, and died soon after on the 12th of August, in the 
year of our Lord 881, the fifteenth of the Indiction, having 
i^eigned two years, three months, and twenty-four days. He 
Was succeeded in his government by his brother Caroloman, 
who, after reigning three years and six days, was wounded

He departed this life in the year of our Lord 884, the seoond 
of the Indiction, the 24th of December. Next Charles king 
of the Suavi, the son of Louis king of the Norici, assumed 
the joint empire of the Franks and Romans, in the jear of 
the Licamate Word 885, the third of the Indiction ; whose 
vision, as I think it worth preserving, I here subjoin : 

" In the name of God most high, the King of kings. As 
I, Charles by the free gift of God, emperor, king of the Grer- 
mans, patrician of the Romans, and emperor of the Franks, 
on the sacred night of the Lord's day, after duly performing 
the holy service of the evening, went to the bed of rest and 
sought the sleep of quietude, there came a tremendous voice 
to me, saying, * Charles, thy spirit shall shortly depart from 
thee for a considerable time :' immediately I was rapt in the 
spirit, and he who carried me away in the spirit was most 
glorious to behold. Li hia hand he held a clue of thread 
emitting a beam of purest light, such as comets shed when 
they appear. This he began to unwind, and said to me, * Take 
the thread of this briUiant clue and bind and tie it firmly on 
the thumb of thy right hand, for thou shalt be led by it 
through the inextricable punishments of the infernal r^ons.' 
Saying this, he went before me, quickly unrolling the thread 
of the brilliant clue, and led me into very deep and fiery 
valleys which were full of pits boiling with pitcl^ and brim- 
stone, and lead, and wax, and grease. There I found the 
bishops of my fkther and of my uncles : and when in terror 
I asked them why they were suffering such dreadful tor- 
ments ? they replied, * We were the bishops of 3rour father 
and of your uncles, and instead of preachii^, and admonish- 
ing them and their people to peace and concord, as was our 
duty, we were the sowers of discord and the fomenters of 
evil. On this account we are now burning in these infernal 
torments, together with other lovers of slaughter and of 
rapine ; and hither also will your bishops and ministers come, 
who now delight to act as we did.' While I was fearfully 
listening to this, behold the blackest demons came fiying 
about me, with fiery claws endeavouring to snatch away the 
thread of life which I held in my hand, and to draw it to 
them ; but repelled by the rays of the clue, they were unable 

screen him from pwuahmeDt* Malmesbuzy, however, foUowi Aasa, the

to touch it Next roiming behind me, they tried to gripe 
me in their claws and cast me headlong into thoae sulphu- 
reous jnts : but mj conductor, who carried the clue, threw a 
thread of light over mj shoulders, and doubling it, drew me 
stronglj after him, and in this manner we ascended lofty 
fiery mountains, from which arose lakes, and burning rivers, 
and all kinds of burning metals, wherein I found immersed 
innomerable souls of the vassals and princes of my father 
and brothers, some up to the hair, others to the chin, and 
otiiers to the middle, who mournfully cried out to me, ' While 
we were living, we were, together with yon, and your father, 
and brothers, and uncles, fond of battle, and slaughter, and 
plunder, through lust of earthly things : wherefore we now 
undergo punishment in these boiling rivers, and in various 
kinds of liquid metaL' While I was, with the greatest 
alarm, attending to these, I heard some souls behind me cry- 
ing out, ' The great will undergo still greater torment.' I 
Idoked back and beheld on the banks of the boiling river, 
fomaoes of pitch and brimstone, filled with great dragons^ 
and scorpions, and different kinds of serpents, where I also 
saw some of my father's nobles, some of my own, and of 
those of my brothers and of my uncles, who said, ^ Alas, 
Charles, you see what dreadful torments we undergo on 
account of our malice, and pride, and the evil counsel which 
we gave to our kings and to you, for lust's sake.' When I 
eould not help groaning mournfully at this, the dragons ran 
at me with open jaws fiUed with fire, and brimstone, and 
pitch, and tried to swallow me up. My conductor then 
tripled the thread of the clue around me, which by the 
splendour of its rays overcame their fiery throats : he then 
pulled me with greater violence, and we descended into a 
valley, which was in one part dark and burning like a fiery 
fomaoe, but in another so extremely enchanting and glorious, 
that I cannot describe it I tum^ myself to the dark part 
which emitted flames, and there I saw some kings of my race 
in extreme torture ; at which, affrighted beyond measure and 
reduced to great distress, I expected that I should be imme. 
diately thrown into these torments by some very black giants, 
who made the valley blaze with every kind of flame. I trem- 
bled very much, and, the thread of the clue of light assisting 
my eyes, I saw, on the side of the valley, the light somewhat

lyrtghtening, and two foHntains flowing oat thenoe : one was 
extremelj liot ; the other clear and luke-warm ; two lai^ge 
casks wei« there besides. When, guided hj the thread of 
fight, I proceeded thither, I looked into the vessel containing 
boiling water, and saw mj fieither Loois^ standing therein np to 
his thighs. He was dreadfallj oppressed with pain and agonj, 
and said to me, ' Fear not, mj lord Chu'Ies ; I know tiiat jour 
spirit will again return into jour body, and thai Grod hath 
permitted you to come hithor, that jou nnght see for what 
crimes myself and all whom you hare beheld, undergo tiiese 
torments. One day I am boUied in the boiling cask ; next I 
pass into that other delightful water j whJ<^ is effected hj 
the prayers of St. Pet^ and Sc Remigius, under whose pa- 
tronage our royal race has hitherto reigned. But if you^ and 
my faithful bishops and abbats^ and ^ whole ecclesiastical 
order wifl quickly assist me with masses, prayers and psalms^ 
and alms^ and vigils, I shall Portly be released from the 
punishment of the boiling water. For my brother Lothaire 
and fads son Louis have had these punishments remitted by 
the prayers of 8t. Peter and St^ Remigius, and have now 
entered into the joy of Gkni's paradise.' He then said to me^ 
' Look on your left hand f and when I had done scy I saw 
two very deep casks boiling fiiriously. ' These,' said he, 
* are prepared for you, if you do not amend and repent of 
your atrocious crimes.' I then began to be dreadfully afraid, 
and when my conductCMr saw my spirit thus terrified, he said 
to me, 'Follow me to the right of that most resplendent 
valley of paradisei.'' As we proceeded, I beteld my uncle 
Lothaire ntting in excessive brightness, in company with 
glorious kings, on a topaz-stone of uncommon sise, crowned 
with a precious diadem : and near him, his son Louis crowned 
in like manner. Seeing me near at hand he called me to 
bim in a kind voice, saying, * Come to me, Charles, now my 
third successor in the empire of the Bomans ; I know that 
you have passed through the place of punishment where your 
father, my brother, is placed in the baths appointed for him ; 
but, by the mercy of Grod, he will be shortly liberated from 
those punishments as we have been, by the merits of Si 
Peter and the prayers of St. Remigius, to whom Gk>d hath 
given a special charge over the kings and people of the 
Franks, and unless he shall continue to favour and assist the

dregs of oar family, our race must shortly ceas^ both irom 
the kmgd<»n and the empire. Know, moreorer, ^at the rule 
of the empire will be shortly taken out of your hand, nof 
win you long surriva Then JLouis turning to me, said, * The 
empire which you hare hitherto held by hereditary right, 
Louis the son of my daughter is to assume.' So saying, 
there seemed immediately to appear before me a little child, 
and Lotbaire his grandfather looking upon him, said to me, 
* This infant seems to be such an one as that which the Lord 
set in the midst of the disciples, and said, *' Of such is the 
kingdom of God, I say unto you, that their angels do always 
behold the face of my father who is in heathen." But do you 
bestow on him the empire by that thread of the clue which 
you hold in your hand. I then untied the thread from the 
thumb of my right hand, and gaVe him the whole monarchy 
of the empire by that thread, and immediately the entire 
due, like a briUiant sun-beam, became rolled up in his hand. 
Thus, after this wonderful transaction, my spirit, extremely 
wearied and affrighted, returned into my body. Therefore, 
let all persons know willingly or unwillingly, forasmuch as, 
acoor^ng to the will of God, the whole empire of the Romans 
will reTert into his hands, and that I cannot preyail against 
Mm, compelled by the conditions of this my caUing, that God, 
who is the ruler of the living and the dead, wiU both com- 
plete and establish this ; whose eternal kingdom remains for 
ever and ever, amen.** 

The vision itself, and the partition of the kingdoms, I have 
inserted in the very words I found them in.* This Charles^ 
then, had scarcely discharged the united duties of the empire 
and kingdom for two years, when Charles, the son of Louis 
who died at Compeigne, succeeded him : this is the Charles 
who married the daughter of Edward, king of England, and 
gave Normandy to Hollo with his daughter Gisla, who was 
the surety of peace and pledge of the treaty. To this 
Charles, in the empire^ succeeded Amulph ; a king of the 
imperial Hne, tutor of that young Louis of whom the vision 
above recited speaks. Amulph dying after fifteen years, this 
Louis succeeded him, at whose death, one Conrad^ king of the

TeutonianB, obtained the soyereigiily. BSs son Heniy, who 
succeeded Idm, sent to Athelstan kmg of the Angles, for his 
two sisters, Aldgitha and Edgitha, the latter of whom he 
married to his son Otho, the former to a certain duke near 
the Alps. Thus the empire of the Romans' and the kingdom 
<^ the Franks being severed firom their ancient union, the 
one is governed by emperors and the other by kings. But 
as I have wandered wide from mj purpose, whilst indulging 
in tracing the descent of the illustrious kings of the Franks, 
I will now return to the course I had begun, and to Ethel- 
wulf. 

On his return after his yearns peregrination and marriage 
with the daughter of Charles the Bsdd, as I have said, he 
found the dispositions of some persons contrary to his ex- 
pectations. For Ethelbald his son, and Ealstan bishop of 
Sherborne, and Enulph earl of Somerset conspiring against 
him, endeavoured to eject him from the soverdgnty; but 
through the intervention of maturer counsel, the kingdom 
was divided between the father and his son. This partition 
was extremely unequal ; for malignity was so far successful 
that the western portion, which was the better, was allotted 
to the son, the eastern, which was the worse, fell to the 
father. He, however, with incredible forbearance, dreading 
"a worse than civil war," calmly gave way to his son, re- 
straining, by a conciliatory harangue, the people who had 
assembled for the purpose of asserting his dignity. And 
though all this quarrel arose on account of his foreign wife, 
yet he held her in the highest estimation, and used to place 
her on the throne near himself contrary to the West Saxon 
custom. For that people never suffered the king's consort 
either to be seated by the king or to be honoured with the 
appellation of queen, on account of the depravity of Ead- 
burga, daughter of Offa, king of the Mercians ; who, as we 
have before mentioned, being married to Bertric, king of the 
West Saxons, used to persuade him, a tender-hearted man, 
as they report, to the destruction of the innocent, and would 
herself take off by poison those against whom her accusa- 
tions failed. This was exemplified in the case of a youth 
much beloved by the king, whom she made away with in 
this manner: and immediately afterwards Bertric fell sick, 
wasted away and died, from having previously drunk of the 



^ik8S7.] STHBLWULV^ chabteb. 107 

same potion, unknown to the queen. The rumour of this 
getting abroad, drove the poisoner from the kingdom. Pro- 
ceeding to Charles the Great, she happened to find him 
standing with one of his sons, and aft^ offering him pre- 
sents, the emperor, in a phiyfol, jocose manner, commanded 
her to choose which she liked best, himself, or his son. 
Eadburga choosing the joung man for his blooming beautj, 
Charles replied with some emotion, ''Had jovl chosen me, 
joa should have had mj son, but since jou have chosen him, 
jou shall have neither." He then placed her in a monastery 
where she might pass her life in splendour ; but, soon after, 
finding her Ruiltv of incontinence he expelled her.* Struck 
witTL. ii,^^ of depravity, the SaS^s fr«ned the regu- 
laticm I have alluded to, though Ethelwulf invalidated it by 
his affectionate kindness. He made his will a few months 
before he died, in which, after the division of the kingdom 
between his sons Ethelbald and Ethelbert, he set out the 
dowry of his daughter, and ordered, that, till the end of 
time, one poor person should be clothed and fed from every 
tenth hide of his inheritance, and that every year, three 
hundred mancas of goldf should be sent to Rome, of which 
one-third should be given to St. Peter, another to St. Paul 
for lamps, and the other to the pope for distribution. He 
died two years after he came from Rome, and was buried at 
Winchester in the cathedral. But that I may return from 
my digression to my proposed series, I shall here subjoin the 
charter of ecclesiastical immunities which he granted to all 
England.

we perceive that perilous times are pressing on us, that

sins; for the king while living, they shall say, *Let us 
pray: O God, whojustifiest.* For the nobility while living, 
* Stretch forth, O Lord.* After they are dead ; for the de-

In the year of our Lord 857, f the two sons of £thelwulf 
dirided their paternal kingdom ; Ethelbald reigned in West 
Saxony, and Ethelbert in Kent. Ethelbald, base and per- 
fidious, defiled the bed of his father by marrying, after his 
decease, Judith his step-mother. Dying, however, at the 
end of five years, and bemg interred at Sherborne, the whole 
government devolved upon his brother. In his time a band 
of pirates landing at Southampton, proceeded to plimder the 
populous city of Winchester, but soon after being spiritedly 
repulsed by the king's generals, and suffering considerable 
loss, they put to sea, and coasting round, chose the Isle of 
Thanet, in Kent, for their winter quarters. The people of 
Kent, giving hostages, and promising a sum of money, would 
have remained quiet, had not these pirates, brealung the 
treaty, laid waste the whole district by nightly predatory 
excursions, but roused by this conduct they mustered a force 
and drove out the truce-breakers. Moreover Ethelbert, 
having ruled the kingdom with vigour and with mildness,

paid the debt of nature after five Team^ and was buried at 
Sherborne. 

In the jear of our Lord 867, Ethelred, the son of Ethd- 
wulf, obtained his paternal kingdom, and ruled it for the 
same nmnber of years as his brothers. Surely it would be a 
pitiable and grievous destiny, that all of them should perish 
by an early death, unless it is, that in such a tempest of 
evils, these royal youths should prefer an honourable end to 
a painful government. Indeed, so bravely and so vigorously 
did they contend for their country, that it was not to be im>- 
puted to them that their valour did not succeed in its -design. 
Finally, it is related, that this king was personally engaged 
in hostile conflict against the enemy nine times in one year, 
with various success indeed, but for the most part victor, 
besides sudden attacks, in which, from his skill in warfare, 
he frequently worsted those straggling depredators. In these 
several actions the Danes lost nine earls and one king, be- 
sides conmion people innumerable. 

One battle memorable beyond all the rest was that which 
took place at Eschendun. * The Danes, having collected an 
army at this place, divided it into two bodies ; their two 
kings commanded the one, all their earls the other. Ethelred 
drew near with his brother Alfred. It fell to the lot of 
Ethelred to oppose the kings, while Alfred was to attack the 
earls. Both armies eagerly prepared for battle, but night 
approaching deferred the conflict tiU the ensuing day. 
Scarcely had the morning dawned ere Alfred was ready at 
his post, but his brother, intent on his devotions, had re- 
mained in his tent ; and when urged on by a message, that 
the pagans were rushing forward with unbounded fury, he 
declared that he should not move a step till his religious ser- 
vices were ended. This piety of the king was of infinite 
advantage to his brother, who was too impetuous from the 
thoughtlessness of youth, and had already far advanced. 
The battalions of the Angles were now giving way, and 
even bordering on flight, hi consequence of their adversaries

king himself signed with the cross of God, unexpectedlj 
hastened forward, dispersing the enemy, and rallying his 
subjects. The Danes, terrified equally by his courage and 
the divine manifestation, consulted their safety by flight. 
Here fell Oseg their king, Ave earls, and an innumerable 
multitude of common people. 

The reader will be careful to observe that during this 
time, the kings of the Mercians and of the NorthumbriaBS, 
eagerly seizing the opportunity of the arrival of the Danes, 
with whom Ethelred was fully occupied in fighting, and 
somewhat relieved from their bondage to the West Saxons, 
bad nearly regained their original power. All the provinces, 
therefore, were laid waste by cruel depredations, because 
each king chose rather to resist the enemy within his own 
territories, than to assist his neighbours in their diflculties ; 
and thus preferring to avenge injury rather than to prevent 
it, they ruined their country by their senseless conduct. The 
Danes acquired strength without impediment, whilst the 
i^prehensions of the inhabitants increased, and each suc- 
cessive victory, from the addition of captives, became the 
means of obtaining another. The country of the £ast 
Angles, together with their cities and villages, was possessed 
by these plunderers ; its king, St. Edmund, slain by them in 
the year of our Lord's incarnation 870, on the tenth of 
November, purchased an eternal kingdom by putting off this 
mortal life. The Mercians, often harassed, alleviated their 
afiiictions by giving hostages. The Northumbrians, long 
embroiled in civil dissensions, made up their differences on 
the approach of the enemy. Replacing Osbert their king, 
whom they had expelled, upon the throne, and collecting a 
powerful force, they went out to meet the foe ; but being 
easily repelled, they shut themsdves up in the city of York, 
which was presently after set on fire by the victors ; and 
when the flames were raging to the utmost and consaming 
the very walls, they perished for their country in the 
conflagration. In this manner Northumbrian the prize of 
war, fbr a considerable time after, felt the more bitterly, 
through a sense of former liberty, the galling yoke of the 
barbarians. And now Ethelred, worn down with numberless 
labours, died and was buried at Wimbome.

CHAP. IV, 

Of Icing Alfred, (i,d. 87^— 901.] 

br the year of oar Lord's mcamation 872, Alfred, the 
joungest son of Ethelwulf^ who had, as has been related 
before^ received the royal unction and erown from pope Leo 
tiie fourth at Bome^ acceded to the sovereignty and retained 
It with the greatest difficulty, but with equal valour, twenty- 
eight years and a half. To trace in detail the maaey labyrinth 
of his labours was never my design ; because a recapitulation 
of his exploits in their exact order of time would occasion 
aome concision to the reader. For, to relate how a hostile 
army, driven by himself or his generals, from one part of a 
distrid^ retreated to another ; and, dislodged thence, sought 
a fresh scene of operation and filled every place with rapine 
and slaughter ; and, if I may use the expression, " to go 
round liie whole idand with Mm," might to some seem the 
height of folly : consequently I shall touch on all points 
sommarily. For nine successive years battling with his 
eaenues, sometimes deceived by false treaties, and sometimes 
wreaking his vengeance on the deceivers, he was at last 
reduced to such extreme distress, that scarcely three 
counties, that is to say, Hampshire, Wiltshire, and Somer- 
setshire, stood feist by their allegiance, as he was compelled 
to retreat to a c^tain island called Athelney, which frx>m its 
marshy situation was hardly accessible. He was accustomed 
afterwards, when in happier circumstances, to relate to his 
companions, in a livdy and agreeable manner, his perils 
there, and how he escaped them by the merits of St 
Cuthbert ; * for it frequently happens that men are pleased 
with the recollection of those circumstances, which formerly 
fiyey dreaded to encounter. During his retreat in this island, 
as he was one day in the house alone, his companions being 
diqpersed on the river side for the purpose of fishing, ha 
endeavoured to refr-esh his weary frame with sleep : and 
behold I Cuthbert, formerly bishop of Lindijsfame, addressed

him, while sleepiiigy in the following manner: — ^'^I am 
Guthbert, if ever 70U heard of me ; God hath sent me to 
announce good fortune to jou ; and since England has 
already largelj paid the penalty of her crimes, Grod now, 
through the merits of her native saints, looks upon her with 
an eye of mercy. You too^ so pitiably banished from your 
Idngdom, shall shortly be again seated with honour on your 
throne ; of which I give you this extraordinary token : your 
fishers shall this day bring home a great quantity of large 
fish in baskets ; which will be so much the more ex- 
traordinary because the river, at this time hard-bound with ice, - 
could warrant no such expectation ; especially as the air now 
dripping with cold rain mocks the art of the fisher. But, 
when your fortune shall succeed to your wishes, you will act 
as becomes a king, if you conciliate God your helper, and 
me his messenger, with suitable devotion." Saying thus^ 
the saint divested the sleeping king of his anxiety ; and 
comforted his mother also, who was lying near hun, and 
endeavouring to invite some gentie slumbers to her hard 
couch to relieve her cares, with the same joyful intelligence. 
When they awoke, they repeatedly declared that each had 
had the self-same dream, when the fishermen entering, 
displayed such a multitude of fishes as would have he&i 
sufficient to satisfy the appetite of a numerous army. 

Not long after, venturing from his concealment, he 
hazarded an experiment of consummate art. Accompanied 
only by one of his most faithful adherents, he entered the 
tent of the Danish king under the disguise of a minstrel ; * 
and being admitted, as a professor of the mimic art, to the 
banqueting room, there was no object of secrecy that he did 
not minutdy attend to both with eyes and ears. Remaining 
there several days, till he had satisfied his mind on every 
matter which he wished to know, he returned to Athdney : 
and assembling his oxnpanions, pointed out the indolence of 
the enemy and the easiness of their defeat. AU were eager 
tor the enterprise, and himself collecting forces firom every 
side, and learning exactiy the situation of the barbarians 
from scouts he had sent out for that purpose, he suddenly 
attacked and routed them with incredible slaughter. The

remainder, with their king, gave hostages that they would 
eoAfnce Christiamtj and depart from the country ; which 
they performed. For their king, Grothrun, whom our people 
call Gurmund, with thirty nobles and ahmost all the com* 
monalty, was baptized, Alfired standing for him ; and the 
provinces of the East Angles, and Northumbrians* were 
giren up to him, in order that he might, under fealty to the 
king, protect with hereditary right, what before he had over- 
ran with predatory incursion. However, as the Ethiopian 
cannot change his skin, he domineered over these tributary 
provinces with the haughtiness of a tyrant for eleven years, 
and died in the twelfth, transmitting to his posterity the inhe- 
ritance of his disloyalty, until subdued by Athelstan, the 
grandson of Alfred, they were^ though reluctantly, compelled 
to admit one conmion king of England, as we see at the pre- 
sent day. Such of the Danes as had refused to become 
Christians, together with Hastings, went over sea, where the 
inhabitants are best able to tell what cruelties they perpe- 
trated. For overrunning the whole maritime coasts to tho 
Tuscan sea, they unpeopled Paris and Tours, as well as 
many other cities seated on the Seine and Loire, those noted 
rivers of France. At that time the bodies of many saints 
being taken up firom the spot of their original interment and 
omveyed to safer places, have ennobled foreign churches with 
their rdics even to this day. Then also the body of St. 
Martin, venerated, as Sidonius says, over the whole earth, in 
which virtne resides though life be at an end, was taken to 
Aozerre, by the clergy of his church, and placed in that of 
St German, where it astonished the people of that district 
by unheardHKf miracles. And when they who came thither, 
oat of gratitude for cures performed, contributed many things 
to requite the labours of those who had borne him to this 
ehnrch, as is commonly the case, a dispute arose about the 
division of the money ; the Turonians claiming the whole, 
because their patron had called the contributors together by 
his miracles : the natives, on the other hand, alleging that 
St German was not unequal in merits and was of equal

kindnesa ; that both indeed had the same power, bat that 
the prerogative of their church preponderated. To solve 
thiB knottj doubt, a leprous person was sought^ and placed, 
nearly at the last gasp, wasted to a skeleton, and already 
dead, as it were, in a living carcass, between the bodies of 
the two saints. All human watch was prohibited for the 
whole night : the glory of Martin alone was vigilant ; 
for the next day, the skin of the man on his side appeared 
clear, while on that of Grerman, it was disooloared with its 
customary deformity. And, that they might not attribute 
this miracle to diance, they turned the yet ^seesed side to 
Martin. As soon as the morning began to dawn, the man 
was found by the hastening attendants with his skin smooth, 
perfectly cured, declaring the kind condescension of the 
resident patron, who yielded to the honour of su<^ a wel- 
come stranger. Thus the Turonians, both at that time and 
afiierwards, safely filled their common purse by the assistanee 
of their patron, till a more favourable gale of peace restored 
them to their former residence. For these marauders infest* 
ing France for thirteen years, and being at last overcome bj 
the emperor Emulph and the people of Brittany in many 
encounters, retreated into England as a convenient receptacle 
for their tyranny. During this space of time Alfred had re- 
duced the whole island to his power, with the exception of 
what the Danes possessed* The Angles had willingly sur- 
rendered to his dominion, r^oicing tlmt they had produced a 
man capable of leading them to liberty. He granted Lon- 
don, the chief city of the Mercian kingdom, to a nobleman 
named Ethered, to hold in fealty, and gave him his daughter 
Ethelfied in marriage. Ethered conducted himself with 
equal valour and fidelity ; defended his trust with activity, 
and kept the East Angles and Northumbrians, who were 
fomenting rebellion against the king, within due bounds, 
compelling them to give hostages. Of what infinite service 
this was, the following em^^ency proved. After Enghuid 
had rejoiced for thirteen years in the tranquillity of peace 
and in the fertility of her soil, the northern pest of barba- 
rians again returned. With them returned war and slaugh- 
ter ; again arose conspiracies of the Northumbrians and East 
Angles: but neither strangers nor natives eiqperienoed the 
same fortune as in former years ; the one party, diminished

bj forogn contests, were less slert in their invasions ; while 
the other, now experienced in war and animated hj the ex- 
hortations of the king, were not onlj more ready to resist^ 
bat also to attack. The king himself was, with his usual 
aetiTitj, present in every action, ever daunting the invaders, 
and at the same time inspiriting his suhjects, with the signal 
display of his courage. He would oppose himself singly to 
the enemy ; and hy his own personal exertions rally his de- 
clining forces. The very places are yet pointed oat by the 
inhabitants where he felt the vicissitudes of good and evil 
fortnne. It was necessary to contend with Alfred even after 
he was overcome, after he was prostrate; insomuch that 
when he might be supposed altogether vanquished, he would 
escape Hke a sUppenr serpent, from the hand which held 
biniy glide from his lurking-place, and, with undiminished 
eounige, spring on his insulting enemies : he was insupport- 
Mb after flight, and became more circumspect from the re- 
collection of defeat, more bold from the thirst of vengeance. 
His children by Elswitha, the daughter of earl Athelred, 
were Ethelswitha, Edward who reigned after him; Ethel- 
M who was married to Ethered earl of the Mercians ; 
Ethdwerd, whom they celebrate as being extremely learned ; 
Elired and Ethelgiva, virgins. His health was so bad 
that he was constantly disquieted either by the piles or some 
disorder of the intestines. It is said, however, that he 
entreated this from God, in his supplications, in order that, 
by the admonition of pain, he might be less anxious after 
earthly defighte. 

Yet amid these circumstances the private life of the king 
is to be admired and celebrated with the highest praise. 
For although, as some one has said, '* Laws must give way 
amid the strife of arms,** yet he, amid the sound of trumpets 
and the din of war, enacted statutes by which his people 
might equally familiarise themselves to religious worship 
and to military discipline. And since, from the example 
of the barbariims, the natives themselves began to lust after 
rapine, insomuch that there was no safe intercourse without 
a military guard, he appointed centuries, which they call 
'^ hundreds," and decennaries, that is to say, '* tythings,'' so 
that every Englishman, living according to law, must be a 
member of both. If any one was accused of a crime, he 



118 UnCLUAM OF HAUCESBITBr. [B-n.^t. 

was obliged immediately to produce personfl firom the hun- 
dred and tything to become his surety ; and whosoever was 
unable to fbdd such surety, must dread the severity of the 
laws. If any who was impleaded made his escape either 
before or after he had found surety, all persons of the hun- 
dred and tything paid a fbde to the king. By this regulation 
he diffused such peace throughout the country, that he or- 
dered golden bracelets, which might mock the eager desires 
of the passengers while no one durst take them away, to be 
hung up on the public causeways, where the roads croesed 
each other. Ever intent on ahnsgiving, he oonfinned the 
privileges of the churches, as appointed by his father, and 
sent many presents over sea to Rome and to St. Thomas in 
India. Sighelm, bishop of Sherborne, sent ambassador for 
this purpose, penetrated successfully into India, a matter of 
astonishment even in the present time. Betuming thence, 
he brought back many brilliant exotic gems and aromatic 
juices in which that country abounds, and a present more 
precious than the finest gold, part of our Saviour's cross, 
sent by pope Marinus to tibe king. He erected monasteries 
wherever he deemed it fitting; one in Athelney, where he 
lay concealed, as has been above related, and there he made 
John abbat^ a native of Old Saxony ; another at Winchester, 
which is caJled the New-minster, where he appdnted Grrim- 
bald abbat^ who, at his invitation, had been sent into Eng- 
land by Fulco archbishop of Rheims, known to him, as they 
8&y» by having kindly entertained him when a child on hu 
way to Rome. The cause of his being sent for was that by 
his activity he might awaken the study of literature in Eng- 
land, which was now slumbering and almost expiring. The 
monastery of Shaftesbury also he filled with nuns, where he 
made his daughter Ethdgiva abbess. From St. David's he 
procured a person named Asser,* a man of skill in literature, 
whom he made bishop of Sherborne. This man explained 
the meaning of the works of Boethius, on the Consolation 
of Philosophy, in clearer terms, and the king himself trans- 
lated them into the English language. And since there was 
no good scholar in his own kingdom, he sent for Werefrith

king readered into the English tongue the books of Gre- 
gory's Dialogues. At this time Johannes Scotus is supposed 
to have lived; a man of clear understanding and mnftzing 
eioquenoe. He had long since, from the continued tumult 
of war around him, retired into France to Charles the Bald, 
at whose request he had translated the Hierarchia of Diony- 
sius the Aieopagite, word for word, out of the Greek into 
Latin. He composed a book also, which he entitled <n^/ 
f^tfktfr ^i^jcMUy or Of the Division of Nature,* extremely 
Qseful in solving the perplexity of certain indi^nsable in- 
quiries, if he be pardoned for some things in which he de- 
viated from the opinions of the Latins, through too close 
attention to the Greeks. In after time, allured by the muni- 
fioenoe of Alfred, he came into EngUmd, and at our monas- 
tery, as report says, was pierced with the iron styles of the 
boys whom he was instructing, and was even looked upon as 
a martyr ; which phrase I have not made use of to the dis- 
paragement of his holy spirit, as though it were matter of 
doubt, especially as his tomb on the left side of the altar, 
and the verses of his epitaph, record his famcf These, 
thoagh ragged and deficient in the polish of oor days, are 
not 00 uncouth for ancient times :

On eaith were gnc^d with deepest learning's piaiae : 
Deemed meet at last hj martyrdom to gain 
Christ^ kingdom, where the saints for ever reign.** 

Confiding in these auxiliaries, the king gave his whole 
soul to the cultivation of the liberal arts, insomuch that no \ 
Englishman was quicker in comprehending, or more elegant 
in translating. This was the more remarkable, because until 
twelve years of age he absolutely knew nothing of literature.}

vu not then living. There is, however, no positive notice of the time of 
his death. The story indeed has so much the air of one told in Asser of

books were Orosiusi Gregory's Pastoral, Bede(*s History of

gard for literature into his countiymen, stimulating them 
both with rewards and punishments, allowing no ignorant 
person to aspire to any dignity in the oonrt. He died just 
as he had begun a translation of the Psalms. In the pro- 
logue to <^ The Pastoral " he observes, ^* that he was incited 
to translate these books into English because the churches 
which had formerly contained numerous libraries had, to- 
gether with thdr books, been burnt by the Danes.* And 
again, ''that the pursuit of literature had gone to decay 
almost over the whole island, because each person was moope 
occupied in the preservation of his life than in the perusal 
of books; wherefore he so far consulted the good of his 
countrymeai, that they might now hastily view what here- 
after, if peace should ever return, they might thoroughly 
comprehend in the Latin language.'' Again, '' That he de- 
signed to transmit this boo^ transcribed by his order, to

in this or his other translations, but that everytiiing was 
derived from those celebrated men Pl^mundl archbishop

into two equal parts, the first was again subdivided into

eourt, the second to artificers whom he constantly employed 
in the erection of new edifices, in a manner surprising and 
hitherto unknown to the English, the third he gave to 
itiangers. The second part of the revenue was divided in 
such a mode that the first portion should be given to the 
poor of bis kingdom, the second to the monasteries, the 
third to scholars,! the fourth to foreign churches^ He was 
a strict inquirer into the sentences passed by his magistrates, 
and a severe corrector of such an were unjust He had one 
unusual and unheard of custom, which was, that he always 
carried in his bosom a book in which the daily order of the 
Psalms was contained, for the purpose of carefully perusing 
it, if at any time he had leisure. In this way he passed his 
life, much respected by neighbouring princes, and gave his 
daughter Ethelswitha in marriage to Baldwin earl of Flan- 
ders, by whom he had Amulf and Ethelwulf ; the former 
received £rom his father the county of Boulogne, from the 
other at this day are descended the earls of Flanders.) 

Alfred, paying the debt of nature, was buried at Winches-

extorted from him ; but he did not choose to offer a sacrifice 
to God from the robbery of the poor. These two churches 
were so contiguous, that, when singing, they heard each 
others* voices ; on this and other accounts an unhappy 
jealousy was daily stirring up causes of dissension, which 
.produced frequent injuries on either side. For this feaaon 
th&t monastery was lately removed out of the city, and 
became a more healthy, as well as a more conspicuous, resi- 
dence. They report that Alfred was first buried in the 
cathedral, because his monastery was unfinished, but that 
afterwards, on account of the folly of the canons, who as- 
serted that the royal spirit, resuming its carcass, wandered 
nightly through the buildings, Edward, his son and suc- 
cessor, removed the remains of his father, and gave them a 
quiet resting-place in the new minster.* These and similar 
superstitions, such as that the dead body of a wicked maa

CHAP. V. 

Of Edward the swi qfM/red, [a.d. 901—924.] 

In the year of our Lord's incarnation, 901, Edward, the son 
of Alfred, succeeded to the government, and held it twenty 
three years : he was much inferior to his father in literature, 
but greatiy excelled in extent of power. For Alfred, indeed, 
united the two kingdoms of the Mercian and West Saxons, 
holding that of the Mercians only nominally, as he had 
assigned it to prince Ethelred : but at his death Edward 
first brought the Mercians altogether under his power, next, 
the West§ and East Angles, and Northumbrians, who had 

* On its removal called Hyde Abbey. 

f The popular notion was,^ that the devil re-animated the corpse, and 
played a variety of pranks by its agency; and that the only remedy vas to 
dig up and consume the body with fire. See Will. Nenbrigk v. 2*2.

beoome one nation with the Danes ; the Scots, who inhabit 
the northern part of the island ; and all the Britons, whom 
we caH Welsh, afW perpetual battles, in which he was 
alwajB sacoessfol. He devised a mode of frustrating the 
mcursions of the Danes ; for he repaired many ancient cities, 
or built new ones, in places calculated for hi^ purpose, and 
filled them with a military force, to protect the inhabitants 
and repel the enemy. Nor was his design unsuccessful ; for 
the inhabitants became so extremely valorous in these con* 
tests, that if they heard of an enemy approaching, they 
rushed out to give them battle, even without consulting the 
king or bis generals, and constantly surpassed them, both in 
number and in warlike skilL Thus the enemy became an 
object of contempt to the soldiery and of derision to the 
king. At last some fresh assailants, who had come over 
under the command of Ethelwald, the son of the king's 
und^ were all, together with himself, cut off to a man; 
those before, settled in the country, being either destroyed 
or spared under the denomination of Aogles. Ethelwald 
indeed had attempted many things in the earlier days of this 
king ; and, disdaining subjection to hioi, declared himself 
his inferior neither in birth nor valour ; but being driven 
into exHe by the nobility, who had sworn allegiance to 
Edward, he brought over the pirates ; with whom, meeting 
his death, as I have related, he gave proof of the folly of 
resisting those who are our superiors in power. Although 
Edward may be deservedly praised for these transactions, 
yet, in my opinion, the palm should be more especially given 
to his father, who certainly laid the foundation of this extent 
of dominion. And here indeed Ethelfled, sister of the 
king and relict of Ethered, ought not to be forgotten, as she 
was a powerful accession to his parfy, the delight of his sub- 
jects, the dread of his enemies, a woman of an enlarged soul, 
who, from the difficulty experienced in her first labour, ever 
after refused the embraces of her husband ; protesting that 
it was unbecoming the daughter of a king to give way to a 
delight which, after a time, produced such painful conse- 
quences. This spirited heroine assisted her brother greatly 
with her advice, was of equal service in building cities, nor 
could you easily discern, whether it was more owing to for- 
tune or her own exertions, that a woman should be able to

protect men at home, and to intimidate them abroad. She 
died fiye jears before her brother, and was bnried in tiie 
monastery of St Peter's, at G-loacester ; which, in conjunc- 
tion with her hnsband, Ethered, she had erected with great 
solicitude. Thither too she had transferred the bones of St 
Oswald, the king, from Bardnej ; but this monastery beii^ 
destroyed in succeeding time by the Danes, Aldred, arch- 
bishop of York, founded another, which is now the diief in 
that city. 

As the king had many daughters, he gave Edgiva to 
Charles, king of France, the son of Lewis the Stammerer, 
son of Charles the Bald, whose daughter, as I have repeat- 
edly observed, Ethelwulf had married on his return from 
Rome ; and, as the opportunity has now presented itself, the 
candid reader will not think it irrelevant^ if I state the 
names of his wives and children. By Egwina, an iUustrioos 
lady, he had Athelstan, his first-bom, and a daughter, whoM 
name I cannot particularise, but her brother gave her in 
marriage to Sihtric, king of the Northumbrians. The second 
son of Edward was Ethdward, by EMeda, daughter of earl 
Etheline ; deeply versed in literature, much resembling his 
grandfather Alfred in features and disposition, but who d»* 
parted, by an early death, soon after his father. By the 
same wife he had Edwin, of whose fate what the received 
opinion is I shall hereafter describe, not with confidence, but 
doubtingly. By her too he had six daughters; Edfleda, 
Edgiva, Ethelhilda, Ethilda, Edgitha, Elgifa: the first and 
third vowing celibacy to God, renounced the pleasure of 
earthly nuptials ; Edfleda in a religious, and Ethelhilda in a 
lay habit: they both lie buried near their mother, at Wia* 
Chester. Her father gave Edgiva, as I have mentioned, to 
king Charles,* and her brother, Athelstan, gave Ethilda to 
Hughzf this same brother also sent Edgitha and Elgi£a to 
Henry, { emperor of Germany, the second of whom he gave 
to his son Otho^ the other to a certain duke, near the Alps.

Again ; bj Ids third "vnfe, named Edgira, he had two sona,

two daughtera, Eadbnrga, and Edgiva ; Eadburga, a virgin, 
dedicated to Christy lies buried at Winchester; Edgiya, a 
lady of incomparable beaatj, was united, bj her brother 
Athelstan, to Lewis^ prince of Aquitaine.* Edward had 
brought up his daughters in such wise, that in childhood 
thej gave their whole attention to literature and afterwards 
employed themsdves in the labours of the distaff and the 
needle, that thus they might chastely pass their virgin age. 
£G8 eons were so educated, as, first, to have the completest 
benefit of learning, that afterwards they might succeed to 
govern the state, not like rustics, but philosophers. 

Charles, the son-in-law of Edward, constrained thereto by 
BoUo, through a succession of calamities, conceded to him 
that part of Graul which at present is called Normandy. It 
would be tedious to relate for how many years, and with 
what audacity, the Nonnans disquieted every place from the 
Britiah ocean, as I have said, to the Tuscan sea. First 
Hasten, and then BoUo ; who^ bom of noble lineage among 
the Norw^iaiis, though obsolete firom its extreme antiquity, 
was banished, by the king's conmiand, from his own country, 
and brought over with hnn multitudes, who were in danger, 
either from debt or consciousness of guilt, and whom he had 
allured by great expectations of advantage. Betaking him-> 
self therefore to piracy, after his cruelty had raged on 
every side at pleasure, he experienced a check at Chartres. 
For the townspeople, relying neither on arms nor fortifica- 
tions, piously implored the assistance of the blessed Virgin 
Mary. The shift too of the virgin, which Charles the Bald 
had brought with other relics from Constantinoi^e, they 
displayed to the winds on the ramparts, thronged by -the 
garrison, after the fashion of a banner. The enemy on see- 
ing it b^an to laugh, and to direct their arrows at it. This, 
however, was not done with impunity; for presently their 
^es became dim, and they could neither retreat nor ad- 
vance. The townsmen, with joy perceiving this, indulged

permitted. Hollo, however^ whom God reserved for the 
true faith, escaped, and soon after gained Bouen and the 
neighbouring dties by force of arms, in the year of our Lord 
876, and one year before the death of Charles the Bald, 
whose grandson Lewis, as is before mentioned, vanquished 
the Normans, but did not expel them: but Charles, the 
brother of tliat Lewis, grandson of Charles the Bald, by his 
son Lewis, as I have said above, repeatedly experiencing, 
from unsuccessful conflicts, that fortune gave him nothing 
which she took from others, resolved, after consulting his 
nobility, that it was advisable to make a show of royal 
munificence, when he was unable to repel injuiy ; and, in a 
fidendly manner, sent for RoUo. He was at tbls tune far 
advanced in years ; and, consequently, easily inclined to 
pacific measures. It was therefore determined by treaty, 
that he should be baptized, and hold that country of the 
king as his lord. The inbred and untameable ferocity of the 
man may well be imagined, for, on receiving this gift, as the 
by standers suggested to him, that he ought to kiss the foot 
of his benefactor, disdaining to kneel down, he seized th& 
king's foot and dbragged it to his mouth as he stood erect 
The king falling on his back, the Normans began to laugh, 
and the Franks to be indignant; but Rollo apologised fix 
his shameful conduct^ by saying that it was tiie custom of 
his country. Thus the afiair being settled, BoUo tetozned 
to Bouen, and there died. 

The son of this Charles was Lewis : he being challenged 
by one Isembard, that had turned pagan, and renounced his 
faith, called upon his nobility for their assistance : they not 
even deigned an answer ; when one Hugh, son of Bobert, 
earl of Mont Didier, a youth of no great celebrity at the 
time, voluntarily entered the lists for his lord and killed the 
challenger. Lewis, with his whole army pursuing to Pon- 
thieu, gained there a glorious triumph ; either destroying or 
putting to flight all the barbarians whom Isembard had 
brought with him. But not long after, weakened by ex- 
treme sickness, the consequence of this laborious expeditioD, 
he appointed this Hugh, a young man of noted faith and 
courage, heir to the kingdom. '[Oius the lineage of Charles

the English nation firom the seat of St. Peter, because for 
seven whole years the entire district of the Gewissae, that is, 
of the West-Saxons, had been destitute of bishops. On hear- 
ing this, king Edward assembled a council of the senators of 
the English, over which presided Pl^;mund, archbishop of 
Ganterbuiy, interpreting carefully the words of the apostolic 
legation. Then the king and ihe bishops chose for them- 
selves and their followers a salutary council, and, according 
to our Saviour's words, * The harvest truly is plenteous, but

that he who should invalidate this decree should be damned 
everlastingly.''

siderable revenues, and in which he had buried his brother 

Ethelward four years before.

CHAP. VL 

OfAiheUtan, the «o» ^Edward, [a.ii. 924— S40.] 

In the year of our Lord's incarnation 924, Athelstan, the son 
of Edward, began to reign, and held the sovereignty sixteen 
years. His brother, Ethelward, dying a few days after his 
father, had been buried with him at Winchester. At this 
place, therefore, Athelstan, being elected king by the unani- 
mous consent of the nobility, he was crowned at a royal 
town, which is called Kingston ; though one Elfred, whose 
death we shall hereafter relate in the words of the king, with 
his factious party, as sedition nevw wants adherents, at- 
tempted to prevent it. The ground of his opposition, as 
they aflirm, was, that Athelstan was born of a concubine. 
But having nothing ignoble in him, except this stain, if after 
all it be true, he cast aU his predecessors into the shade by 
his piety, as well as the glory of all their triumphs, by the 
splendour of his own. So much more excellent is it to have 
^t for which we are renowned inherent, than derived firam 
our ancestors ; because the former is exclusively our own, 
the latter is imputable to others. I forbear relating how 
many new and magnificent monasteries he founded ; but I 
will not conceal that there was scarcely an old one in Eng- 



A.D-S270 ATHEL8TAN. 129 

Und which he did not embeUish, either with buildings, or 
(irnaments, or hooka, or possessionB. Thus he ennobled the 
new ones expreaslj, but the old, as though they were only 
casual objects of his kindness. With Sihtric, king of the 
Northumbrians, who married, as I have before said, one of 
bis sisters, he made a lasting covenant ; he dying ailer a 
year, Athelstan took that province under his own govem- 
ment) expelling one Aldulph, who resisted him. And as a 
noble mind, when once roused, aspires to greater things, he 
compelled Jothwel, king of idl the Welsh, and Constantine, 
lung of the Scots, to quit their kingdoms ; but not long after, 
moved with commiseration, he restored them to their origi- 
nal state, that they might reign under him, saying, ^' it was 
more glorious to make than to be a king.'' His last contest 
was with Anlaf, the son of Sihtric, who^ with the before- 
named Constantine, again in a state of rebellion, had entered 
his territories under the hope of gaining the kingdom. 
Athelstan purposely retreating, that he might derive greater 
honour from vanquishing his furious assailants, this bold 
jooth, meditating unlawful conquests, had now proceeded 
&r into £ngland, when he was opposed at Bruneford* by the 
most experienced generals, and most valiant forces. Per- 
ceiving, at length, what danger hung over him, he assumed 
the character of a spy. Laying aside his royal ensigns, and 
taking a harp in his hand, he proceeded to our king's tent : 
singing before the entrance, and at times touching the trem- 
bling strings in harmonious cadence, he was readily admitted, 
professing himself a minstrel, who procured his daily suste- 
nance by such employment. Here he entertained the king 
and his companions for some time with his musical perform- 
ance, carefully examining everything while occupied in sing- 
ing. When satiety of eating had put an end to their sensual 
enjoyments, and the business of war was resumed among the 
nobles, he was ordered to depart, and received the recom- 
pence of his song ; but disdaining to take it away, he hid it 
beneath him in the earth. This circumstance was remarked 
by a person, who had formerly served under him, and im- 
mediately related it to Athelstan. The king, blaming him

fore thenu received this answer : ** The same oath, whieh I 
have lately sworn to jrou, O king, I formerly made to An* 
laf ) and had you seen me violate it towards him, jou mi^t 
have expected similar perfidy towards yourself: bat eon- 
descend to fisten to the advice of your servant, whieh is, that 
jon should remove your tent hence, and remaining in another 
place till the residue of the army come up, yon will destroy 
your ferocious enemy by a moderate delay." Approving 
this admonition, he removed to another place. Anlaf ad- 
vancing, well prepared, at nighty put to d^th, together with 
the whole of his followers, a certain bishop,* who had joined 
the army only the evening before, and, ignorant of what had 
passed, had pitched his tent there on account of the levd 
turf. Proceeding farther, he found the king himsdf equally 
unprepared ; who, little expecting his enemy capable of such 
nn attack, had indulged in profound repose. But, when 
roused fh>m his sleep by the excessive tumult, and ui^ng 
his people, as much as the darkness of the night would per- 
mit, to the conflict, his sword fell by chance from the sheath ; 
upon which, while all things were filled with dread and Wnd 
confusion, he invoked the protection of Grod and of St Aid- 
helm, who was distantly related to him ; and replacing his 
hand upon the scabbard, he there found a swoH, which is 
kept to this day, on account of the miracle, in the treasury 
of the kings. Moreover, it is, as they say, chased in one part, 
but can never be inlaid either with gold or silver. Confiding 
in this divine present, and at the same time, as it b^^ to 
dawn, attacking the Norwegian, he continued the battle 
unwearied through the day, and put him to flight with his 
whole army. There fdl Constantine, king of the Scots, a 
man of treacherous energy and vigorous old age ; five other 
kings, twelve earls, and ahnost the whole assemblage of bar- 
barians. The few who escaped were preserved to embrace 
the faith of Christ. 

Concerning this king a strong persuasion is prevaleot 
among the English, that one more just or learned never go- 
verned the kingdom. That he was versed in literature, I

di800Tered a few dajs sinoe, in a eertain old volume, wherein 
the writer struggles with the difficultj of the task, unable to 
express his meaning as he wished. Indeed I would subjoin 
his words for breyit/s sake, were thej not extravagant be- 
yond belief in the praises of the king, and just in that stjle 
of writing which Cicero, the prince of Roman eloquence, 
in his book on Rhetoric, denominates " bombast" The cus- 
t(Hn of that time excuses the diction, and the affection for 
Athelstan, who was jet living, gave countenance to the ex- 
cess of praise. I shall subjoin, therefore, in familiar lan- 
guage, some few circumstances which may tend to augment 
his reputation. 

Song Edward, after many noble exploits, both in war and 
peace, a few days before his death subdued the contumacy of 
the ci^ of Chester, which was rebelling in confederacy with 
the Britons ; and placing a garrison there, he fell sick and 
died at Faringdon, and was buried, as I before related, at 
Winchester. Athelstan, as his father had commanded in his 
will, was then hailed king, recommended by his years, — ^for 
he was now thirty, — and the maturity of his wisdom. For 
even his grandfather Alfred, seeing and embracing him affec- 
tionately when he was a boy of astonishing beauty and 
graceful manners, had most devoutly prayed that his govern- 
ment might be prosperous: indeed, he had made him a 
knight* unusually early, giving him a scarlet cloak, a belt 
stndded with diamonds, and a Saxon sword with a golden 
scabbard. Next he had provided that he should be educated 
in the court of Ethelfled his daughter, and of his son-in- 
law Eihered ; so that, having been brought up in expecta- 
tion of succeeding to the kingdom, by the tender care of his 
aunt and of this celebrated prince, he repressed and destroyed 
all envy by the lustre of his good qualities ; and, after the 
death of his father, and decease of his brother, he was 
crowned at Kingston. Hence, to celebrate such splendid 
events, and the joy of that illustrious day, the poet justly 
exclaims : 

* This panage i> thought to proTo the existence of knights as a distinct 
Older among the Saxons; and, coupled with the case of Herewaid, it has 
ynrj much that air. See Mr. Turner's Anglo-Saxons, 4, 171, et inf. But 
perhaps in the present instance, it may amount to nothing more than 
bestowing his firrt arms on him. Lewis the Debonnaire rooeivod his aims,

132 WILLIAM OP MALMBSBTJRr. Lb-u-c*. 

Of royal noe a noble stem 
Hath chased our darknen like a gem. 
Great Athelstan, his country's pride, 
Whose virtue never turns aside ; 
Sent by his &ther to the schools, 
Patient, he bore their rigid rulea. 
And drinking deep of science mild, 
Pajased his first years unlike a child. 
Next clothed in youth's bewitching charms, 
Studied Uic harsher lore of arms, 
Which soon confessed his knowledge keen. 
As after in the sovereign seen. 
Soon as his father, good and great. 
Yielded, though ever famed, to fate. 
The youth was called the realm to guide, 
And, like his parent, well preside. 
The nobles meet, the crown present. 
On rebels, prelates curses vent ; 
The people light the festive fires. 
And show by turns their kind desires. 
Their deeds their loyalty declare, 
Though hopes and fears their bosoms share. 
With festive treat the court abounds ; 
Foams the brisk wine, the hall resounds : 
The pages run, the servants haste. 
And food and vene regale the taste. 
The minstrels sinjg, the guests commend, 
Whilst all in praise to Christ contend. 
The king with pleasure all things sees. 
And all his kind attentions please. 

The solemnity of the consecration being finished, Athei- 
gtan, that he might not deceiye the expectation of his subjects, 
and fall below ^eir opinion, subdued the whole of England, 
except Northumbria, by the single terror of his name. One 
Sihtric, a relation of that Gothrun who is mentioned in the 
history of Alfred, presided over this people, a barbarian both 
by race and disposition, who, though he ridiculed the power 
of preceding kings, humbly solicited affinity with Athelstan, 
sending messengers expressly for the purpose ; and himself 
shortly following confirmed the proposals of the ambassadors. 
In consequence, honoured by a union with his sister, and 
by various presents, he laid the basis of a perpetual treaty. 
But, as I hare before observed, dying at the end oT a year, 
he afforded Athelstan an opportunity for uniting Northum- 
bria, which belonged to him both by ancient right and recent 
affinity, to his sovereignty. Anlaf, the son of Sihtric, then 



A.ik. fiU.] ATHBLSTAN. 133 

fled into Ireland, and his brother Guthferth into Scotland. 
Mesaengers from the king immediately followed to Constan- 
tine, king of the Scots, and Eugenius, king of the Cumbrians, 
claiming the fugitive under a threat of war. The barbarians 
had no idea of resistance, but without delaj coming to a 
place called Dacor, they surrendered themselyes and their 
kingdoms to the sovereign of England. Out of regard to 
this treaty, the king himself stood for the son of Constantine, 
who was ordered to be baptized, at the sacred font. Guth- 
ferth, however, amid the preparations for the journey, escaped 
by flight with one Turfrid, a leader of the opposite party ; 
and afterwards laying siege to York, where he could succeed 
in bringing the townsmen to surrender neither by entreaties 
nor by threats, he departed. Not long after, being both 
shut up in a castle, they eluded the vigilance of the guards, 
and escaped. Turfrid, losing his life quickly after by ship- 
wreck, became a prey to fishes. Guthferth, suffering ex- 
tremely both by sea and land, at last came a suppliant to 
court. Being amicably received by the king, and sumptuous- 
ly entertained for four days, he resought his ships ; an 
incorrigible pirate, and accustomed to live in the water like 
a fish. In the meantime Athelstan levelled with the ground 
the castle which the Danes had formerly fortified in York, 
that there might be no place for disloyalty to shelter in ; 
and the booty which had been found there, which was very 
considerable, he generously divided, man by man, to the 
whole army. For he had prescribed himself this rule of 
conduct, never to hoard up riches ; but liberally to expend 
all his acquisition either on monasteries or on his faithful 
followers. On these, during the whole of his life, he ex- 
pended bis paternal treasures, as well as the produce of his 
victories. To the clergy he was humble and affable ; to the 
laity mild and pleasant ; to the nobility rather reserved, fix>m 
respect to his dignity ; to the lower classes, laying aside the 
stateliness of power, he was kind and condescending. He 
was, as we have heard, of becoming stature, thin in person, 
his hair flaxen, as I have seen by his remains, and beautifully 
wreathed with golden threads. Extremely beloved by his 
subjects &om admiration of his fortitude and humility, he 
was terrible to those who rebelled against him, through his 
invincible courage. He compelled the rulers of the northern 



184 WIIXIAll OF HAtafiKSBURT. (ii.n.c.& 

W^li, that 18, of the North Britons, to meet him at the fitj 
of Hereford, and after some opposition to surrender to hw 
power. So that he actaaily hrought to pass what no king 
before him had even presumed to think of : which was, that 
they should pay annually by way of tribute, twenty pocmds 
of gold, three hundred of silver, twenty-five thousand oxen, 
besides as many dogs as he might choose, which from their 
sagacious scent could discover the retreats and hiding places 
of wild beasts ; and birds, trained to make prey of others in 
the air. Departing thence^ he turned towards the Western 
Britons, who are called the Gomwallish, because, situated in 
the west of Britain, they are opposite to the extremity of 
Gaul.* Fiercely attacking, he obliged them to retreat fixim 
Exeter, which, till that time, they had inhabited with equal 
privileges with the Angles, fixing the boundary of their 
province on the other side of the river Tamar, as he had ap- 
pointed the river Wye to the North Britons. This city then, 
which he had cleansed by purging it of its contaminated 
race, he fortified with towers and surrounded with a wall of 
squared stone. And, though the barren and unfruitful soil 
can scarcely produce indifferent oats, and frequently only the 
empty husk without the grain, yet, owing to the magnificence 
ef the city, the opulence of its inhabitants, and the constant 
resort of strangers, every kind of merchandise is there so 
abundant that nothing is wanting which can conduce to hu- 
man comfort. Many noble traces of him are to be seen in 
that city, as well as in the neighbouring district, which will 
be better described by the conversation of the natives, than 
by my narrative. 

On this account all Europe resounded with his praises, 
and extolled his valour to the skies : foreign prinoes with 
justice esteemed themselves happy if they could purchase his 
friendship either by affinity or by presents. Harold king of 
Norway sent him a ship with golden beak and a purple sail, 
furnished within with a compacted fence of gilded shields. 
The names of the persons sent with it, were Helgrim and 
Offrid : who, being received with princely magnificence in 
the city of York, were amply compensated, by rich presents, 
for the labour of their journey. Henry the First, for there 
were many of the name, the son of Conrad, king of the

IWatanianfl and emperor of the Bomans, demanded his sbter, 
M I ha^e before related, for his son Otho ; passing over so 
man J neighbouring kings, bat contemplating from a distance 
Atheistan's noble descent, and greatness of mind. So com- 
pletely indeed had these two qualities taken up their abode 
with him, that none could be more noble or iUustrious in 
descent ; none more bold or prompt in disposition. Maturely 
considering that he had four sisters, who were all equally 
beautiful, except only as their ages made a difference, he 
sent two to the emperor at his request ; and how he disposed 
of them in marriage has already been related : Lewis prince 
of Aquitania, a descendant of Charles the Great, obtained 
the third in wedlock : the fourth, in whom the whole essence 
of beauty had centred, which the others only possessed in 
part, was demanded from her brother by Hugh king of the 
Franks.* The chief of this embassy was Adulph, son of 
Baldwin earl of Flanders by £thelswitha daughter of king 
Edward* f When he had declared the request of the suitor 
in an assembly of the nobility at Abingdon, he produced such 
liberal presents as might gratify the most boundless avarice : 
perfumes such as never had been seen in England before : 
jewels, but more especially emeralds, the greenness of which, 
reflected by the sun, illumined the countenances of the 
bystanders with agreeable light : many fleet horses with 
their trappings, and, as Yiigil says, " Champing their golden 
bits :** an alabaster vase so exquisitely chased, that, the com- 
fielda really seemed to wave, the vines to bud, the figures of 
mesa actually to move, and so clear and pohshed, that it 
reflected the features like a mirror ; the sword of Constantine 
the Great, on which the name of its original possessor was 
read in golden letters ; on the pommel, upon thick plates of 
gold, might be seen fixed an iron spike, one of the four 
which the Jewish faction prepared for the crucifixion of our 
Lord : the spear of Charles the Great, which whenever that 
invincible emperor hurled in his expeditions against the 
Saracens, he idways came off conqueror ; it was reported to 
be the same, which, driven into the side of our Saviour by

the J073 of paradise to wretched mortab : the banner of the 
most blessed martjr Maurice, chief of the Theban legion ; f 
with which the same king, in the Spanish war, used to break 
through the battalions of the enemy however fierce and 
wedged together, and put them to flight : a diadem, precious 
from its quantity of gold, but more so for its jewels, the 
splendour of which threw the sparks of light so strongly on 
the beholders, that the more stedfastly any peraon en- 
deavoured to gaze, so much the more he was dazsded, 
and compelled to avert his eyes ; part of the holy and 
adorable cross enclosed in crystal ; where the eye, piercii^ 
through the substance of the stone, might discern the colour 
and size of the wood ; a small portion of the crown of thorns, 
enclosed in a similar manner, which, in derision of his 
government^ the madness of the soldiers placed on Christ's 
sacred head. The king, delighted with such great and 
exquisite presents, made an equal return of good offices ; 
and gratified the soul of the longing suitor by a union with 
his sister. Wfth some of these presents he enriched 
succeeding kings : but to MaJmesbury he gave part of the 
cross and crown ; by the support of which, I believe, that 
place even now flourishes, though it has suffered so many 
shipwrecks of its liberty, so many attacks of its enemies.} 
In this place he ordered Elwin and Ethelwin, the sons of his 
uncle Ethelward, whom he had lost in the battle against 
Anlaf, to be honourably buried, expressing his design of 
resting here himself : of which battle it is now prop^ time 
to give the account of that poet, from whom I have taken all 
these transactions.

And drive the harmless natives from the coast 
Thus, while the king, secure in youthful pride, 
Bade the soft hours in gentle pleasures glide, 
Though erst he stemmed the battle's furious tide. 
With ceaseless plunder sped the daring horde, 
And wasted districts with their 6re and sword. 
The Terdant crops lay withering on the fields 
The glebe no promise to the rustic yields. 
Immense the numbers of barbarian force, 
Countiess the squadrons both of foot and horse. 
At length fame's rueful moan alarmed the king. 
And bade bim shun this ignominious sting, 
That arms like his to ruffian bands should bend : 
'Tis done : delays and hesitations end. 
High in the air the threatening banners fly. 
And call his eager troops to victory.

This place seems to require that I should relate the death 
of Elfred in the words of the king, for which I before 
pledged the faith of my narrative. For as he had commanded 
the bodies of his relations to be conveyed to Mahnesbury, 
and interred at the head of the sepulchre of St. Aldhehn ; 
he honoured the place afterwards to such a degree, that he 
esteemed none more desirable or more holy. Bestowing 
many large estates upon it, he confirmed them by charters, 
in one of which, after the donation, he adds : *^ Be it known 
to the sages of our kingdom, that I have not unjustly seized 
the lands aforesaid, or dedicated plunder to Grod ; but that I 
have received them, as the English nobility, and even John, 
the pope of the church of Rome himsdf, have judged 



138 WILLUIC OV lf4r,imifBUtt l . [«.n.c«L 

fitting on the death of Elfred. He was the jealons rival both 
of mj hal^piness and life, and consented to the wickedness of 
my enemies, who, on my father's decease, had not Grod in his 
mercy delivered me, wished to put oat my eyes in the dfy 
of Winchester : wherefore, on the discovery of their 
infernal contrivances, he was sent to the church of Rome to 
defend himself by oath before pope John. This he did at 
the altar of St. Peter ; but at the very instant he had sworn, 
he fell down before it, and was carri^ by his servants to the 
English School, where he died the third night after. The 
pope immediately sent to consult with us, whether his body 
should be placed among other Christians. On receiving this 
account the nobility of our kingdom, with the whole body of 
his relations, humbly entreated that we would grant oar 
permission for his remains to be buried with other 
Christians. Consenting, therefore, to their urgent request, 
we sent back our compUanoe to Rome, and with the poj[fe*s 
permission he was buried, though unworthy, with otiier 
Christians. In consequence all his property of eveiy 
description was adjudged to be mine. Moreover, we have 
noted this in writing, that, so long as Christianity reigns, it 
may never be abrogated, whence the aforesaid land, which I 
have given to Grod and St. Peter, was granted me ; nor do I 
know any thing more just, than that I should bestow this 
gift on Grod and St Peter, who caused my rival to fall in 
the sight of all persons, and conferred on me a prosperous 
reign." 

In these words of the king, we may equally venerate his 
wisdom, and his piety in sacred matters : his wisdom, that 
so young a man should perceive that a sacrifice obtained by 
rapine could not be acceptable to God : his piety in so grate- 
fully making a return to Grod, out of a benefit conferred on 
him by divine vengeance. Moreover, it may be necessary to 
observe, that at that time the church of St Peter was the 
chief of the monastery, which now is deemed second only : 
the church of St Mary, which the monks at present fre- 
quent, was built afterwards in the time of king Edgar, under 
abbat Elfric. Thus &r relating to the king I have written 
from authentic testimony : that which follows I have learned 
more from old ballads, popular through succeeding times, 
than from books written expressly for the informati(m of

poBterkj. I bare rabjoined them, not to defend their 
veraeitj, bat to put mj reader in possession of all I know. 
Fint, then^ to the relation of his larth. 

There was in a certain village, a shepherd's daughter, a 
gill of exquisite beauty, who gained through the elegance of 
her person what her birth could never have bestowed. In a 
naioo die beheld a prodigy: the moon shone from her 
womb, and all England was illuminated bj the light. When 
she sportiTelj related this to h^ companions in the morning, 
it was not so lightly received, but immediately reached the 
etFB of the woman who had nursed the sons of the king. 
Deliberating on this matter, she took her home and adopt^ 
ber as a daughter, bringing up this young maiden with cost- 
lier attire, more delicate food, and more d^ant demeanour. 
Soon after, Edward, the son of king .Alfred, travelling 
tlutNigh the village, stopped at the house which had been the 
seene of his infantine education. Indeed, he thought it would 
be a blemish on his reputation to omit paying his salutations 
to his nurse. He became deeply enamoured of the young 
woman from the first moment he saw her, and passed the 
night with her. In consequence of this single intercourse, 
she brought forth her son Athelstan, and so realized her 
dream. For at the expiration of his childish years, as he 
approached manhood, he gave proof by many actions what 
JQ8t expectations of noble qualities might be entertained of 
hinL King Edward, therefore, di^, and was shortiy 
followed by his legitimate son Ethelward. All hopes now 
centred in Athelstan : Elfred alone, a man of uncommon 
ioH^ce, disdaining to be governed by a sovereign whom he 
Iiad not voluntarily chosen, secretly opposed with his party to 
the very utmost. But he being detected and punished, as 
the king has before related, there were some who even 
MCQsed Edwin, the king's brother, of treacheir. Base and 
^leadful crime was it thus to embroil fratemiu a£Pection by 
Buuster constructions. Edwin, though imploring, both 
penonally and by messengers, the confidence of his brother, 
aod though invalidating the accusation by an oath, was 
iterertheless driven into exile. So far, indeed, did the dark 
Bt^ggestions of some persons prevail on a mind distracted 
with various caresi that, forgetful of a brother's love, he ex- 
pciOed the youth, an olject of pity even to strangers. The 



140 WILLIAM OF MALKE8BURT. [B.n.c.». 

mode adopted too was cruel in the extreme : he was com- 
pelled to go on board a vessel, with a single attendant, with- 
out a rower, without even an oar, and the bark crazj with 
age. Fortune laboured for a long time to restore the innocent 
youth to land, but when at length he was far out at sea, and 
sails could not endure the violence of the wind, the joung 
man, delicate, and weary of life under such drcumstanoes, 
put an end to his existence by a voluntary plunge into the 
waters. The attendant wisely determining to prolong bis 
life, sometimes by shunning tiie hostile waves, and some- 
times by urging the boat forward with his feet, brought his 
master's body to land, in the narrow sea which flows between 
Wissant and Dover. Athelstan, when his anger cooled, and 
his mind became calm, shuddered at the deed, and submitting 
to a seven years' penance, inflicted severe vengeance on 
the accuser of his brother : he was the king's cup-bearer, 
and on this account had opportunity of enforcing his insinu- 
ations. It so happened on a festive day, as he was serving 
wine, that slipping with one foot in the midst of the chamber, 
he recovered himself with the other. On this occasion, he 
made use of an expression which proved his destniction : 
" Thus brother," said he, " assists brother." The king on 
hearing this, ordered the faithless wretch to be pot to death, 
loudly reproaching him with the loss of that assistance he 
might have had from his brother, were he alive, and bewail- 
ing his death. 

The circumstances of Edwin's death, though extremely 
probable, I the less venture to affirm for truth, on account of 
the extraordinary affection he manifested towards the rest of 
his brothers ; for, as his father had left them very young, he 
cherished them whilst children with much kindness, and, 
when grown up, made them partakers of his kingdom ; it is 
before related to what dignity he exalted such of his sisters 
as his father had left unmarried and unprovided for. Com- 
pleting his earthly course, and that a short one, Athelstan 
died at Gloucester. His noble remains were conveyed to 
Malmesbury and buried under the altar. Many gifts, both 
in gold and silver, as well as relics of saints purchased 
abroad in Brittany, were carried before the body: for, 
in such things, admonished, as they say, in a dreun, he 
expended the treasures which his father had long since

Of kinffs Edmund, Edred, and Edwy. [a.i>. 940—955.] 

Ix the year of our Lord's incarnation 940, Edmund the bro- 
ther of Athelstan, a youth of about eighteen, received and 
held the government for six years and a half. In his time 
the Northumbrians, meditating a renewal of hostilities, vio- 
lated the treaty which they had made with Athelstan, and 
created Anlaf, whom they had recalled from Ireland, their 
king. Edmund, who thought it disgraceful not to complete 
his brother's victorious course, led his troops against the de- 
linquents ; who presently retreating, he subjugated all the 
cities on this side the river Humber. Anla^ with a certain 
prince, Ranald,* the son of that Gurmund of whom we have 
ipoken in the history of Alfred, sounding the disposition of 
the king, offered to surrender himself, proffering his conver- 
sion to Christianity as a pledge of his fidelity, and receiving 
haptism. His savage nature, however, did not let him re- 
nuun long in this resolution, for he violated his oath, and 
irritated his lord. In consequence of which, the following 
jear he suffered for his crimes, being doomed to perpetual 
exile. The province which is called Cumberland Edmund 
i^aigned to Malcolm, king of the Scots, under fealty of an 
oath. 

Among the many donations which the king conferred on 
different churches, he exalted that of Glastonbury, through 
his singular affection towards it, with great estates and ho- 
nours ; and granted it a charter in these words : 

^ In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, I Edmund, king 
of the Angles, and governor and ruler of the other surround- 
ing nations, with the advice and consent of my nobility, for 
the hope of eternal retribution, and remission of my trans- 
gressions, do grant to the church of the holy mother of God, 
Mary of Glastonbury, and the venerable Dunstan, whom I 
have there constituted abbat, the franchise and jurisdiction,

athas and ordelas, and infangenetheofas, hamsocne, and fri- 
debrice, §nd forestel and toll, and team, throughout mj king- 
dom, and their lands shall be free to them, and released from 
all exactions, as mj own are. But more especially shall the 
town of Glastonbury, in which is situated that most ancient 
church of the holy mother of Grod, together with its bounds, 
be more free than other places. The abbat of this place, 
alone, shall have power, as well in causes known as unknown ; 
in smaU and in great ; and even in those which are abore, 
and under the earth ; on dry land, and in the water ; in 
woods and in plains ; and he shall haye the same authority 
of punishing or remitting the crimes of delinquents perpetra- 
ted within it, as my court has ; in the same manner as my 
predecessors have granted and confirmed by charter ; to wit, 
Edward my father, and Elfred his father, and Kentwin, Ina, 
and Cuthred, and many others, who more peculiarly honoured 
and esteemed that noble place. And that any one, either 
bishop, or duke,f or prince, or any of their servants, should 
dare to enter it for the purpose of holding courts, or distrain- 
ing, or doing any thing contrary to the will of the ser- 
vants of Grod there, I inhibit. under God's curse. Whosoever 
therefore shall benevolently augment my donation, may his 
life be prosperous in this present world ; long may he enjoy 
his happiness : but whosoever shall presume to inyade it 
through his own rashness, let him know for certain that he 
shaU be compelled with fear and trembling to give account 
before the tribunal of a rigorous judge, unless he shall first 
atone for his ofi*ence by proper satisfaction." 

The aforesaid donation was granted in the year of our 

* The exact meaning of some of these terms is not easQy attainable, but 
they are generally understood to imply— jurisdiction over the b^ug>^ or 
town—hundred court — oaths and ordea]fl--tbieTe8 taken within the juris- 
diction — ^housebreakers — breach of peace— offences committed on the hi^ 
ways, or forestalling — ^tolls — warranty, or a right of reclaiming TiUains who 
had absconded. The charter therefore conveys a right to hold Tarioua 
courts, and consequently to try, and receive idl mulcts arising tcom the 
several offences enumerated, which being generally redeemable by fine, 
produced considerable sums ; besides, what was perhaps of more import- 
ance, exemption from the vexations of the king's ofBoen.

Lord Jesus Christ's incarnation 944, in the first of the indio 
tion, and was written in letters of gold in the book of the 
Groipels, which he presented to the same church elegantlj 
adomedL Such great and prosperous successes, however, 
were obscured bj a melancholj death. A certain robber 
named Leo&, whom he had banished for his crimes, returning 
after six jears' absence totally unexpected, was sitting, on 
the feast of St. Augustine, the apostle of the English, and 
first archbishop of Canterbury, among the royal guests at 
PiK^e-church,* for on this day the English were wont to re- 
gale in commemoration of their first preacher ; by chance 
too, he was placed near a nobleman whom the king had con- 
descended to make his guest. This, while the others were 
eagerlj carousing, was perceiyed by the king alone ; when, 
hurried with indignation and impelled by fate, he leaped 
from the tabl^ caught the robber by the hair, and dragged 
him to the fioor ; but he secretly drawing a dagger from its 
sheath plunged it with all his force into the breast of the king 
as he lay upon him. Dying of the wound, he gave rise oyer 
the whole kingdom to many fictions concerning his decease. 
The robber was shortly torn limb from limb by the attend- 
ants who rushed in, though he wounded some of them ere 
they could accomplish their purpose. St. Dunstan, at that 
time abbat of Glastonbury, had foreseen his ignoble end, 
being fully persuaded of it from the gesticulations and inso- 
lent mockery of a deyil dancing before him. Wherefore, 
hastening to court at full speed, he receiyed intelligence of 
the transaction on the road. By common consent then it 
was determined, that his body should be brought to Glaston- 
bury and there magnificently buried in the northern part of 
the tower. That such had been his intention, through his 
nngular regard for the abbat, was eyident from particular 
circumstances. The yillage also where he was murdered 
was made an offering for the dead, that the spot which had 
witnessed his fall might eyer after minister aid to his soul. 

In his fourth .year, that is, in the year of our Lord 944, 
William, the son of Rollo, duke of Normandy, was treacher- 
ously killed in France, which old writers relate as having 
been done with some degree of justice. Rinulph, one of the 
Norman nobility, owing William a grudge fh>m some un-

known cause, harassed him with perpetual aggressions. His 
son, Anschetily who served under the earl, to gratify his lord 
durst offer violence to nature for taking his father in bat* 
tie : he delivered him into the power of the earl, relying on 
the most solemn oath, that he should suffer nothing beyond 
imprisonment. As wickedness, however, constantly dis- 
covers pretences for crime, the earl, shortly after feigning an 
excuse, sends Anschetil to Pavia bearing a letter to the 
duke of Italy, the purport of which was his own destructaon. 
Completing his journey, he was received, on his entrance 
into the city, in the most respectful manner ; and delivering 
the letter, the duke, astonished at the treachery, shuddered, 
that a warrior of such singular address should be ordered to 
be despatched. But as he would not oppose the request of 
so renowned a nobleman, he laid an ambush of a thousand 
horsemen, as it is said, for Anschetil when he left the city. 
For a long time, with his companions whom he had selected 
out of all Normandy, he resisted their attack ; but at last he 
fell nobly, compensating his own death by slaying many of 
the enemy. The only survivor on either side was Balso, a 
Norman, a man of small size, but of incredible courage ; al- 
though some Say that he was ironically called short This 
man, I say, alone hovered round the city, and by his single 
sword terrified the townspeople as long as he thought pro- 
per. No person will deem this incredible, who considers 
what efforts the desperation of a courageous man will pro- 
duce, and how little military valour the people of that region 
possess. Returning thence to his own country, he laid his 
complaint of the perfidy of his lord before the king of France. 
Fame reported too, that Rinulph, in addition to his chains, 
had had his eyes put out. In consequence the earl being 
cited to his trisd at Paris, was met, under the pretence of a 
conference, as they assert, and killed by Balso ; tlius making 
atonement for his own perfidy, and satisfying the rage of his 
antagonist in the midst of the river Seine. His death was 
the source of long discord between the French and Normans, 
till by the exertions of Richard his son it had a termination 
worfhy such a personage. A truer liistory* indeed relates, 
that being at enmity with Ernulph, earl of Flanders, he had 
possessed himself of one of his castles, and that being invited

ODt by Yam to a conference, on a pretended design of making 
a trace, he was killed by Balso, as they were conversing in 
a ship t that a key was found at his girdle, which h&ng ap- 
plied to the lock of his priyate cabinet, discovered certain 
monastic habiliments;* for he ever designed, even amid his 
warlike pursuits, one day to become a monk at Jumi6ges ; 
which place, deserted £rGm the time of Hasten, he cleared 
of the overspreading thorns, and with princely magnificence 
exalted to its present state. 

In the year of our Lord 946, Edred, Edward's third son, 
assuming the government, reigned nine years and a half. 
He gave proof that he had not d^enerated in greatness of 
sonl from his father and his brothers ; for he nearly extermi- 
nated the Northumbrians and the Scots, laying waste the 
whole province with sword and famine, because, having with 
little difficulty compelled them to swear fidelity to him, they 
broke their oath, and made Iricius their king. He for a long 
time kept Wulstan, archbishop of York, who, it was said, 
comiived at the revolt of his countrymen, in chains, but 
ailterwards, out of respect to his ecclesiastical dignity, re- 
leased and pardoned him. In the meantime, the king him- 
self, prostrate at the feet of the saints, devoted his life to 
God and to Dunstan, by whose admonition he endured with 
patience his frequent bodily pains,t prolonged his prayers, 
and made his palace altogether the school of virtue. He 
died accompanied with the utmost grief of men, but joy of 
angels ; for Dunstan, learning by a messenger that he was 
sick, while urging his horse in order to see him, heard a 
voice thundering over his head, '* Now king Edred sleeps in 
the Lord.** He lies buried in the cathedral at Winchester. 

In the year of our Lord 955, Edwy, son of Edmund, the 
brother of Athelstan the former king, taking possession of 
the kingdom, retained it four years : a wanton youth, who 
abased the beauty of his person in illicit intercourse. Fi- 
nally, taking a woman nearly related to him as his wife, 
he doated on her beauty, and despised the advice of his coun-

sellors. On the verj day he had been consecrated king, in 
full assembly of the nobility, when deliberating on affairs of 
importance and essential to the state, he burst suddenly from 
amongst them, darted wantonly into his chamber, and rioted 
in the embraces of the harlot. AU were indignant of the 
shameless deed, and murmured among themselyes. Dunstan 
alone, with that firmness which his name implies,* regardless 
of the royal indignation, yiolently dragged the lasciyious boy 
from the chamber, and on the archbishop's compelling him 
to repudiate the strumpet,f made him his enemy for ever. 
Soon after, upheld by most contemptible supporters, he 
afflicted with undeserved calamities aU the members of the 
monastic order throughout England, — ^who were first de- 
spoiled of their property, and then driven into eidle. He 
(h*ove Dunstan himself, the chief of monks, into Flanders. 
At that time the face of monachism was sad and pitiable. 
Even the monastery of Malmesbury, which had been inha- 
bited by monks for more than two hundred and seventy 
years, he made a sty for secular canons. But thou, O 
Lord Jesus, our creator and redeemer, gracious disposer, art 
abundantly able to remedy our defects by means of those ir- 
regular and vagabond men. Thou didst bring to light thy 
treasure, hidden for so many years — ^I mean the body of St. 
Aldhelm, which they took up and placed in a shrine. The 
royal generosity increased the fame of the canons ; for 
the king bestowed on the saint an estate, very convenient 
both from its size and vicinity. But my recollection shud- 
ders even at this time, to think how cruel he was to other 
monasteries, equally on account of the giddiness of youth, 
and the pernicious counsel of his concubine, who was per- 
petually poisoning his uninformed mind. But let his soul,

CHAP. VXQ. 

Of king Edffor^ ton of king Edmund. [i..D. 959—975.] 

Ik the year of our Lord's incarnation 959, Edgar, the honour 
and dehght of the English, the son of Edmund, the brother 
of Edwy, a youth of sixteen years old, assuming the govern- 
ment, held it for about a similar period. The transactions of 
his reign are celebrated with peculiar splendour even in our 
times. The Divine love, which he sedulously procured by 
his derotion and energy of counsel, shone propitious on his 
years. It is commonly reported, that at his birth Dunstan 
heard an angelic voice, saying, '* Peace to England so long 
as this child shall reign, and our Dunstan survives." The 
succession of events was in unison with the heavenly oracle ; 
80 much while he lived did ecclesiastical glory flourish, and 
martial clamour decay. Scarcely does a year elapse in the 
chronicles, in which he did not perform something great and 
advantageous to his country ; in which he did not build 
some new monastery. He experienced no internal treachery, 
no foreign attack. Kinad, king of the Scots, Malcolm, of the 
Cambrians, that prince of pirates, Maccus, all the Welsh 
kings, whose names were Dufnal, Giferth, Huval, Jacob, 
Jadethil, being summoned to his court, were bound to him 
hj one, and that a lasting oath ; so that meeting him at 
Chester, he exhibited them on the river Dee in triumphal 
ceremony. For putting them all on board the same vessels 
he compelled them to row him as he sat at the prow : thus 
displaying his regal magnificence, who held so many kings 
in subjection. Indeed, he is reported to have said, that 
henceforward his successors might truly boast of being kings

of England, since thej would enjoy so singular an honour. 
Hence his fame being noised abroad, foreigners, Saxons, 
Flemings, and even Danes, frequentlj sailed hither, and 
were on terms of intimacy with Edgar, though their arrival 
was highly prejudicial to the natives : for from the Saxons 
they learned an untameable ferocity of mind ; from the Flem- 
ings an unmanly delicacy of body ; and from the Danes 
drunkenness ; though they were before free from such pro- 
pensities, and disposed to observe their own customs with 
native simplicity rather than admire those of others. For 
this history jusdy and deservedly blames him ; for the other 
imputations which I shaU mention hereafter have rather been 
cast on him by ballads. 

At this time the light of holy men was so resplendent in Eng- 
land, that you would believe the very stars from heaven smileid 
upon it. Among these was Dunstan, whom I have mentioned 
so frequently, first, abbat of Glastonbury ; next, bishop of 
Worcester ; and lastly, archbishop of Canterbu^ : of great 
power in earthly matters, in high favour with G-od ; in the 
one representing Martha, in the other Mary. Next to king 
Alfred, he was the most extraordinary patron of the liberal 
arts throughout the whole island ; the munificent restorer of 
monasteries ; terrible were his denunciations against trans- 
gressing kings and princes ; kind was his support of the 
middling and poorer classes. Indeed, so extremely anxious 
was he to preserve peace ever in trivial matters, that, as his 
countrymen used to assemble in taverns, and when a little 
elevated quarrel as to the proportions of their liquor, he or- 
dered gold OP silver pegs to be fastened in the pots, that 
whilst every man knew Us just measure, shame should com- 
pel each neither to take more himself, nor oblige others to 
drink beyond their proportional share. Osbeme,* precentor 
of Canterbury, second to none of these times in composition, 
and indisputably the best skilled of all in music, who wrote 
his life with Roman elegance, forbids me to relate farther 
praiseworthy anecdotes of him. Besides, in addition to this, 
if the divine grace shall accompany my design, I intend after 
the succession of the kings at least to particularize the names 
of all the bishops of each province in England, and to offer 
them to the knowledge of my countrymen, if I shall be able

to coin anTtbing worth notice out of the mintage of anti- 
quity. How powerful indeed the sanctity and virtue of 
Danstan's disciples were, is sufficiently evidenced by Ethel- 
wold, made abbat of Abingdon from a monk of Glastonbury, 
and afterwards bishop of Winchester, who built so many and 
such great monasteries, as to make it appear hardly credible 
how the bishop of one see should be able to effect what the 
king of England himself could scarcely undertake. I am 
deceived, and err through hasty opinion, if what I assert be 
not evident How great are the monasteries of Ely, Peter- 
borough, and Thomey, which he raised from the foundations, 
and completed by his industry ; which though repeatedly re- 
duced by the wickedness of plunderers, are yet sufficient for 
their inhabitants. His life was composed in a decent style 
by Wulstan,* precentor of Winchester, who had been his 
attendant and pupil : he wrote also another very useful work, 
" On the Harmony of Sounds," a proof that he was a learned 
Englishman, a man of pious life and correct eloquence. At 
that tame too Oswald, nephew of Odo, who had been arch- 
bishop before Dunstan, from a monk of Flory becoming bi- 
shop of -Worcester and archbishop of York, claimed equal 
honours with the others. Treading the same paths, he ex- 
tended the monastic profession by his authority, and built a 
monastery at Ramsey in a marshy situation. He filled the 
cathedral of Worcester with monks, the canons not being 
driven out by force, but circumvented by pious £raud.f 
Bishop Ethelwold, by the royal conmiand, had before ex- 
pelled the canons from Winchester, who, upon the king's 
living them an option either to live according to rule, or de- 
part Sie place, gave the preference to an easy life, and were 
at that time without fixed habitations wandering over the 
whole island. In this manner these three persons, illumina- 
ting England, as it were, with a triple light, chased away the 
thick darkness of error. In consequence, Edgar advanced 
the monastery of Glastonbury, which he ever loved beyond 
all others, with great possessions, and was anxiously vi^ant 

* Wulstan's Life of Ethelwold is printed by Mabillon, and in the Acta 
Sanctorum, Antwerp. Aug. tome i. 

t He erected another church at Worcester, in which he phiced monks. 
The canons finding the people desert them in order to obtain the ia?our of 
the new comers, by degrees took the monastic habit. See Malmesbuiy de

in all things pertaining either to the beautj or convenience 
of the church, whether intemallj or externally. It maj be 
proper here to subjoin to our narrative the charter he 
granted to the said church, as I have read it in their ancient 
chartulary.* 

* Some MSS. omit firom ** Eldgar of glorioiu memoiy, &c." to ''i^ken 
of another. The monastic order," &c. in page 155, and insert the charter 
at length, together with what follows it, thus : 

** In the name of our Lord Jesos Qurist : although the decrees of pon- 
tifis and the decisions of priests are fixed by irrevocable bonds, Uke the 
foundations of the mountains, vet, nevertheless, through the storms and 
tempests of secular matters, and the corruptions of reprobate men, the in> 
stitutions of the holy church of Grod are often convulsed and broken. 
Wherefore I perceive that it will be advantageous to posterity that I should 
confirm by writing what has been deteimineiil by wholesome counsel and 
common oonsent. In consequence, it seems proper that the church of the 
most blessed mother of God, the eternal virgin Mary, of Glastonbuiy, in- 
asmuch as it has always possessed the chief dignity in my kingdom, should 
be honoured by us with some especial and unusual privilege. Dunstan, 
therefore, and Oswald^ archbishops of Canterbury and York, exhorting 
thereto, and Brithelm, bishop of Wells, and other bishops, abbats, and 
chiefs assenting and approving, I, Edgar, by the grace of God, king of the 
English, and ruler and governor of the adjacent nations, in the name of the 
blessed Trinity, for the soul of my father who reposes there, and of my pre- 
decessors, do by this present pri^ege decree, appoint, and establish, thai 
the aforesaid monastery and all its possessions shall remain free and exone- 
rated from all payments to die Exchequer now and for ever : they shall have 
soc and sac, on stronde and on wude, on felde, on gxxthbrice, on bnrghrioei, 
hundredsetena, and mortheras, athas, and ordelas, ealle hordas bufan eor- 
than, and beneothan : infangenetheof, utfangenetheof, flemenefertha, ham- 
socne, friderbrice, foresteal, toll and team, just as fiee and peaceably as I 
have in my kingdom : let tiie same liberty and power also as I have m my 
own court, as well in forgiving as in puni^iing, and in every other matter, 
be possessed by the abbat and monks of the aforesaid monastery within 
their court. And should the abbat, or any monk of that place, upon his 
journey, meet a thief going to the gallows, or to any other punishmeDt of 
death, they shall have power of rescuing him from the impendiqg danger 
throughout my kingdom. Moreover, I confirm and establish what haa 
hitherto been scrupulously observed by all my predecessors^ that the bishop 
of Wells and his ministers shall have no power whatever over this monas- 
tery, or its parish-churches ; that is to say, Street, Miriding [Merfinge] * 
Budecal, Shapwick, Sovry, or their chapels, or even over those contained 
in the islands, that is to say, Beokery, otherwise called Little Ireland, God- 
ney, Maitensia, Patheneberga, Adredseia, and Ferramere, .except on! j 
when summoned by the abbat for dedications or ordinations, nor shall they 
cite their priests to their synods or chapters, or to any of their courts, nor 
shall they suspend them from their holy office, or presume to exercise any 
right over them whatever. The abbat shall cause any bishop of the same 
province he pleases to ordain his monks, and the clerks of the afixeeaid 



A.«i0711 XDGAI^B CHASTEB. 151 

"Ednr of gkniona memory, king of the Angles, son 
of king Edmund, whose inclinations were ever vigilantly 
bent on divine matters, often coming to the monastery of the 

dnirehei^ according to the ancient custom of the church of Glastonhuiy, 
and the apostolical authority of archbishop Dunstan, and of all the bishops 
of mj kiibzdom ; but the dedications of the churches we consign to the 
Usbop of Wells, if he be required by the abbot At Easter let him le- 
cciTe the chrism of sanctification, and the oil from the bishop of Wells, 
aoeofding to custom, and distribute them to bis before mentioned churches. 
This too I command above all other things : on the curse of God, and by 
my authority, saving the right of the holy Roman church, and that of 
Cantarfaury, I inhibit all persons, of whatever dignity, be they king, or 
lashop, or earl, or prince, or any of my dependants, from daring to enter 
the bounds of Glartonbuiy, or of the above named parishesi for the purpose 
of searching, seising, holding courts, or doing any thing to the prejudice of 
the servants of God there residing. The abbat and convent shall alone 
have power in causes known and unknown, in small and in great, and in 
every thing as we have before related. And whosoever, upon any occasion, 
whatever bie his dignity, whatever his order, whatever his profession, shall 
sttempt to pervert or nullify the pre-eminency of this my privilege by sacri- 
legious boldness, let him be aware that he must without a doubt give ac- 
count thereof, with fear and trembling, before a severe Judge, unless he 
fint endeavour to make reparation by proper satisfaction." The charter 
of this privilege the aforesaid king Edgar coniirmed by his own signature at 
London, in the twelfth year of bis reign, with the common consent of his 
nobles ; and in the same year, which was the 965th of our Lord's incarna- 
tion, and the 14th of the indiction, pope John, in a general assembly, au- 
thorized it at Rome, and made all the men of chief dignity who presided 
at that council confirm it ; and also, from motives of paternal regard, sent 
a letter to the following effect to earl Alfric, who was then grievously per- 
secuting the aforesaid church : — 

^ Bishop John, servant of the servants of God, to Alfric the distinguished 
esri, and our dearly beloved son in the Spirit, perpetual health and apos- 
toliosl benediction. We have learned, from the report of certain faithful 
people, that you commit many enormities against the church of the holy 
mother of God, called Mary of Glastonbury, which is acknowledged to b<v- 
loQg solely to, and to be under the protection of, the Roman Pontiff, from 
the earliest times ; and that you have seized with boundless rapacity upon 
its estates and posKssions, and even the churches of Brent and Pilton, 
which, by the gift of king Ina, it legally possesses, together with other 
ehurchea* that is to say, Sowy, Hartine, Budecal, Shapwick, and that on 
account of your near residence you are a continual enemy to its interests. 
It would, however, have been becoming, from your living so near, that by 
your assistance the holy church of God might have been much benefited 
and enriched ; but, horrible to say ! it is impoverished by your hostility, 
and injured by your deeds of oppression ; and since we doubt not that we, 
though unworthily, have received from St. Peter the apostle the care of all 
the churches, and solicitude for all things ; we therefore admonish your 
affection, to abstain from plundering it, for the love of the apostles Peter

holy mother of God at Glastonbury, and stadying to hononr 
this place with dignity superior to others> hath by the com- 
mon consent of the bishops, abbats, and nobility, conferred 
on it many and very splendid privileges ; — the first of which 
is, that no person, unless a monk of that place, shall there be 
abbat, either in name or in office, nor any other, except such 
us the common consent of the meeting shall have chosen ac- 
cording to the tenor of the rule« But should necessity bo 
ordain, that an abbat or monk of another numastery be made 
president of this place, then he deems it proper that none 
shaU be appointed, but such as the congregati(m of the mo- 
nastery may elect, to preside over them in the fear of the 
Lord ; nor shall this be done, if any, even the lowest of the 
congregation, can be there found fit for the office. He hath 
appointed too^ that the election of their abbat shall rest for 
ever in the mcmks^ reserving only to himself and his heirs 
the power of giving the pastoral staff to the elected brother. 
He hath ordained also, that so often as the abbat or the 
monks of this place shall appoint any of their society to be 
dignified with holy orders^ they shall cause any l»shop 
canonically ordained, either in his own cathedral, or in the 
monastery of St. Mary at Glastonbury, to ordain such monks 
and clerks as they deem fit to the church of St Mary. He 
hath granted moreover, that as he himself decides in his own 
dominions, so the abbat or the convent shall decide the causes 
of their entire island,* in all matters ecclesiastical or 
secular, without the contradiction of any one. Nor shall it 
be lawful for any person to enter that island which hore wit- 
ness to his birth, whether he be bishops duke, or prince, or 
person of whatever order, for the purpose of there doing any 
thing prejudicial to the servants of God : this he forbids al- 
togeth^, in the same manner as his predecessors have sanc- 
tioned and confirmed by their privileges ; that is to say, 
Kentwin, Ina, Ethelard, Cuthred, Alfred, Edward, Athd- 
Stan, and Edmund. When, therefore, by the common con- 

and Paul, and reaped to us, invading none of its poaaenon^ chnrebo, 
chapela, places, and estates ; but if you persist, remember, that by the au^ 
thority of the chief of the apostles, committed unto us, you shall be ex- 
communicated and banished from the company of the fiuthful, subjected 
to a perpetual curse, and doomed to etenud fire with the traitor Judas."

sent^ as has been said, of his prelates, abbats, and nobilitj, 
he determined to grant these privileges to the place afore- 
said, he laid his own horn, beautifallj formed of ivorj and 
adorned with gold, npon the altar of the holj mother of God, 
and hj that donation confirmed them to the same holy mo- 
ther of God, and her monks, to be possessed for ever. 
Soon after he caused this horn to be cut in two in his pre- 
sence, that no future abbat might give or sell it to any one, 
commanding part of it to be kept upon the spot for a testi- 
mony of the foresaid donation. Recollecting, however, how 
great is the temerity of human inconstancy, and on whom it 
is likely to creep, and fearing lest any one hereafter should 
attempt to take away these privileges from this place, or 
eject the monks, he sent this charter of royal liberality to 
the renowned lord, pope John, who had succeeded Octavian 
in the honour of the pontificate, begging him to corroborate 
these grants by an apostolical bull. Kindly receiving the 
legation, the pope, with the assenting voice of the Roman 
council, confirmed what had been already ordained, by wri- 
ting an apostolical injunction, terribly hurling on the viola- 
tors of them, should any be so daring, the vengeance of a 
perpetual curse. This confirmation therefore of the afore- 
said pope, directed to the same place, king Edgar, of worthy 
memory, laid upon the altar of the holy mother of God for a 
perpetual remembrance, commanding it to be carefully kept 
in future for the information of posterity. We have judged 
it proper to insert both these instruments, lest we should be 
supposed to invent such things against those persons who 
seek to enter into the fold of St. Mary, not like shepherds, by 
the door, but like thieves and robbers, some other way. ^' Be 
it known to all the faithful, that I, John the twelfth, through 
the mercy of God unworthy pope of the holy Roman See, 
am intreated by the humble request of the noble Edgar, king 
of the Angles, and of Dunstan, archbishop of the holy church 
of Canterbury, for the monastery of St. Mary, Glastonbury ; 
which, induced by the love of the heavenly King, they have 
endowed with many great possessions, increasing in it the mo- 
nastic order, and having confirmed it by royal grant, they pray 
me abo so to do. Wherefore assenting to their affectionate 
request, I take that place into the bosom of the Roman 
church, and the protection of the holy apostles, and support

and confirm its immuiiities as long as it shall remain in the 
same conyentual order in which it now flourishes. The 
monks shall have power to elect their own superior ; ordina- 
tion, as well of monks as of clerks, shall be at the wiH of the 
abbat and convent. We ordain, moreover, that no person 
shall have liberty to enter this island, either to hold ooorts, 
to make inquiry, or to correct ; and should any one attempt 
to oppose this, or to take away, retain, diminish, or harass 
with vexatious boldness, the possessions of the same church, 
he shall become liable to a perpetual curse, by the authority 
of Grod the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, the holy mother a£ 
Grod, the holy apostles Peter and Paul, and all saints, unless 
he recant. But the peace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with 
all who maintain the rights of the place aforesaid. Amen. 
And let this our deed remain unshaken. Done in the time of 
Edward, abbat of the said monastery." The aforesaid king 
Edgar confirmed these things at London, by his solemn char> 
ter, in the twelfth year of his reign ; and in the same year, 
that is, of our Lord 965,* the pope aforesaid allowed them in 
a general synod at Rome, and commanded aU members of 
superior, dignity who were present at the said general coun- 
cil, to confirm them likewise. Let the despisers then of so 
terrible a curse consider well what an extensive sentence of 
exconmiunication hangs over their heads : and indeed to St 
Peter the apostle, the chief of apostles, Christ gave the ofiice 
either of binding or loosing, as well as the keys of the king- 
dom of heaven. But to all the faithful it must be plain and 
evident, that the head of the Roman church must be the 
vicar of this apostle, and the immediate inheritor of his 
power. Over this church then John of holy memory lauda- 
bly presided in his lifetime, as he lives to this day in glorious 
recollection, promoted thereto by the choice of Grod and of 
all the people. If then the ordinance of St Peter the apos- 
tle be binding, consequently that of John the pope must be so 
likewise ; but not even a madman would deny the ordinance 
of Peter the apostle to be binding, consequently no one in his 
sober senses can say that the ordinance of John the pope is 
invalid. Either, therefore, acknowledging fiie power con- 
ferred by Christ on St Peter and his successors, they will 
abstain from transgressing against the authority of so dread-

faL an interdict^ or ebe contemning it^ the7 wi]]y with the 
devil and his angels, bring upon themselves the eternal dura- 
tion of the corse afore¥mtten. In consequence, it is mani- 
fest that no stranger ever seized this monastery for himself, 
who did not, as shall appear, disgracefully lose it again ; and 
that this occurred, not by any concerted plan of the monks, 
but by the judgment of God, for the avenging his holy au- 
thority. Wherefore let no man reading this despise it, nor 
make himaftlf conspicuous by bdng angry at it ; for should 
he, perhaps he will confess that to be said of himself which 
was designed to be spoken of another. The monastic order, 
for a long time depressed, now joyfully reared its head, and 
hence it came to pass that our monastery also resumed its 
ancient liberties : but this I think will be more suitably rela- 
ted in the words of the king himself. 

** I, Edgar, king of all Albion, and exalted, by the subjec- 
tion of the surrounding kings maritime or insular, by the 
bountiful grace of God, to a degree never enjoyed by any of 
my progenitors, have often, mindful of so high an honour, 
dOigently considered what offering I should more especially 
make from my earthly kingdom, to the King of kings. In 
aid of my pious devotion, heavenly love- suddenly insinuated 
to my watchful solicitude, that I should rebuild all the holy 
monasteries throughout my kingdom, which, as they were 
outwardly ruinous, with mouldering shingles and worm-eaten 
boards, even to the rafters, so, what was still worse, they had 
become internally neglected, and almost destitute of the ser- 
vice of Grod ; wherefore, ejecting those illiterate clerks, sub- 
ject to the discipline of no regular order, in many places I 
have appointed pastors of an holier race, that is, of the mon- 
astic order, supplying them vnth ample means out of my 
royal revenues to repair their churches wherever ruinated. 
One of these pastors, by name Elfric, in all things a true 
priest, I have appointed guardian of that most celebrated 
monastery which the Angles call by a twofold name Mald- 
elmes-burgh. To which, for the benefit of mv soul, and in 
honour of our Saviour, and the holy mother of Grod the vir- 
gin Mary, and the apostles Peter and Paul, and the amiable 
prelate Aldhelm, I have restored, with munificent liberality, 
a portion of land : and more especially a piece of ground,* 

* Here is 9n omiisioii, apparently, which may be supplied from the Ang.

with meadows and woods. This, leased out bj the aforesaid 
priesty was unjustly held by the contentious Edehiot ; but his 
vam and subtle disputation being heard by my counsel- 
lors, and his false defence being, in my presence, nullified, 
by them, I have restored it to the use of the monastery in 
the year of our Lord 974, in the fourteenth of my reign, and 
the first of my royal consecration." 

And here I deem it not irrelevant to commit to writing 
what was supematurally shown to the king. He had entered 
a wood abundant in game, and, as usually happens, while his 
associates were dispersed in the thicket for the purpose of hunt- 
ing, he was left alone. Pursuing his course, he came to the out- 
let of the wood, and stopping there waited for his companions. 
Shortly after, seized with an irresistible desire to sleep, he 
alighted &om his hbrse, that the enjojment of a short re- 
pose might assuage the fatigue of the past day. He lay 
down, therefore, under a wild apple-tree, where the cluster- 
ing branches had formed a shady canopy all around. A 
river, flowing softly beside him, adding to his drowsiness, by its 
gentle murmur soothed him to sleep ; when a bitch, of the 
hunting breed, pregnant, and lying down at his fee^ terri- 
fied him in his slunib^^. Though the mother was sil^at, 
yet the whelps within her womb barked in various sonorous 
tones, incited, as it were, by a singular delight in the place 
of their confinement Astonished at this prodigy, as he 
lifted up his eyes towards the summit of the tree, he saw, 
first one apple, and then another, fall into the river, by the 
collision of which, the watery bubbles being put in commo- 
tion, a voice articulately sounded, '^Well is thee." Soon 
after, driven by the rippling wave, a little pitcher appeared 
ui>on the stream, and after that a larger vessel, oversowing 
with water, for the former was empty : and although by the 
violence of the stream the greater vessel pressed upon the 
lesser that it might discharge its waters into it ; yet it ever 
happened that the pitcher escaped, still empty, and again, as 
in a haughty and insulting manner, attacked the laiger. Re- 
turning home, as the Psalmist says, '' He thought upon what 
had been done, and sought out lus spirit." His mother ad- 
dressed him, however, that she might cheer both his counte-

nance and his heart ; saying, it should be her care to entreat 
Grod, who knew how to explain mysteries by the light of his 
inspiration. With this admonition he dispelled his grief and 
dismissed his anxiety, conscious of his mother's sanctity, to 
whom God had vouchsafed many revelations. Her name 
was Elfgiva, a woman intent on good works, and gifted with 
such affection and kindness, that she would even secretly 
discharge the penalties of those culprits whom the sad sen- 
tence of the judges had publicly condemned. That costly 
clothing, which, to many women, is the pander of vice, was 
to her the means of liberality ; as she would give a garment 
of the most beautiful workmanship to the first poor person 
she saw. Even malice itself, as there was nothing to carp at, 
might praise the beauty of her person and the work of her 
hands. Thoroughly comprehending the presage, she said 
to her son next morning, ** The barlung of the whelps while 
the mother was sleeping, implies, that after your death, those 
persons who are now living and in power, dying also, mis- 
creants yet unborn will bark against the church of God. 
And whereas one apple followed the other, so that the voice, 
' Well is thee,' seemed to proceed from the dashing of the 
second against the first, this implies that from you, who are 
now a tree shading all England, two sons will proceed ; the 
&TOurers of the second will destroy the first, when the 
chiefs of the different parties will say to each of the boys, 
* Well is thee,' because the dead will reign in heaven, the 
living on earth. Forasmuch as the greater pitcher could not 
fin the smaller, this signifies, that the Northern natioDR, 
which are more numerous than the English, shall attack 
England aflter your death ; and, although they may recruit 
their deficiencies by perpetual supplies of their countrymen, 
yet they shall never be able to fill this Angle of the world, 
but instead of that, our Angles, when they seem to be com- 
pletely subjugated, shall drive them out, and it shall remain 
under its own and God's governance, even unto the time be- 
fore appointed by Christ. Amen." 

Farther perusal will justify the truth of the presage. The 
manifest sanctity both of parent and child ought here to be 
considered ; that the one should see a mystery when broad 
awake without impediment, and that the other should be able 
to solve the problem by the far-discerning eye of prophecy. 



158 WILLIAM OF MALMfiSBTTBT. La^n.cS. 

The rigour of Edgar's justice was equal to the sanctitj of 
his mazmersy so that he permitted no person, be his dignity 
what it might, to elude the laws with impunity. In his time 
there was no private thief, no public freebooter, unless such 
as chose to risk the loss of Hfe for their attacks upon the 
property of others.* How, indeed, can it be supposed that 
he would pass oyer the crimes of men when he designed to ex- 
terminate every beast of prey from his kingdom ; and com- 
manded Judwall, king of the Welsh, to pay him yearly a 
tribute of three hundred wolves? This he performed for 
three years, but omitted in the fourth, declaring that he 
could find no more. 

Although it is reported that he was extremely small both 
in stature and in bulk, yet nature had condescended to en- 
close such strength in that diminutive body, that he would 
voluntarily challenge any person, whom he knew to be bold 
and valiant, to engage with him, and his greatest apprehen- 
sion was, lest they should stand in awe of him in these 
encounters. Moreover, at a certain banquet, where ihe 
prating of coxcombs generally shows itself very freely, it is 
reported that Kinad, king of the Scots, said in a sportive 
manner, that it seemed extraordinary to him how so many 
provinces should be subject to such a sorry little fellow. This 
was caught up with malignant ear by a certain minstrel, and 
afterwards cast in Edgar's teeth, with the customary raillery 
of such people. But he, concealing the circumstance from 
his friends, sent for Kinad, as if to consult him on some 
secret matter of importance, and leadiiig him aside far 
into the recesses of a wood, he gave him one of two swords, 
which he had brought with him. " Now," said he, '* as we are 
alone, I shall have an opportunity of proving your strength ; 
I will now make it appear which ought deservedly to com- 
mand the other ; nor shall you stir a foot till you try the 
matter with me, for it is disgraceful in a king to prate at a 
banquet, and not to be prompt in action." Confused, and 
not daring to utter a word, he fell at the feet of his sovereign 

» Edgar's laws for the punishment of offenders were honibly severe. The 
eyes were put out, nosbrUs slit, ears torn off, hands and feet cut off, and, 
finally, after the scalp had been torn off, the miserable wretches were left 
exposed to birds or beasts of prey. Y. Acta Sanctor. Jul. 2, in Vita

lordy and asked pardon for what was merely a joke ; which 
he immediately obtained. But what of this ? Every sum- 
mer, as soon as the festival of Easter was passed, he ordered 
his ships to be collected on each coast ; cruising to the west- 
em part of the island with the eastern fleet ; and, dismissing 
that^ with the western to the north ; and then again with 
the northern squadron towards the east, carefully vigilant 
lest pirates should disturb the country. During the winter 
and spring, travelling through the provinces, he made inquiry 
nto the decisions of men in power, severely avenging violated 
laws^ by the one mode advancing justice, by the other military 
strengUi ; and in both consulting public utility. There are 
8c»ne persons, indeed, who endeavour to dim his exceeding 
glory by saying, that in his earlier years he was cruel to his 
subjects, and libidinous in respect of virgins. Their first 
accusation they exemplify thus. There was, in his time, 
one Athelwold, a nobleman of celebrity and one of his con- 
fidants. The king had commissioned him to visit Elfthrida^ 
daughter of Ordgar, duke of Devonshire, (whose charms had 
80 fSeuKdnated the eyes of some persons that they commended 
her to the king), and to offer her marriage, if her beauty 
were really equfd to report Hastening on his embassy, and 
finding everything consonant to general estimation, he con- 
cealed his mission firom her parents and procured the damsel 
for himself. Returning to the king, he told a tale which 
made for his own purpose ; that she was a girl nothing out 
of the common track of beauty, and by no means worthy 
such transcendent dignity. When Edgar's heart was disen- 
gaged from this affair, and employed on other amours, some 
tattlers acquainted him, how completely Athelwold had 
duped him by his artifices. Paying him in his own coin, that 
is, returning him deceit for deceit, he showed the earl a fair 
countenance, and, as in a sportive manner, appointed a 
day when he would visit his far-famed lady. Terrified, 
almost to death, with this dreadful pleasantry, he hastened 
before to his wife, entreating that she would administer to 
his safety by attiring herself as unbecomingly as possible : 
then first disclosing the intention of such a proceeding. 
But what did not this woman dare ? She was hardy enough 
to deceive the confidence of her first lover, her first husband ; 
to. call up every charm by art, and to omit nothing which

ooold Stimulate the desire of a young and powerful man. 
Nor did events happen contrary to her design. For he fell 
so desperately in love with her the moment he saw her, that, 
dissembling his indignation^ he sent for the earl into a wood 
at Warewelle,* called Harewood, under pretence of hunting, 
and ran him through with a javelin : and when the illegiti*» 
mate son of the murdered nobleman approached with his ac- 
customed familiarity, and was asked by the king how be 
liked that kind of sport, he is reported to have said, *' Well^ 
my sovereign liege, I ought not to be displeased with that 
which gives you pleasure.** This answer so assuaged the 
mind of the raging monarch, that, for the remainder of his 
life, he held no one in greater estimation than this young 
man ; mitigating the offence of his tyrannical deed against 
the father, by royal solicitude for the son. In expiation of 
this crime, a monastery which was built on the spot by 
Elfthrida is inhabited by a large congregation of nuns. 

To this instance of cruelty, they add a second of lust. 
Hearing of the beauty of a certain virgin, who was dedicated 
to God, he carried her off from a monastery by force, ravish- 
ed her, and repeatedly made her the partner of his bed. 
When this circumstance reached the ears of St. Dunstan, he 
was vehemently reproved by him, and underwent a seven 
years' penance ; though a king, submitting to fast and to 
forego the wearing of his crown for that period.f They add 
a third, in which both vices may be discovered. King Edgar 
coming to Andover, a town not far from Winchester, ordered 
the daughter of a certain nobleman, the fame of whose beauty 
had been loudly extolled, to be brought to him. The mother 
of the young lady, shocked at the proposed concubinage of 
her daughter, assisted by the darkness of night placed an 
attendant in his bed ; a maiden indeed neither deficient in 
elegance nor in understanding. The night having passed, 
when aurora was hastening into day, the woman attempted to 
rise ; and being asked, ^' why in such haste 7* she replied, 
" to perform the daily labour of her mistress.'' Retained 
though with difficulty, on her knees she bewailed her 
wretched situation to the king, and entreated her freedom as

pitjto the girl, and displeasure to her mistress, he^ at last, as 
if treating ike whole aa a j<^e, released her from servitude,

nilting how they fiked it, loved her entirely, nor left her bed 
tin he to(^ Elfthrida, the dav^hter dT Ordgar, to be his legiti- 
mate wife. Blfthrida bore him Edmund, who dying five 
yean before his fi&ther, lies buried at Romsey, and Ethelred, 
who reigned after him. Besides, of Egelfleda, sumamed 
the fair, the daughter of the most poweiful duke, Ordmer, 
be b^t Edward ; and St. Editha of Wulfritha, who it is 
certain was not a nun at that ^ime, but being a lay virgin 
had assumed the veil through fear of the king, though she 
was immediately afterwards forced to the royal bed ; on 
which, St Danstan, offended that he should desire lustfully a 
person who had been even the semblance of a nun, exerted 
the pontifidd power againait him. But however these things 
may be, liiis is certain, that from the sixteenth year of his 
^ when he was appointed king, till the thirtieth, he reigned 
without the insignia of royalty ; for at that time, the princes 
ud men of every order assembling generally, he was crowned 
with great pomp at Bath, survived only three years, and was 
boned at Glastonbury. Nor is it to be forgotten, that when 
>bbat Ailward opened his tomb in the year of our Lord 
1052, he fbimd the body unconscious of corruption ; which 
instead of inclining him to reverence, served only to in- 
<:rea8e his audacity. For when the receptacle which he had 
Prepared, seemed too small to admit the body, he profaned 
^ royal corpse by cutting it. Whence the blood imme- 
diately gushing out in torrents, shook the hearts of the by* 
Btanders with horror. In consequence his royal remains 
^'^fe placed upon the altar in a shrine, which he Had him-

«nd the relics of Vincent the martyr ; which purchased, at 
^ great price, he had added to the beauty of the house of 
God. The violator of the sacred body presently became dis-

tracted, and not long after, going oat of the cburch, met his 
death by a broken neck. Nor did the display of royal 
sanctity stop thus ; it proceeded still further, a man, Innatic 
and blind, being there cored. Deservedly then does the re- 
port prevail among the English, that no king, either of hia 
own or former times in England, could be justly and fairly 
compared to Edgar : for nothing could be more holy than 
his life, nothing more praiseworthy than his justice ; those 
vices excepted which he afterwards obliterated by abundant 
virtues : a man who rendered his country illustrious throagh 
his distinguished courage, and the brilliancy of his acticma, 
as well as by the increase of the servants of God. After hia 
departure, the state and the hopes of the English met with 
a melancholy reverse.* 

CHAP. IX. 

Of St, Edward king and martyr the ton qf Edgar. [a.d. 975 — ^978.] 

In the year of our Lord 975, Edward the son of Edgar be- 
gan to reign, and enjoyed the sovereignty for three yean 
and a half. Dunstan, in common consent with the other 
bishops, elevated him to the royal dignity, in opposition, as it is 
said, to the will of some of the nobOity, and of his st^- 
mother ; who was anxious to advance her son Ethelred, a 
child scarcely seven years of age, in order that herself might 
govern under colour of his name. Then, from the increasing 
malice of men, the happiness of the kingdom was impaired ; 
then too, comets were seen, which were asserted certainly 
to portend either pestilence to the inhabitants, or a change in 
the government. Nor was it long ere there followed a 
scarcity of com ; famine among men ; murrain among cattle; 
and an extraordinary accident at a royal town called Calne. 
For as soon as Edgar was dead, the secular canons who had 
been for some time expelled their monasteries, rekindled the 
former feuds, alleging, that it was a great and serious dis- 
grace, for new comers to drive the ancient inmates from their 
dwellings ; that it could not be esteemed grateful to €rod, 
who had granted them their ancient habitations : nether 
could it be so to any considerate man, who might dread that

mjostice as likely to befall liimselfy which he had seen over- 
take others. Henoe they proceeded to damoar and rage, and 
hastened to Dunstan ; the principal people, as is the custom 
of the laity, exclaiming more especially, that the injury 
which the canons had wrongfully suffered, ought to be re- 
dieaaed by gentler measures. Moreover, one of them, Elfe- 
rios, with more than common audacity, had even overturned 
ahnost all the monasteries which that highly revered monk 
Ethelwold, bishop of Winchester, had buUt throughout Mer« 
da. On this account a fuU synod being convened^ they first 
assembled at Winchester. What was the issue of the contest 
of that place, other writings declare ;* relating, that the 
image of our Saviour, speaking decidedly, confounded the 
canons and their party. But men's minds being not yet at 
rest on the subject, a council was called at Cidne ; where, 
when all the senators of England, the king being absent on 
account of his youth, had assembled in an upper chamber, 
and the business was agitated with much animosity and de- 
bate ; while the weapons of harsh reproach were directed 
against that firmest bulwark of the church, I mean Dunstan, 
bat conld not shake it; and men of every rank were earnestly 
defending their several sides of the question ; the floor with 
its beams and supporters gave way suddenly and fell to the 
ground. All fell with it except Dunstan, who alone escaped 
unhurt by standing on a single rafter which retained its posi- 
tion : the rest were either killed, or subjected to lasting in- 
firmity. This miracle procured the archbishop peace on the 
score of the canons ; all the English, both at that time and 
afterwards, yielding to his sentiments. 

Meanwhile king Edward conducted himself with becoming 
affection to his infant brother and his step-mother ; he retained 
only the name of king, and gave them the power ; following 
the footsteps of his father's piety, and giving both his attention 
and his heart to good council The woman, however, with 
that hatred which a step-mother only can entertain, began to 
meditate a subtle stratagem, in order that not even the title 
of king might be wanting to her child, and to lay a treacher-

following oumner. He was returning home^ tired with ike 
ohass and gasping with thirst from the exercise, while his 
companions were following the dogs in difierent directions 
as it happened, when hearing that thej dwelt in. a neighhonr- 
ing mansion, the youth proceeded thither at full speed, un- 
attended and unsuspecting, as he judged of others by his own 
feelings. On his arrival, alluring him to her with female 
blandishment, she made him lean forward, and after saluting 
him while he was eagerly drinking from the cup which had been 
presented, the dagger of an attendant pierced him through. 
Dreadfully wounded, with all his remaining strength he 
clapped spurs to his horse in order to join his companions ; 
when one foot slipping, he was dragged by the other through 
the trackless paths and recesses of the wood, while the stream- 
ing blood gave evidence of his death to his followers^ More- 
over, they then commanded him to be ingloriously interred 
at Wareham ; envying him even holy ground when dead, as 
they had envied hLm his royal dignity while living. They 
now publicly manifested their extreme joy as if they had 
buried his memory with his body ; but God's aU-seeing eye 
was there, who ennobled the innocent victim by the glory 
of miracles. So much is human outweighed by heavenly 
judgment. For there lights were shown from above ; there 
the lame walked ; there the dumb resumed his faculty of 
spe^h ; there every malady gave way to health. The fame 
of this pervading fdl England, proclaimed the merits of the 
martyr. The murderess excited by it, attempted a i»t)gress 
thither ; and was already urging forward the horse she had 
mounted, when she perceived the manifest anger of God ; 
for the same creature which she had heretofore constantly 
ridden, and which was used to outstrip the very wind in 
speed, now by command of Gt)d, stood motionless. The 
attendants, both with whips and clamours, urged him forward 
that he might carry his noble mistress with his usual readi- 
ness ; but their labour was in vain. They changed the 
horse ; and the same circumstance recurred* Her obdurate 
heart, though late, perceived the meaning of the miracle ; 
wherefore, what she was not herself permitted to do^ she

ing of his rashness, and being deeply distressed in mind, took 
Qp the sacred corpse from its unworthy barial-place, and paid 
it just and distinguished honours at Shaftesbury. He did not 
«cape unpunished, however, for, within a year afterwards, 
he was eaten of the vermin which we call Uce. Moreover, 
nnce a mind unregulated is a torment to itself, and a restless 
spirit endures its own peculiar punishment in this life, Elf- 
thrida declining from her regal pride, became extremely 
penitent ; so that at Werewefi, for many years, she clothed 
her pampered body in hair-cloth, slept at night upon the 
ground without a pillow ; and mortified her flesh with every 
kind of penance. She was a beautiful woman ; singularly 
faithful to her hosband ; but deserving punishment from the 
eommission of so great a crime. It is believed and commonly 
reported, that from her violence to Edward, the country for 
a long time after groaned under the yoke of barbarian ser- 
▼itade. 

At Shaftesbury, truly shines a splendid proof of royal 
nnctity ; fbr to Ms merit must it be attributed, that there a 
oomenms choir of women dedicated to God, not only en- 
lighten those parts with the blaze of their religion, but even 
reach the very heavens. There reside sacred virgins wholly 
anoonadous of contamination, there, continent widows, igno- 
nukt of a second flame after the extinction of the first ; in all 
whose manner, graceful modesty is so blended with chastened 
elegance, thai nothing can exceed it. Indeed it is matter 
of doabt which to applaud most, their assiduity in the service 
of God or their affability in their converse with men : hence 
ttsent is justly given to those persons who say that, the world, 
which has long tottered with the weight of its sins, is entirely 
supported by their prayers. 

CHAP. X. 

Of king Eihelrsd and king Edmund, [a*d. 979^1017.] 

Iif the year of our Lord's incarnation 979, Ethelred, son of 
Edgar and Elfthrida, obtaining the kingdom, occupied, rather 
thai governed it for thirty-seven years. The career of his 
life is said to have been cruel in the beginning, wretched in 
the middle, and disgraceful in the end. Thus, in the murder 
to which he gave his concurrence, he was cruel ; base in his

flighty and efieminacy ; miserable in his death. Danstan, 
indeed, had foretold his worthlessness, having discovered it 
by a very filthy token : for when quite an infant, the bishops 
standing round, as he was immeriBed in the baptismal font, 
he defiled the sacrament by a natural evacuation : at which 
'Dunstan, being extremely angered, exclaimed, '^By Gk>d, 
and his mother, this will be a sorry fellow." I have read, 
that when he was ten years of age, hearing it noised abroad 
that his brother was killed, he so irritated his furious mother 
by his weeping, that not having a whip at hand, she beat the 
little innocent with some candles she had snatched up : nor 
did she desist, till herself bedewed him, nearly lifeless^ with her 
tears. On this account he dreaded candles during the rest of 
his life, to such a degree that he would never suffer the light 
of them to be brought into his presence. The nobility being 
assembled by the contrivance of his mother, and Uie day 
appointed for Dunstan, in right of his see, to crown him, 
he, though he might be ill-affected to them, forbore to resist, 
being a prelate of mature age, and long versed in secular 
matters. But, when placing the crown on his head he ooold 
not refrain from giving vent with a loud voice, to that pro- 
phetic spirit which he had so deeply imbibed. ^ Since,** 
said he, ^' thou hast aspired to the kingdom by the death of 
thy brother, hear the word of Grod ; thus saith the Lord 
God: the sin of thy abandoned mother, and of the accom- 
plices of her base design, shall not be washed out bat by 
much blood of the wretched inhabitants; and such evib 
shall come upon the EngUsh nation as they have never suf- 
fered from the time they came to England until then.** Nor 
was it long after, that is, in his third year, that seven pirati- 
cal vessels came to Southampton, a port near Winchester, 
and having ravaged the coast fled back to the sea: this I 
think right to mention because many reports are circulated 
among l^e EngUsh, concerning these vessels. 

A quarrel between the king and the bishop of Rochester 
had arisen from some unknown cause ; in consequence of 
which he led an army against that city. It was signified 
to him by the archbishop, that he should desist from his 
fury, and not irritate St. Andrew, under whose guardian- 
ship that bishopric was ; for as he was ever ready to pardon, 
so was he equally formidable to avenge. This simple mes-

8Sge being held in contempt, he graced the intimation with 
monej, and sent him a hundred pounds, as a bribe, that 
he should raise the siege and retire. He therefore took the 
money, retreated, and dismissed his armj. Dunstan, aston- 
ished at his aTariee, sent messengers to him with the follow- 
ing words, ** Since 70a have preferred silver to God, money 
to the apostle, and oovetousness to me ; the evils which God 
bas pronounced will shortly come upon you; but they will 
not come while I live, for this also hath God spoken." Soon 
after the death of this holy man, which was in the tenth 
jear of his reign, the predictions speedily began to be ful- 
filled, and the prophecies to have their consummation. For 
the Danes infested every port, and made descents on all 
sidee with great activity, so that it was not known where 
they oould be opposed. But Siric, the second archbishop 
after Dnnstan, advised that money should repel those whom 
the sword could not : thus a payment of ten thousand pounds 
aatiafied the avarice of the Danes. This was an infamous 
precedent, and totally unworthy the character of men, to 
redeem liberty, which no violence can ever extirpate from 
a noble mind, by money. They now indeed abstained a 
short time from their incursions ; but as soon as their 
strength was recruited by rest, they returned to their old 
practioes. Such extreme fear had seized the English, that 
there was no thought of resistance : if any indeed, mindful 
of theiT ancient glory, made an attempt to oppose, or engage 
them, they were unsuccessful, firom the multitude of their 
enemies, and the desertion of their allies. The leader of 
revolt was one Elfric, whom the king had appointed to 
command the fleet: he, instead of trying his fortune, as he 
ought, in a naval conflict, went over, on the night preceding 
the battle, a base deserter to the enemy, whom he had ap- 
prised, by messengers, what preparations to make ; and 
though the king, for this perfidious crime, ordered his 
son's eyes to be put out, yet he returned again, and again 
deserted. All Northumbria being laid waste, the enemy 
was met in battle and worsted. London was besieged, but 
honourably defended by its citizens. In consequence, the 
besiegers, after suffering severely and despairing of taking 
the city, retired ; and devastating the whole province to the 
eastward, compelled the king to pay a sum of money.

amoantiiig to sixteen thousand pounds. Moreoyery host- 
ages being given, he caused th^ king Anlaf to come to 
hun, stood for him at the font, and sooSiing him with lojal 
munificence bound him by an oath that he ahocdd nerer 
return into England again. The evil however was not thoB 
put to rest For thej could never provide against their 
enemies from Denmark, springing up afiresh, like the heads 
of the hydra. The |»rovince in the west of England, called 
Devonshire, was laid waste ; the monasteries destroyed ; and 
the city of Exeter set on fire : Kent was given up to plun- 
der ; the metropolitan dty and seat of the patriarchs, burnt ; 
the holy patriarch himself^ the most reverend Elph^^ carried 
away and bound in cludns: and at last, when required to 
plunder his tenants in order to ransom himself and refusing 
to do so, he was stoned, struck with a hatchet, and glorified 
heaven with his souL After he was murdered, God exalted 
him ; insomuch, "that when the Danes, who had been instru- 
mental to his death, saw that dead wood beuneared with his 
blood miraculously grew green again in one' night, they ran 
eagerly to kiss his remains, and to bear them on their shoul- 
ders. Thus they abated their usual pride, and suffered his 
sacred corpse to be carried to London. There it was honor- 
ably buried ; and when taken up, ten years afterwards, firee 
from every taint of corruption, it conferred honour on his 
cathedral at Canterbury.* To the present moment both its 
blood remains fresh, and its soundness unimpaired, and it is 
considered a miracle, that a carcass should be divested of 
life, and yet not decay. That I may not be tedious in 
mentioning severally all the |»x>vinces which the Danes 
laid waste, let it be briefly understood, that out of thirty- 
two counties, which are reckoned in England, they had id- 
ready overrun sixteen; the names of which I forbear to 
enumerate on account of the harshness of the language. 
In the meantime, the king, admirably calculated for sleq>- 
ing, did nothing but postpone and hesitate, and if ever he 
recovered his senses enough to raise him^lf upon his elbow, 
he quickly relapsed into his original wretchedness, either 
from the oppression of indolence, or the adverseness of for- 
time. His brother's ghost also^ demanding dire expiation, 
tormented him. Who can tell how often he coUected his

vrmj ? how often lie ordered ships to be built ? how fre- 
quently he called out commanders from all quarters ? and 
jet nothing was ever effected. For the army, destitute of 
a lesder and ignorant of military discipline, either retreated 
before it came into action, or else was easily oyercome. 
The presence of the leader is of much avail in battle; 
ocmmge manifested by him avails also ; experience, and 
more especially, discipline avail much; and as I have said, 
the want of these, in an army, must be an irreparable in- 
joiy to its countrymen, as well as a pitiable object of con- 
tempt to an enemy. For soldiers are a kind of men, who, 
if not restrained before the battle, are eag^ to plunder ; and 
if not animated during it, are prone to flight. When the 
ships, built for the defence of the sea-ooast, were lying at 
uchor, a tempest suddenly arising dashed them together, and 
rendered them useless by the destruction of their tackling: 
a few, fitted from the wrecks of the others, were, by the 
attack of one Wulnod, whom the king had banished, either 
rank, or burnt, and consequently disappointed the expecta- 
tions of all Cngland. The commanders, if ever they met 
to confer, immediately chose different sides, and rarely or 
never united in one good plan ; for they gave more attention 
to private quarrels, than to public exigences : and, if in the 
midst of pressing danger, they had resolved on any eligible 
Mcret design, it was immediately communicated to the Danes 
bj traitors. For besides Elfric, the successor of Elfere who 
had murdered the late king, there was one Edric, a man 
in&mously skilled in such transactions, whom the king had 
made governor of the Mercians. This fellow was the re- 
fose of mankind, the reproach of the English ; an abandoned 
glutton, a canning miscreant ; who had become opulent, not 
bj nobility, but by specious language and impudence. This 
ftrtful dissembler, capable of feigning anything, was accus- 
tomed, by pretended fidelity, to scent out the king's designs, 
that he might treacherously divulge them. Often, when 
despatched to the enemy as the mediator of peace, he in- 
flamed them to battle. His perfidy was sufficiently con- 
spicuous in this king's reign, but much more so in the next ; 
of which I shall have occasion to speak hereafter. Ulfkytel, 
^1 of the East Angles, was the only person who, at that 
time, resisted the invaders with any degree of spirit; inso-

much that although the enemy had nominallj the Tictoiy, 
yet the conquerors suffered much more than the conquered :* 
nor were the barbarians ashamed to confess this truth, while 
they so frequently bewailed that victory. The valour of the 
earl was more conspicuously eminent, after the death of 
Ethelred, in that batde which mowed down the whole flower 
of the province; where, when he was surrounded from the 
rear, deeming it disgraceful to fly, he gave fresh confidoice 
to the king by his blood; but this happened some tune 
after.f At this juncture, that the measure of king Ethelred's 
misery might be full, a £unine ravaged all England, and 
those whom war had spared perished from want. The 
enemy over-ran the country with such freedom, that th^ 
would carry off their booty to their ships through a space of 
fifty miles, without fearing any resistance from the inhabit- 
ants. In the midst of these pressing evils, the expedient of 
buying off hostilities by money was again debated and 
adopted ; for first twenty-four, and soon after, thirty thou- 
sand pounds were given to the Danes : with what advantage, 
succeeding times will show. To me, indeed, deeply reflect- 
ing upon the subject, it seems wonderful, how a man, as we 
have been taught to suppose, neither very foolish, nor exces- 
sively heartless, should pass his life in the wretched en- 
durance of so many calamities. Should any one ask me the 
reason of this, I could not easily answer, except by saying, 
that the revolt of the generals proceeded from the haughti- 
ness of fhe king. Their perfidy has been spoken of before: 
I now hasten to instances of his violence, which was so 
intolerable, that he spared not even his own relations. For, 
besides the English, whom he despoiled of their hereditary 
possessions without any cause, or defrauded of their property 
for supposititious crimes: besides the Danes, whom, from 
light suspicion only, he ordered to be all butchered on the 
same day throughout England ; which was a dreadful spec- 
tacle to behold; each one compelled to betray his dearest 
guests, now become dearer from the tenderest connexions of 

• Ulfkytel attacked the Danes near Thetford, a.d. 1004, and though 
compelled to retreat, yet occaflioned so severe a loss to the enemy, thai 
they are said to have acknowledged that they had never endured a more 
powerful attack. See Flor. Wigom., and the Saxon Chronicle, 4.D. 1004,

affinity, and to cut short their embraces with the sword : jet 
besides all this, I saj, he was so inconstant towards his wife, 
that he scarcely deigned her his bed, and degraded the royal 
dignity byhis intercourse with harlots. She too, a woman, 
oonscions of her high descent, became indignant at her hus- 
band, as she found herself endeared to him neither by her 
Uameless modesty nor her fruitfulness ; for she had borne 
him two children, Elfred and Edward. She was the daugh- 
ter of Richard, earl of Normandy, the son of William, who, 
after his father, presided oyer that earldom for fifty-two 
years, and died in the twenty-eighth year of this king. He 
Hes at the monastery of Fescamp, which he augmented with 
certain revenues, and which he adorned with a monastic 
order, by means of WOliam, formerly abbat of Dijon. Rich- 
ard was a distinguished character, and had also often 
harassed Ethelred : which, when it became known at Rome, 
the holy see, not enduring that two Christians should be at 
enmity, sent Leo, bishop of Treves, into England, to restore 
peace : the epistle describing this legation was as follows : — 
^' John the fifteenth, pope of the holy Roman church, to 
an faithful people, health. Be it known to all the faithful of 
the holy mother church, and our children spiritual and secu- 
lar, dispersed through the several climates of the world, that 
inasmuch as we had been informed by many of the enmity 
between Ethebed, king of the West-Saxons, and Richard 
the marquis, and were grieved sorely at this, on account of 
our spiritual children ; taking, therefore, wholesome counsel, 
we summoned one of our legates, Leo^ bishop of the holy 
church of Treves, and sent bun with our letters, admonish- 
ing them, that they should return from their ungodliness. 
He, passing vast spaces, at length crossed the sea, and, on 
the day of the Lord's nativity, came into the presence of the 
said king ; whom, having saluted on our part, he delivered 
to him the letters we had sent And all the faithful people 
of his kingdom, and senators of either order, being sum- 
moned, he granted, for love and fear of God Almighty, and 
of St. Peter, the chief of the apostles, and on account of our 
paternal admonition, the firmest peace for all his sons and 
daughters, present and future, and all his faithful people, 
without deceit On which account he sent Edelsin, prelate 
of the holy church of Sherborne, and Leofstan, son of Alf*

for his sons and daughters, present and future, and for tJl

After the death of this John, Gregory succeeded ; after 
whom came John XVI. ; then Silvester, also called Grerbert, 
about whom it will not be absurd, in my opinion, if I com- 
mit to writing those facts which are generally related about 
him.* Bom in Graul, from a lad he grew up a monk at 
Flory ; afterwards, when he arrived at the double path of 
Pythagoras,! either disgusted at a monastic life or seised by 
lust of glory, he fled by night into Spain, chiefly designii^ 
to learn astrology and other sciences of that description from 
the Saracens. Spain, formerly for many years possessed by 
the Romans, in the lime of the emperor Honoriua, feU under 
the power of the Goths. The Goths were Arians down to 
the days of St Gregory, when that people were united to 
the Catholic church by Leander bishop of Seville, and by 
king Recared, brother of Hermengildus,^ whom his father

whose body purchased, for its weight in gold, Aldefonsus 
king of Gidlicia in our times conveyed to Toledo. The Sa- 
raeens, who had subjugated the Goths, being conquered in 
their turn by Charles the Great, lost Grallicia and Lusitania, 
the krgest provinces of Spain ; but to this day they possess 
the southern parts. As the Christians esteem Toledo^ so do 
they hold Hispalis, which in common they call Seville, to be 
the capital of the kingdom ; there practising divinations and 
incantations, after the usual mode of that nation. Gerbert 
then, as I have related, coming among these people, satisfied 
his desires. There he surpassed Ptolemy with the astrolabe,f 
and AlcandrsBus in astronomy, and Julius Firmicus in judi- 
dal astrology ; there he learned what the singing and the 
flight of lurds portended ; there he acquired the art of call- 
ing up spirits from hell : in short, wlu^ver, hurtful or salu- 
tary, human curiosity has discovered. There is no necessity 
to speak of hb progress in the lawful sciences of arithmetic 
and astronomy, music and geometry, which he imbibed so 
thoroughly as to show they were beneath his talents, and 
which, with great perseverance, he revived in Gaul, where 
they had for a long time been wholly obsolete. Being cer-

tenced to death for his rebellion. The indexible constancy, with which he 
refbaed to accept the Arian communion, from which he had been con- 
Terted by Leander, as the price of his safety, procured for him the honour 
of being enrolled among the saints of the Ilomish church. — Haedt.

he gave rules which are scarcely understood even bj laborious 
computers. He resided with a certain philosopher of that 
sect, whose good will he had obtained, first by great liberal- 
ity, and then by promises. The Saracen had no objection to 
8^ his knowle^e; he frequently associated with him; 
would talk with him of matters at times serious, at others 
trivial, and lend him books to transcribe. There was how- 
ever one volume, containing the knowledge of his whole art, 
which he could never by any means entice him to lend. In 
consequence Grerbert was inflamed with anxious desire to 
obtain this book at any rate, '^ for we ever press more eagerly 
towards what is forbidden, and that which is denied is always 
esteemed most valuable."* Trying, therefore, the effect of 
entreaty, he besought him for the love of God, and by his 
friendship; offered him many things, and promised him 
more. When this failed he tried a nocturnal stratagem. 
He plied him with wine, and, with the help of his daughter, 
who connived at the attempt through the intimacy which 
Gerbert's attentions had procured, stole the book from under 
his pillow and fled. Waking suddenly, the Saracen pursued 
the fugitive by the direction of the stars, in which art he 
was well versed. The fugitive too, looking back, and disco- 
vering his danger by means of the same art, hid himself und^ 
a wooden bridge which was near at hand ; dmging to it, and 
hanging in such a manner as neither to touch earth nor 
water.| In this manner the eagerness of the pursuer being 
eluded, he returned home. Gerbert, then quickening his 
pace, arrived at the sea-coast. Here, by his incantations, he 
called up the devil, and made an agreement with him to be 
under his dominion for ever, if he would defend him irom 
the Saracen, who was again pursuing, and transport him to 
the opposite coast : this was accordingly done. 

Probably some may regard all this as a fiction, because 
the vulgar are used to undermine the fame of scholars, say- 
ing that the man who excels in any admirable science, holds 
converse with the devil. Of this, Boethius, in his book. On

the Consolation of Philosophy, complains ; and affirms, that 
be had the discredit of such practices on account of his 
ardent love of literature, as if he had polluted his knowledge 
hj detestable arts for the sake of ambition. '* It was hardly 
liely," says he, " that I, whom you dress up with such ex- 
cellence as almost to make me like God, should catch at the 
protection of the vilest spirits ; but it is in this point that 
we approach nearest to a connection with them, in that we 
are instructed in your learning, and educated in your cus- 
toms." So far Boethius. The singular choice of his death 
confirms me in the belief of his league with the devil ; else, 
when dying, as we shall relate hereafter, why should he, 
gladiator-like, maim his own person, unless conscious of some 
unusual crime ? Accordingly, in an old volume, which acci- 
dentally fell into my hands, wherein the names and years of 
all the popes are entered, I found written to the following 
purport, ** Silvester, who was also called Grerbert, ten months ; 
this man made a shameful end." 

Gerbert, returning into Gaul, became a public professor in 
the schools, and had as brother philosophers and companions 
of his studies, Constantine, abbat of the monastery of St. 
Maximin, near Orleans, .to whom he addressed the Rules of 
the Abacus ;* and Ethelbald bishop, as they say, of Winte- 
burg, who himself gave proof of ability, in a letter which 
he wrote to Grerbert, on a question concerning the diameter 
in Macrobius,! and in some other points. He had as pupils, 
of exquisite talents and noble origin, Robert, son of Hugh 
sumamed Capet ; and Otho, son of the emperor Otho. Ro- 
bert, a^rwards king of France, made a suitable return to 
his master, and appointed him archbishop of Rheims. In 
that cburch are still extant, as proofs of his science, a dock 
oonstracted on mechanical principles: and an hydraulic 
organ, in which the air escaping in a surprising manner, by 
the ^Drce of heated water, fills the cavity of the instrument, 
and the brazen pipes emit modulated tones through the mul- 
tifarious apertures. The king himself^ too, was weU skilled 
in sacred music, and in this and many other respects, a libe- 
ral benefactor to the church : moreover, he composed that 
beaatifol sequence, *' The grace of the Holy Spirit be with

US ;" and tJie response ^' He hath j<Hned together Judah and 
Jerusalem ;" together with more, which I should have plea- 
sure in relating^ were it not irksome to others to hear. Otho^ 
emperor of Italy after his father, made Grerhert archbishop 
of Bavenn^ and finally Roman pontiff. He followed up his 
fortune so suooessfuUy by the assistance of the devil, that he 
left nothing unexecuted which he had once conceived. The 
treasures formerly buried by the inhabitants! he disco* 
vered by the art of necromancy, and removing the rabbi^ 
applied to his own lusts. Thus viciously disposed are the 
wicked towards God, and thus they abuse his patience, 
though he had rather that they repent than perish. At last, 
he found where his master would stop, and as the proverb 
says, '^ in the same manner as one crow picks out another 
crow's eyes," while endeavouring to oppose his attempts with 
art like his own. 

There was a statue in the Campus Martius near Borne, I 
know not whether of brass or iron, having the forefinger <^11ie 
right hand extended, and on the head was written, " Strike 
here." The men of former times supposing this should be 
understood as if they might find a treasure there, had bat- 
tered the harmless statute by repeated strokes of a hatcdiet. 
But Gerbert convicted them of error by solving the problem 
in a very different manner. Marking where the shadow of 
the finger fell at noon-day, when the sun was on themeridiaB, 
he there placed a post ; and at night proceeded thither, attended 
only by a servant carrying a lanthom. The earth opening 
by means of his accustomed arts, displayed to them a spacious 
entrance. They see before them a vast palace with golden 
walls, golden roofs, every thing of gold ; golden soldiers 
amusing themselves, as it were, with golden dice ; a king of 
the same metal, at table with his queen ; delicaeies set before 
them, and servants waiting ; vessels of great weight and 
value, where the sculpture surpassed nature henel£ In the 
inmost part of the mansion, a carbuncle of the first quality, 
though small in appearance, dispell^ the darkness of night 
In the opposite corner stood a boy, holding a bow benl^ 
and the arrow drawn to the head. While the exquisKte 
art of every thing ravished the eyes of the spectaiton^ 
there was nothing which might be handled though it might 
be seen : for immediately, if any one stretched forth his hand

to toach any thing, all these figures appeared to rush forwai'd 
and repel such presumption. Alarmed at this, Gerbert re- 
pressed his inclination : but not so the servant. He en- 
deavoured to snatch off from a table, a knife of admirable 
workmanship ; supposing that in a bootj of such magnitude, 
so small a theft could hardly be discovered. In an instant, 
the figures all starting up with loud clamour, the boy let fly 
his arrow at the carbuncle, and in a moment all was in dark- 
ness ; and if the servant had not, by the advice of his master, 
made the utmost despatch in throwing back the knife, they 
would have both suffered severely. In this manner, their 
boundless avarice unsatiated, they departed, the lantern 
directing thdr steps. That he performed such things by un- 
lavrful devices is the generally received opinion. Yet, how- 
ever, if any one diligently investigate the truth, he will see 
that even Solomon, to whom God himself had given wisdom, 
was not ignorant of these arts : for, as Josephus relates,* he, 
in conjunction with his father, buried vast treasures in coffers, 
which were hidden, as he says, in a kind of necromantic 
manner, under ground: neither was Hyrcanus, celebrated 
for his skill in prophecy and his valour ; who, to ward ofi 
the distress of a siege, dug up, by the same art, three thousand 
talents of gold from the sepulchre of David, and gave part 
of them to the besiegers ; with the remainder building an 
hospital for the reception of strangers. But Herod, who 
would make an attempt of the same kind, with more pre- 
sumption than knowledge, lost in consequence many of his 
attendants, by an eruption of internal fire. Besides, when 
I hear the Lord Jesus saying, " My father worketh hitherto, 
and I work ;" I believe, that He, who gave to Solomon power 
over demons to such a degree, as the same historian declares, 
that he relates there were men, even in his time, who could 
eject them from persons possessed, by applying to the nostrils 
(^ the patient a ring having the impression pointed out by 
Solomon : I believe, I say, that he could give, also, the same 
science to this man : but I do not affirm that he did give it. 

Bat leaving these matters to my readers, I shall relate 
what I recollect having heard, when I was a boy, from a cer- 
tain monk of our house, a native of Aquitaine, a liian in

jeors, and a physician by profession. " When I was seven 
years old," said he, ** despising the mean circumstances of my 
father, a poor citizen of Barcelona, I surmounted the snowy 
Alps, and went into Italy. There, as was to be expected in a 
boy of that age, having to seek my daily bread in great distress, 
I paid more attention to the food of my mind than of my 
body. As I grew up I eagerly viewed many of the wonders 
of that country and impressed them on my memory. Among 
others I saw a perforated mountain, beyond which the in- 
habitants supposed the treasures of Octavian were hidden. 
Many persons were reported to have entered into these 
caverns for the purpose of exploring them, and to have there 
perished, being bewildered by the intricacy of the ways. Bat^ 
as hardly any apprehension can restrain avaricious minds 
from their intent, I, with my companions, about twelve in 
number, meditated an expedition of this nature, either for 
the sake of plunder, or through curiosity. Imitating there- 
fore the ingenuity of Daedalus, who brought Theseus out of 
the labyrinth by a conducting clue, we, also carrying a large 
ball of thread, fixed a small post at the entrance. Tying the 
end of the thread to it, and lighting lanterns, lest dark- 
ness, as well as intricacy, should obstruct us, we unrolled the 
clue ; and fixing a post at every mile, we proceeded on our 
journey along the caverns of the mountain, in the best 
manner we were able. Every thing was dark, and full of 
horrors ; the bats, flitting from holes, assailed our eyes and 
faces : the path was narrow, and made dreadful on the left- 
hand by a precipice, with a river flowing beneath it. We 
saw the way strewed with bare bones : we wept over the 
carcasses of men yet in a state of putrefaction, who^ induced 
by hopes similar to our own, had in vain attempted, after 
their entrance, to return. After some time, however, and 
many alarms, arriving at the farther outlet^ we beheld a lake 
of softly murmuring waters, where the wave came gently 
rolling to the shores. A bridge of brass united the opposite 
banks. Beyond the bridge were seen golden horses of great 
size, mounted by golden riders, and all those other things 
which are related of Grerbert. The mid-day beams of 
Phoebus darting upon them, with redoubled splendour, daz- 
zled the eyes of the beholders. Seeing these things at a dis- 
tance, we should have been delighted with a nearer view. 



A^. 100S.J THB AQUITANIAN MONK. 179 

meaning, if fate would pennit, to carry off some portion of 
the precious metaL Animating each other in turn, we pre- 
pared to pass over the lake. All our efforts, however, were 
▼ain : for as soon as one of the company, more forward than 
the rest, had put his foot on the hither edge of the bridge, 
immediately, wonderful to hear, it became depressed, and the 
farther edge was elevated, bringing forward a rustic of brass 
with a brazen club, with whidi, dashing the waters, he so 
clouded the air, as completely to obscure both the day and 
the heavens. The moment the foot was withdrawn, peace 
was restored. The same was tried by many of us, with 
exactly the same result. Despairing, then, of getting over, 
we stood there some little time ; and, as long as we could, at 
least glutted our eyes with the gold. Soon after returning 
by the guidance of the thread, we found a silver dish, which 
being cut in pieces and distributed in morsels only irritated 
the thirst of our avidity without allaying it. Consulting 
together the next day, we went to a professor, of that time, 
who was said to know the unutterable name of God. When 
questioned, he did not deny his knowledge, adding, that, so 
great was the power of that name, that no magic, no witch- 
craft could resist it. Hiring him at a great price, fasting 
And confessed, he led us, prepared in the same manner, to a 
fountain. Taking up some water from it in a silver vessel, 
he silently traced the letters with his fingers, until we under- 
stood by our eyes, what was unutterable with our tongues. 
We then went confidently to the mountain, but we found the 
farther outlet beset, as I believe, with devils, hating, forsooth, 
the name of God because it was able to destroy their inven- 
tions. In the morning a Jew-necromancer came to me, ex- 
cited by the report of our attempt ; and, having inquired 
into the matter, when he heard of our want of enterprise, 
^ Tou shall see," said he, venting his spleen with loud laugh- 
ter, "how far the power of my art can prevail." Ajid 
immediately entering the mountain, he soon after came out 
Again, bringing, as a proof of his having passed the lake, 
many things which I had noted beyond it : indeed some of that 
most precious dust, which turned every thing that it touched 
into gold : not that it was really so, but only retained this 
appearance imtil washed with water ; for nothing effected 
by necromancy can, when put into water, deceive the sight

of the beholders. The truth of my assertion is confirmed 
by a circamstance which happened about the same time. 

'' There were in a public street leading to Rome, iwo old 
women, the most drunken and filthy beings that can be con- 
ceived ; both liying in the same hut, and both practising 
witchcraft. If any lone stranger happened to come in thear 
way, they used to make him appear either a horse, or a sow, 
or some other animal ; expose him for sale to dealers, and 
gluttonize with the money. By chance, on a certain night, 
taking in a lad to lodge who got his livelihood by stage- 
dancing, they turned him into an ass : and so possessed a 
creature extremely advantageous to their interests, who 
caught the eyes of such as passed by the strangeness of his 
postures. In whatever mode the old woman commanded, 
the ass began to dance, for he retained his understandii^, 
though he had lost the power of speech. In this manner 
the women had accumulated much money ; for there was, 
daily, a large concourse of people, from all parts, to see the 
tricks of the ass. The report of this induced a rich neigh- 
bour to purchase the quadruped for a considerable sum ; and 
he was warned, that, if he would have him as a constant 
dancer, he must keep him from water. The person who had 
charge of him rigidly fulfilled his orders. A long time 
elapsed ; the ass sometimes gratified his master by his reeling 
motions, and sometimes entertained his friends with his tricks. 
But, however, as in time all things surfeit, he began at length 
to be less cautiously observed. In consequence of this 
negligence, breaking his halter, he got loose, plunged Into a 
pool hard by, and rolling for a long time in the water, re- 
covered his human form. The keeper, inquiring of all he 
met, and pursuing him by the track of his feet, asked him if 
he had seen an ass ; he replied that himself had been an ass, 
but was now a man : and related the whole transaction. The 
servant astonished told it to his master, and the master to 
pope Leo, the holiest man in our times. The old women 
were convicted, and confessed the fact The pope doubting 
this, was assured by Peter Damian, a learned man, that it 
was not wonderful that such things should be done : he pro- 
duced the example of Simon Magus,* who caused Fanstini-

anus to assume the figure of Simon, and to become an ol^ect 
of terror to his sons^ and thus rendered his holiness better 
skilled in such matters for the future." 

I have inserted this narrative of the Aquitanian to the in- 
tent that what is reported of Grerbert should not seem 
wonderful to any person ; which is, that he cast, for his own 
purposes, the head of a statue, by a certain inspection of the 
stars when all the planets were about to begin their courses, 
which spake not unless spoken to, but then pronounced the 
truth, either in the affirmative or negative. For instance, 
when Grerbert would saj, '' Shall I be pope ?" the statute 
would reply, "Yes." "Am I to die, ere I sing mass at 
Jerusalem T " Na" They relate, that he was so much 
deodved by this ambiguity, that he thought nothing of 
repentance : for when would he think of going to Jerusalem, 
to accelerate his own death ? Nor did he foresee that at Rome 
there is a church called Jerusalem, that is, " the vision of 
peace," because whoever flies thither finds safety, whatsoever 
crime he may be guilty of. We have heard, that this was 
called an asylum in the very infancy of the city, because 
Bomulus, to increase the number of his subjects, had ap- 
pointed it to be a refuge for the guilty of every description. 
The pope sings mass there on three Sundays, which are 
called " The station at Jerusalem." Wherefore upon one of 
those days Gerbert, preparing himself for mass, was suddenly 
struck with sickness ; which increased so that he took to his 
bed : and consulting his statue, he became convinced of his 
delusion and of his approaching death. Calling, therefore^ 
the cardinab together, he lamented his crimes for a long 
space of time. They, being struck with sudden fear were 
unable to make any reply, whereupon he began to rave, and 
losing his reason through excess of pain, commanded him- 
self to be maimed, and cast forth piecemeal, saying, " Let 
him have the service of my limbs, who before sought their 
homage ; for my mind never consented to that abominable 
oath." 

And since I have wandered from my subject, I think it 
may not be unpleasant to relate what took place in Saxony 

eowilenanoe, by rubbing hk face with s medicated unguent, to the great 
alarm of hia sons, who miitook him for Simon, and fled until recalled bj

182 WILIXIAM OF MALHESBUKT. Ib. a. c la 

in the time of this king, in the year of our Lord 1012, and 
is not so generally known. It is better to dilate on such 
matters than to dwell on Ethelred's indolence and calamities : 
and it will be more pleasing certainly, and nearer the truth, 
if I subjoin it in the original language of the person who was 
a sufferer, than if I had clothed it in my own words. Besides^ 
I think it ornamental to a work, that the style sh6nld be 
occasionally varied. 

" I Ethdbert,* a sinner, even were I desirous of concealing 
the divine judgment which overtook me, yet the tremor of 
my limbs would betray me ; wherefore I shall relate circum- 
stantially how this happened, that all may know the heavy 
punishment due to disobedience. We were, on the eve of 
our Lord^s nativity, in a certain town of Saxony, in which 
was the church of Magnus the martyr, and a {Hriest named 
Robert had begun the first mass. I was in the diurchyard 
with eighteen companions, fifteen men and three women, 
dancing, and singing profane songs to such a d^ree that I 
interrupted the priest, and our voices resounded amid the 
sacred solemnity of the mass. Wherefore, having commanded 
us to be silent, an^ not being attended to, he curbed us in the 
following words, * May it please Gk)d and St. Magnus, that 
you may remain singing in that manner for a whole year.' 
His words had their effect. The son of John the priest 
seized his sister who was singing with us, by the arm, and 
immediately tore it from her body ; but not a drop of blood 
flowed out She also remained a whole year with us, dancing 
and singing. The rain fell not upon us ; nor did cold, nor 
heat, nor hunger, nor thirst>, nor fatigue assail us : we neither 
wore our clothes nor shoes, but we kept on singing as though 
we had been insane. First we sank into the ground up to 
our knees : next to our thighs ; a covering was at length, by 
the permissioa of Grod, built over us to keep off the rain. 
When a year had elapsed, Herbert, bishop of the city of 
Cologne, released us from the tie wherewith our hands were 
bound, and reconciled us before the altar of St Magnus. 
The daughter of the priest, with the other two women, died 
immediately ; the rest of us slept three whole days and 
nights : some died afterwards, and are famed for miracles : 
the remainder betray their punishment by the trembling of

their limbs. This narrative was given to us bj the lord 
Peregrine, the successor of Herbert, in the year of our Lord 
1013." 

In that city, which formerly was called Agrippina, from 
Agrippa the son-in-law of Augustus, but afterwards named 
Colonia by the emperor Tnyan, because being there created 
emperor he founded in it a colony of Roman citizens ; in this 
city, I repeat, there was a certain bishop, famed for piety, 
though to a degree hideous in his person ; of whom I shall re- 
late one miracle, which he predicted when dying, after having 
first recorded what a singular chance elevated him to such an 
eminent station. The emperor of that country going to 
hunt on Quinquagesima Sunday, came alone, for his com- 
oompanions were dispersed, to the edge of a wood, where 
this rural priest, deformed and almost a monster, had a 
church. Tlie emperor, feigning himself a soldier, humbly 
begs a mass, which the priest immediately begins. The 
other in the meantime was revolving in his mind why God, 
from whom all beautiful things proceed, should suffer so de- 
formed a man to administer his sacraments. Presently, 
when that verse in the tract occurred, " Know ye that the 
Lord himself is God," the priest looked behind him, to chide 
the inattention of an assistant, and said with a louder voice, 
as if in reply to the emperor's thoughts, " He made us ; and 
not we ourselves." Struck with this expression, the emperor 
esteeming him a prophet, exalted him, though unwilling and 
reluctant, to the archbishopric of Cologne, which, when he 
had once assumed, he dignified by his exemplary conduct ; 
kindly oicouraging those who did well, and branding with 
the stigma of excommunication such as did otherwise, with- 
out respect of persons. The inhabitants of that place pro- 
claim a multitude of his impartial acts; one of which the 
reader will peruse in that abbreviated form which my work 
requires. In a monastery of nuns in that city, there was a 
oertaiii virgin who had there grown up, more by the kind- 
ness of her parents than through any innate wish for a holy 
life : this girl, by the attraction of her beauty and her afiable 
language to all, allured many lovers; but while others, 
Uurough fear of God or the censure of the world, restrained 
their desires, there was one who^ excited to wantonness by 
the extent of his wealth and the nobility of his descent,

broke through the bounds of law and of justice, and de- 
spoiled her of her virginitj ; and oanying her off kept her 
as his lawful wife. Much time elapsed while the abbess en- 
treated, and his friends admonished him not to persevere in 
so dreadful a crime. Turning a deaf ear, howerer, to his 
advisers, he continued as immoveable as a rock. By chance 
at this time the prelate was absent, occupied in business at 
Rome; but on his return the circumstance was related to 
him. He commands the sheep to be returned to the feid 
directly ; and after much altercation the woman was restored 
to the monastery. Not long after, watching an oj^wrtunity 
when the bishop was absent, she was again carried away. 
Excommunication was then denounced against tiie deUnqneat^ 
so that no person could speak to^ or associate with him. 
This, however, he held in contempt, and retired to one of his 
estates afar off, not to put the command in force, but to dude 
its power : and there, a turbulent and powerful man, he lived 
in company with his excommunicated paramour. But when it 
pleased God to take the bishop to himself, and he was lying 
in extreme bodily pain upon Ms bed, the neighbours flowed 
around him that they might partake the final benedictioii of 
this holy man. The offender alone not daring to i^pear, 
prevailed on some persons to speak for him. The moment 
the bishop heard his name he groaned, and then, I add his 
very words, spoke to the following effect, " If that wretched 
man shall desert that accursed woman, he shall be absolved ; 
but if he persist, let him be ready to give account before 
God, the following year, at the very day and hour on which 
I shall depart : moreover, you will see me expire when the 
bell shall proclaim the sixth hour." Nor were his words 
vain ; for he departed at the time which he had predicted ; 
and the other, together with his mistress, at the expiration 
of the year, on the same day, and at the same hour^ was 
killed by a stroke of lightning. 

But king Ethelred, after the martyrdom of Elphege, as we 
have related, gave his see to a bishop named Living.* More- 
over, Turkill, the Dane, who had been the chief cause of the 
archbishop's murder, had settled in England, and held the 
East Angles in subjection. For the other Danes, exacting

firam the English a tribute of eight thousand pounds, had 
distributed themselvesy as best suited their convenience, in 
the towns, or in the country ; and fifteen of their ships, with 
the crews, had entered into the king's service. In the 
meantime Thurkill sent messengers to Swejm, king of Den- 
mark, inviting him to come to England ; teUing him that the 
land was rich and fertile, but the king a driveUer ; and that, 
whoUj given up to wine and women, his last thoughts were 
those of war : that in consequence he was hateful to his own 
people and contemptible to foreigners : that the commanders 
were jealous of each other, the people weak, and that they 
would fly the field, the moment the onset was sounded. 

Sweyn* was naturally cruel, nor did he require much 
persuasion ; preparing his ships, therefore, he hastened his 
voyage. Sandwich was the port he made, principally de- 
signing to avenge his sister Gunhilda. This woman, who 
possessed considerable beauty, had come over to England 
with her husband Palling, a powerful nobleman, and by em- 
bracing Christianity, had made herself a pledge of the Dan- 
ish peace. In his ill-fated fury, Edric had commanded her, 
though proclaiming that the shedding her blood would bring 
mat evil on the whole kingdom, to be beheaded with the other 
Danes. She bore her death with fortitude ; and she neither 
tamed pale at the moment, nor, when dead, and her blood ex- 
hausted, did she lose her beauty ; her husband was murdered 
before her face, and her son, a youth of amiable disposition, 
was transfixed with four spears. Sweyn then proceeding 
through East Anglia against the Northumbrians, received their 
submission without resistance : not indeed, that the native 
ardour of their minds, which brooked no master, had grown 
oool, but because Utred, their prince, was the first to give ex- 
ample of desertion. On their submission all the other people 
who inhabit England on the north, gave him tribute and hos- 
tages. Coming southward, he compelled those of Oxford and 
Winchester, to obey his conmiands ; the Londoners alone, pro- 
tecting their lawful sovereign within their walls, shut their

murder of the Uanes took place on St. Brice's day, i..d. 1002, and accoid- 
iqgly we find Sweyn infesting England in 1 003 and the following year 
(flee Saxon Chronicle) : but this his second arriya^ took place, a.d. 1013 :

object of his prasent attack.

gates against bim. The Danes, on the other hand, assailing 
with greater ferocity, nurtured their fortitude with the hope 
of j&me; the townsmen were ready to rush on death for 
freedom, thinking they ought never to be forgiven, should 
they desert their king, who had committed his life to their 
chfljge. While the conflict was raging fiercely on either 
side, victory befriended the juster cause; for the citizens 
made wonderful exertions, every one esteeming it glorious to 
show his unwearied alacrity to his prince, or even to die for 
him. Part of the enemy were destroyed, and part drowned 
in the river Thames, because in their headlong fury, they 
had not sought a bridge. With his shattered army Sweyn 
retreated to Bath, Where Ethelmer, governor of the western 
district, with his followers, submitted to him. And, although 
all England was already bending to his dominion, yet not 
even now would the Londoners have yielded, had not Ethel- 
red withdrawn his presence from among them. For being a 
man given up to indolence, and, through consciousness of hia 
own misdeeds, supposing none could be faithful to him, and 
at the same time wishing to escape the difficulties of a battle 
and a siege, he by his departure left them to their own exer- 
tions. However, they applied the best remedy they could to 
their exigencies, and surrendered after the example of their 
countrymen. They were men laudable in the extreme, and 
such as Mars himself would not have disdained to encounter, 
had they possessed a competent leader. Even while they 
were supported by the mere shadow of one, they risked 
every chance of battle, nay even a siege of several months' 
continuance. He in the meantime giving fresh instance 
of his constitutional indolence, fled from the city, and by 
secret journeys came to Southampton, whence he passed over 
to the Isle of Wight. Here he addressed those abbats and 
bishops who, even in such difficulties, could not bring them- 
selves to desert their master, to the following effect: ''That 
they must perceive in what dreadful state his affairs, and 
those of his family were ; that he was banished from his pa- 
ternal throne by the treachery of his generals, and that he, 
in whose hands their safety was formerly vested, now re- 
quired the assistance of others ; that though lately a monarch 
and a potentate, he was now an outcast and a fugitive ; a 
melancholy change for him, because it certainly is more toler-

Me never to have had power, than to have lost it when 
poesessed ; and more especially disgraceful to the English, as 
this instance of deserting their prince would he noised 
thronghout the world; that through mere regard to him 
thej had exposed their houses and property to plunderers, 
and, unprovided, taken to a voluntary flight ; food was mat- 
ter of difficulty to all; many had not even clothing; he 
commended their fidelity indeed, but still could find no secu- 
rity from it ; the country was now so completely subdued, 
the coast so narrowly watched, that there was no escape un- 
attended with danger : that they should, therefore, confer to- 
gether, what was to be done : were they to remain, greater 
peril was to be apprehended from their countrymen, than 
£rom their enemies, for perhaps they might purchase the 
&Y0xir of their new master by joining to distress them ; and 
certainly to be killed by an enemy was to be ascribed to fortune, 
to be betrayed by a fellow citizen was to be attributed to want of 
exertion ; were they to fly to distant nations, it would be with the 
loss of honour ; if to those who knew them, the dread would 
be, lest their dispositions should take a tinge from their reverse 
of fortune; for many great and illustrious men had been 
killed on similar occasions ; but, however, he must make the 
ecq>eriment, and sound the incHnations of Bichard, duke of 
Normandy, who, if he should kindly receive his sister and 
nephews, might probably not unwillingly afford him his pro- 
tection. His favour shown to my wife and children," con- 
tiniied he, ** will be the pledge of my own security. Should 
he oppose me, I am confident, nay fully confident, I shall not 
want spirit to die here with honour, in preference to living 
there with ignominy. Wherefore this very month of Au- 
gust, while milder gales are soothing the ocean, let Emma 
make a voyage to her brother, and take our children, our 
common pledges, to be deposited with him. Let their 
companions be the bishop of Durham and the abbat of 
Peterborough; I myself will remain here till Christmas, 
and should he send Imck a favourable answer, I will follow 
directly.'' 

On the breaking up of the conference, all obeyed ; they set 
BaQ for Normandy, while he remained anxiously expecting a 
favourable report. Shortly after he learned ftom abroad, 
that Riohard had received his sister with great affection, and 



188 WILLIAIC OF HALMB8BURT. [a. ri. c. 10. 



that he invited the king also to condescend to become 
inmate. Ethelred, therefore, going into Normandy, in tha 
month of January, felt his distresses soothed by the atten- 
tions of his host. This Bichard was ^son of Richard the 
first, and equalled his father in good fortune and good qua* 
lities; though he certainly surpassed him in heavenly con- 
cerns. He completed the monastery at Feschamp, which his 
father had begun. He was more intent on prayer and tem« 
perance, than you would require in any monk, or hermit*. 
He was humble to excess, in order that he might subdue by 
his patience, the petulance of those who attacked him. 
Moreover it is reported, that at night, secretly escaping the 
observation of his servants, he was accustomed to go unat> 
tended to the matins* of the monks, and to continue in prayer 
till day-light Intent on this practice, one night in par- 
ticular, at Feschamp, he was earlier than customary, and 
finding the door shut, he forced it open with unusual vio- 
lence, and disturbed the sleep of the sacristan. He, astxH 
nished at the noise of a person knocking in the dead of 
night, got up, that he might see the author of so bold a 
deed ; and finding only a countryman in appearance, clotiied 
in rustic garb, he could not refrain from laving hands on 
him ; and, moved with vehement indignation, he caught hold 
of his hair, and gave this illustrious man a number of severe 
blows, which he bore with incredible patience, and without 
uttering a syllable. The next day, Richard laid his 
plaint before the chapter, f and with counterfeited 
summoned the monk to meet him at the town of Argens^ 
threatening that, " he would take such vengeance for tiie 
injury, so that all Finance should talk of it." On the day 
appointed, while the monk stood by, almost dead with 4ear, 
he detailed the matter to the nobUity, largely exaggerating 
the enormity of the transaction, and keeping the culprit in 
suspense, by crafty objections to what h^ urged in mitiga- 
tion. Finally, after he had been mercifully judged by the 
nobility, he pardoned him ; and to make his forgiveness more 
acceptable, he annexed aU that town, with its appurtenances, 
reported to be abundant in the best wine, to the office of this 
sacristan: saying, ^< That he was an admirable monk, who 

• Matins were sometimes performed shortlj after midnight 
t It was customary to hold a chapter immediately after primei.

properly observed his appointed charge, and did not break 
silence, though roused with angej*." In the twenty-eighth 
jear of his dukedom, he died, having ordered his body to be 
buried at the door of the church, where it would be sub- 
jected to the feet of such as passed by, and to the spouts of 
water which streamed from above. In our time, however, 
William, third abbat of that pLice, regarding this as dis- 
graceful, removed the long-continued reproach, and taking 
up the body, placed it before the high altar. He had a 
brother, Robert, whom he made archbishop of Rouen, though 
by this he tarnished his reputation. For he, cruelly abusing 
this honour, at first, committed many crimes and many atro- 
cioiis acts; but growing in years, he certainly wiped off 
some of them by his very liberal almsgiving. After Richard, 
his son of the same name obtained the principality, but lived 
scarcely a year. A vague opinion indeed has prevailed, 
that, by the connivance of his brother Robert, whom Richard 
the second begat on Judith, daughter of Conan, earl of 
Brittany, a certain woman, skilled in poisons, took the 
young man off. In atonement for his privity to this trans- 
action he departed for Jerusalem, after the seventh year of 
his earldom; venturing on an undertaking very meritorious 
at that time, by commencing, with few followers, a journey, 
exposed to incursions of barbarians, and strange, by reason 
of the customs of the Saracens. He persevered neverthe- 
less, and did not stop, but safely completed the whole dis- 
tance^ and purchasing admission at a high price, with bare 
feet, and full of tears, he worshipped at that glory of the 
Christians, the sepulchre of our Lord. Conciliating the 
favour of God, as we believe, by this labour, on his return 
homewards he ended his days at Nice, a city of Bithynia ; 
cot oSy as it is said, by poison. This was administer^ by 
his servant Ralph, sumamed Mowin, who had wrought him- 
self up to the commission of this crime, from a hope of 
obtaining the dukedom. But on his return to Normandy, 
the matter becoming known to all, he was detested as a 
monster, and retired to perpetual exile. To Robert suc- 
ceeded William, his son, then a child, of whom as I shall 
have to speak hereafter, I shall now return to my narrative. 

In the meantime Swejn, as I have before related* op- 
pressed England with rapine and with slaughter: the in- 



190 WILLIAK OF ICALKESBUBT. [i.u.clO. 

habitants were first plundered of their property, and then 
proscribed. In every citj it was matter of doubt what 
should be done : if revolt was determined on, they had none 
to take the lead; if submission was made choice of^ they 
would have a harsh ruler to deal with. Thus their public 
and private property, together with their hostages, was car- 
ried to the fleet ; as he was not a lawful sovereign, but a 
most cruel tyrant. The Deity, however, was too kind to 
permit England to fluctuate long in such keen distress, for 
the invader died shortly afler, on the purification of St. 
Mary,* though it is uncertain by what death. It is reported, 
that while devastating the possessions of St. Edmund, f 
king and martyr, he appeared to him in a vision, and gently 
addressed him on the misery of his people ; that on Sweyn's 
replying insolently, he struck him on the head ; and that, in 
consequence of the blow, he died, as has been said, imme- 
diately after. The Danes then elected Canute, the son of 
Sweyn, king ; while the Angles, declaring that their natural 
sovereign was dearer to them, if he could conduct himself 
more royally than he had hitherto done, sent for king Ethel- 
red out of Normandy. He despatched Edward, his son, first, 
to sound the fidelity of the higher orders and the inclinatioii 
of the people, on the spot ; who, when he saw the wishes of 
all tending in his favour, went back in full confidence for his 
father. The king returned, and, being flattered by the joy- 
ful plaudits of the Angles, that he might appear to have 
shaken off his constitutional indolence, he hastened to collect 
an army against Canute, who was at that time in Lindsey, 
where his father had left him with the ships and hostages, 
and was levying fresh troops and horses, that, mustering a 
sufficient force, he might make a vigorous attack upon his 
enemies unprepared: vowing most severe vengeance, as he 
used to say, on the deserters. But, circumvented by a con- 
trivance similar to his own, he retreated. Escaping at that 
time with much difficulty, and putting to sea with his re- 
maining forces, he coasted the British ocean from east to 
south, and landed at Sandwich. Here, setting aU divine and 
human laws at defiance, he mutilated Ids hostages, who were 
young men of great nobility and el^ance, by depriving them

The year following a grand council of Danes J^ii^ ^ ^ 
was assembled at Oxford, where the king comm^ cnthout 
of the noblest Danes, Sigeferth, and Morcar, ^^nrino 
treachery to him by the impeachment of the traitor KcLyy^^* 
be put to death. He had lured them, by his soothu«^ 
expressions, into a chamber, and deprived them, when drunk 
to excess, of their lives, by bis attendants who had been 
prepared for that purpose. The cause of their murder was 
said to be, his unjustifiable desire for their property. Their 
dependants, attempting to revenge the death of their lords by 
arms, were worsted, and driven into the tower of St. 
Frideswide's church at Oxford, where, as they could not be 
dislodged, they were consumed by fire : however, shortly 
after, the foul stain was wiped out by the king's penitence, 
and the sacred place repaired. I have read the history of 
this transaction, which is deposited in the archives of that 
church. The wife of Sigeferth, a woman remarkable for her 
rank and beauty, was carried prisoner to Malmesbury ; on 
which account, Edmund, the king's son, dissembling his 
intention, took a journey into those parts. Seeing her, he 
became enamoured ; and becoming enamoured, he made her 
his wife ; cautiously keeping their union secret from his 
father, who was as much an object of contempt to his family 
as to strangers. This Edmund was not born of Emma, but 
of some other person, whom fame has left in obscurity. 
With that exception, he was a young man in every respect 
of noble disposition ; of great strength both of mind and 
person, and, on this account, by the English, called 
*^ Ironside : " he would have shrouded the indolence of his 
father, and the meanness of his mother, by his own con- 
spicuous virtue, could the fates have spared him. Soon after, 
at the instigation of his wife, he asked of his father the

^^jSrod indeed attempted to oppose him, but being thwarted 
JSf^driCy he placed his forees in a secure situation. Edric, 
however, thinking it unnecessary longer to dissemble, bat 
that he might, now, openly throw off the mask, revolted to 
Canute with forty ships, and all West Saxony following hia 
example, delivered hostages, and gave up their arms. Yet 
the Mercians repeatedly assembling stood forward to resist : 
and if the king would but come, and command whither they 
were to march, and bring with him the leading men of 
London, they were ready to shed their blood for their 
country. But he, accustomed to commit his safety to 
fortifications, and not to attack the enemy, remained in 
London ; never venturing out, for fear, as he sud, of 
traitors. On the contrary, Canute was gaining towns and 
villages over to his party ; and was never unemployed ; for 
he held consultations by night, and fought battles by day. 
Edmund, after long deliberation, esteeming it best^ in such 
an emergency, to recover, if possible, the revolted cities by 
arms, brought over Utred, an earl, on the other side of the 
Humber, to the same sentiments. They imagined too, that 
such cities as were yet doubtful which side to take, would 
determine at once, if they would only infiict signal vengeanoe 
on those which had revolted. But Canute, possessed of equal 
penetration, circumvented them by a sinuliar contrivance. 
Giving over the West Saxons and that part of Mercia which 
he had subjugated, to the custody of his generals, he 
proceeded himself against the Northumbrians ; and, by 
depopulating the country, compelled Utred to retire, to 
defend his own possessions ; and notwithstanding he sur- 
rendered himself, yet with inhuman levity he ordered him to

Gillingham, about Rogation-day. After the festival of St. 
John, engaging them again at Sceorstan,:( he retired from a 
drawn-battle. The English had begun to give way, at the 
instance of Edric ; who being on the adversaries' side, and 
holding in his hand a sword stained with the blood of a 
fellow whom he had dexterously slain, exclaimed, '^Fly, 
wretches ! fly ! behold, your king was slain by this sword !" 
The Angles would have fled immediately, had not the king, 
apprised of this circumstance, proceeded to an eminence, and 
taking off his helmet, shown his face to his comrades. Then 
brandishing a dart with all his forces, he launched it at Edric ; 
but being seen, and avoided, it missed him, and struck a 
soldier standing near ; and so great was its violence, that it 
even transfixed a second. Night put a stop to the battle, the 
hostile armies retreating as if by mutual consent, though the 
English had well-nigh obtained the victory. 

After this the sentiments of the West Saxons changed, 
and they acknowledged their lawful sovereign. Edmund 
proceeded to London, that he might liberate those deserving 
dtizens whom a party of the enemy had blocked up imme- 
diately after his departure ; moreover they had surrounded 
the whole city, on the parts not washed by the river Thames, 
with a trench ; and many men lost their lives on both sides 
in the skirmishes. Hearing of the king's approach, they

king in person ; who suddenly seizing the ford, which I have 

before mentioned at Brentford, * dispersed them with signal 

loss. 

While Edmund was preparing to pursue, and utteriy de- 
stroy the last remains of these plunderers, he was prevented 
by the crafty and abandoned Edric, who had again insinu- 
ated himself into his good graces ; for he had come over to 
Edmund, at the instigation of Canute, that he might betray 
his designs. Had the king only persevered, this would have 
been the last day for the Danes ; but misled by the insinua- 
tions of a traitor, who affirmed that the enemy would make 
no farther attempt, he brought swift destruction upon him- 
self^ and the whole of England. Being thus allowed to 
escape, they again assembled ; attacked the East Angles, 
and, at Assandun,f compelled the king himself, who came 
to their assistance, to retreat Here again, the person I am 
ashamed to mention so frequently, designedly gave the first 
example of flight. A small number, who, mindful of their 
former fame, and encoura^g each other, had formed a com- 
pact body, were cut off to a man. On this field of battle 
Canute gained the kingdom ; the glory of the Angles fell ; 
and the whole flower of the country withered. Amongst 
these was Ulfkytel, earl of East Anglia, who had gained 
immortal honour in the time of Sweyn, when first attacking 
the pirates, he showed that they might be overcome: here

Edmiuid flying henoe ahooBt alone, came to Gloacester, in 
«fder that he might, there re-assemble his forces, and attack 
the enemy, indolent, as he supposed, from their recent vie- 
tory. Nor was Canute wantipg in courage to pursue the 
fti^ve. When everytiiing was ready for battle, Edmund 
demanded a single combat ; that two individuals might not, 
for the lust of dominion, be stained with the blood of so 
mai^ subjects, when they might try their fortune without 
the destructioa of their faithful adherents: and observing, 
that it most redound greatly to the credit of either to have 
obtained so vast a dominion at his own personal peril But 
Canute refused this proposition altogetiier; affirming thai 
his courage was surpassing, but that he was apprehensive 
of trastisg his diminutive person against so bulky an an- 
tagonist: wherefi}re, as botii had equal pretoisions to the 
kingdom, since the father of either of them had possessed 
it, it was consistent with prudence that they should lay 
aside their animosity, and divide England.* This propo- 
sition was adopted by either army, and confirmed with much 
applause, both for its equity and its beneficent regard to the 
repose of the people who were worn out with continual suf- 
fering. In' consequence, Edmund, overcome by the general 
damoiir, made peace, and entered into treaty with Canute, 
retaining West Saxony himself and giving Mercia to the 
other. He died soon after on the festival of St. Andrew,! 
though by what mischance is not known, and was buried at 
Glastonbury near his grandfather Edgar. Fame asperses 
Edric, as having, through regard for Canute, compassed his 
death by means of his servants : reporting that there were 
two attendants on the king to whom he had committed the 
entire care of his person, and, that E^dric seducing them by 
promises, at length made them his accomplices, though at 
first they were struck with horror at the enormity of the 
crime ; and that, at his suggestion, they drove an iron hook

purpose. Edwin, his brother on the mother^s side, a jaath 
of amiable disposition, was driven from England by Edric, 
at the command of Canute, and suffering extremdj for a 
considerable time, ^^both hj sea and land," his body, as is 
often the case, became affected bj the anxiety of his mind^ 
and he died in Enghmd, where he lay concealed after a 
clandestine return, and Hear buried at Tavistock. IBia sons, 
Edwy and Edward, were sent to the king of Sweden to be 
put to death ; but being preserved by his mercy, they went 
to the king of Hungary, where, after being kindly treated 
for a time, the elder died ; and the younger married Agatha, 
the sister of the queen. His brothers by Emma, Alfred and 
Edward, lay securely concealed in Normandy for the whole 
time that Canute lived. 

I find that their uncle Richard took no steps to restore 
them to their country : on the contrary, he married his sister 
Emma to the enemy and invader ; and it may be difficult to 
say, whether to the greater ignominy of him who bestowed 
her, or of the woman who consented to share the nuptial 
couch of that man who had so cruelly molested her husband, 
and had driven her children into exile. Robert, however, 
whom we have so frequently before mentioned as having 
gone to Jerusalem, assembling a fieet and embarking sol- 
diers, made ready an expedition, boasting that he would 
set the crown on the heads of his grand-nephews ; and 
doubtlessly he would have made good his assertion, had 
not, as we have heard from our ancestors, an adverse wind 
constantly opposed him : but assuredly this was by the hid- 
den counsel of God, in whose disposal are the powers of all 
kingdoms. The remains of the vessels, decayed through 
length of time, were still to be seen at Rouen in our days. 

CHAP. XL 

Of king Canute, [▲.d. 1017—1031.] 

Cakute began to rdign in the year of our Lord 1017, and 
reigned twenty years. Though he obtained the sovereignty 
unjustly, yet he conducted himself with great affability and 
firmness. At his entrance on the government, dividing the 
kingdom into four parts, himself took the West Saxons, Edric 
the Merdans, Thurkill the East Angles, and Eric the North-

umbrians. His first care was to punish the murderers of 
Edmund, who had, under expectation of great recompence, 
acknowledged the whole circumstances : he concealed them 
for a time, and then brought them forward in a Uurge assem- 
bly of the people, where they confessed the mode of their 
attack upon him, and were immediately ordered to execution. 
The same year, Edric, whom words are wanting to stigma- 
tize as he deserred, being, by the king's command, entrapped 
in the some snare which he had so frequently laid for others, 
breathed out his abominable spirit to helL For a quarrel 
arising, while they were angrily discoursing, Edric, relying 
on the credit of his services, and amicably, as it were, re- 
proaching the king, said, " I first deserted Edmund for your 
:»ke, and afterwards even despatched him in consequence of 
my engagonents to you." At this expression the counte- 
nance of Canute changed with indignation, and he instantly 
pronounced this sentence : ** Thou shalt die,** said he, ^' and 
justly ; since thou art guilty of treason both to Grod and me, 
by haying killed thy own sovereign, and my sworn brother ; 
thy blood be upon thy head, because thy mouth hath spoken 
against thee, and thou hast lifted thy hand against the Lord's 
anointed : " and immediately, that no tumult might be excited, 
the traitor was strangled in the chamber where they sat, and 
thrown out of the window into the river Thames : thus meet- 
ing the just reward of his perfidy. In process of time, as 
opportunities occurred, Thurkill and Eric were driven out of 
the kingdom, and sought their native land. The first, who 
had been the instigator of the murder of St. Elphege, was 
killed by the chiefs the moment he touched the Danish shore.* 
When dl England, by these means, became subject to Canute 
alone^ he began to conciliate the Angles with unceasing dili- 
gence ; allowing them equal rights with the Danes, in their 
assemblies, councils, and armies : on which account, as I 
have before observed, he sent for the wife of the late king out 
of Normandy, that, while they were paying obedience to their 
accustomed sovereign, they should the less repine at the do- 
minion of the Danes. Another design he had in view by 
this, was, to acquire favour with Richard ; who would think

tiona in their ooimtiy; in consequence of which he was ultimately de-

Kttle of hiB nq^hewa, so long m he supposed he might have 
others bj Canute. He rewired, throughout England^ the 
monasteries^ which had been partly injured, and portly de* 
stroyed by the military incursions of himself or of his lather ; 
he built churches in all the places where he had fought^ and 
more particularly at Assingdon, and appointed ministers to 
them, who, through the succeeding rerolutions of ages^ might 
pray to Gk>d for tiie souls of the persons there slain. At the 
consecration of this edifice^ himself was present, and the 
Engliidi and Danish nobility made their ofierings : it is now, 
according to report, an ordinary church, under the care c^ a 
parish priest. Over the body of the most holy Edmund, 
whom the Danes of former times had kiUed, he bmlt a church 
with princely magnifioencei appointed to it an abbat, and 
monks : and conferred on it many large estates. The great- 
ness of his donation, yet entire, stands proudly eminent at the 
present day ; for that place surpasses almost aU the monas- 
teries of England. He toc^ up, with his own hands, the 
body of St. M{^^e, which had been buried at St. Paul's in 
London, and sending it to Canterbury, honoured it with doe 
regard. Thus anxious to at<me for the ofiences of himself or 
of his predecessors, perhaps he wiped away the foul stom of 
his former crimes with God : certainly he did so with man. 
At Winchester, he displayed all the magnificence of his liber- 
ality : hers he gave so largely, that the quantity of precious 
metals astonished the minds of strangers ; and the ^ttering 
of jewels dazzled the eyes of the beholders : this was at 
Emma's suggestion, who with pious prodigality exhausted 
his treasures in works of this kind, while he was meditating 
fierce attacks on foreign lands. For his valour, incapable of 
rest, and not c<Mitented with Denmark, which he held from 
his father, and England, which he possessed by right of war, 
transferred its rage against the Swedes. These people are 
contiguous to the Danes, and had excited the displeasure of 
Canute by their ceaseless hostility. At first he fell into an 
ambush, and lost many of his people, but afterwards recruit- 
ing his strength, he routed his opponents^ and brought the 
kings of that nation, Ulf and Eglaf, to terms of peace. The 
English, at the instance of earl Grodwin, behaved nobly in 
this conflict He exhorted them, not to forget their ancient 
fame, but clearly to display their valour to their new lord :

his return home, he endrelj subdued the kingdom of Nor^

iowbig, returning with a small party into his kingdom, to 
trj the inclinations of the inhabitants, found them faithless, 
and was slain with his adherents. 

In the fifteenth year of his reign, Canute went to Rome, 
and after remaining there some time, and atoning for his 
crimes by giving alms to the several diurches, he sailed ba<^ 
to Eaglimd.* Soon after, with little difficulty, he subdued 
8c«dand, then in a state of rebelHoa, and Malcolm her king, 
by leading an army thither. I trust it will not appear use* 
lots, if I subjoin the epistle, which he transmitted to the 
English, on his departure £ram Some, by the hands of Livii^, 
abbat of Tavistock, and afterwards bishop of Crediton, to ex«- 
emplify his reformation of life, and his princely magnificence.

aunts within and without the city of Rome, wherever I could 
discover them, and there, present, to worship and adore ac-

that St. Peter, the apostle, has received from God, great 
power in binding and in loosing : that he carries the key of 
the kingdom of heaven ; and consequently I have judged

it miKtteF of special importance to seek his influence with 
God. Be it known to jou, that at the solemnitj of Easter^ 
a great assemhlj of nobles was present with pope John, 
and the emperor Conrad, that is to saj, all the princes 
of the nations frcMn mount Garganus* to the neighbourr 
ing sea. All these received me with honour, and pre-, 
sented me with magnificent gifts. But more especially was 
I honoured bj the emperor, with various gifts and offerings, in 
gold and silver vessels, and paUs and costiij garments. More- 
over, I spoke with the emperor himself, and the sovereign 
pope and the nobles who were there, concerning the wants of 
all my people, English as weU as Danes ; observing that 
there ought to be granted to them more equitable regulations^ 
and greater security on their passage to Rome ; that they 
should not be impeded by so many barriersf on the road, nor 
harassed with unjust exactions. The emperor assented to 
my request, as did Rodolph the king, who has the chief 
dominion over those barriers ; and all the princes confirmed 
by an edict, that my subjects, traders, as well as those who 
went on a religious account, should peaceably go and return 
from Rome, without any molestation fn^n wanders of bar- 
riers, or tax-gatherers. Again I complained before the pope, 
and expressed my high displeasure, that my archbishops were 
oppressed by the immense sum of money which is demanded 
from them when seeking, according to custom, the aposU^cdl 
residence to receive the pall : and it was determined that it 
should be so no longer. Moreover, all things which I re- 
quested for the advantage of my kingdom, £rom the sovereign 
pope, and the emperor, and king Bodolph, and the other 
princes, through whose territories our road to Rome is 
situated, they have freely granted, and confirmed by oath, 
under the attestation of four archbishops, and twenty bishops, 
and an innumerable multitude of dukes and nobles who 
were present. Wherefore I give most hearty thanks to Grod 
Almighty, for having successfully completed all that I had 
wished, in the manner I had designed, and fully satisfied my 
intentions. Be it known then, that since I have vowed to 
God himself, henceforward to reform my life in all things,

and justly, and pionslj to govern the kingdoms and the 
people subject to me, and to maintain equal justice in all 
things ; and have determined, through Grod's assistance, to 
rectify any thing hitherto unjustly done, either through the 
intemperance of my youth, or through negligence ; therefore 
I call to witness, and command my counseUors, to whom I 
hare entrusted the counsels of the kingdom, that they by no 
means, either through fear of myself^ or favour to any power- 
ful person, suffer, henceforth, any injustice, or cause such, to 
be done in all my kingdom. Moreover, I command all 
sherifib, or governors throughout my whole kingdom, as they 
tender my affection, or their own safety, not to conmut in- 
justice towards any man, rich or poor, but to allow all, noble 
and ignoble, alike to enjoy impartial law, from which they 
are never to deviate, either on account of royal favour, the 
person of any powerful man, or for the sake of amassing 
money for myself : for I have no need to accumulate money 
by unjust exaction. Be it known to you therefore, that re- 
turning by the same way that I went, I am now going to; 
Denmark, through the advice of all the Danes, to make peace 
>nd firm ti«at7 ^th those nations, who weiTdesirous, hiTit 
been possible, to deprive me both of life and of sovereignty : 
this, however, they were not able to perform, Grod, who by 
his kindness preserves me in my kingdom and in my honour, 
and destroys the power of all my adversaries, bringing their 
strength to nought. Moreover, when I have established 
peace with the surrounding nations, and put all our sove- 
reignty here in the East in tranquil order, so that there 
shall be no fear of war or enmity on any side, I intend 
coming to England, as early in the summer as I shall be able 
to get my fleet prepared. I have sent this epistle before me, 
in order that my people may rejoice at my prosperity ; be- 
cause, as yoursdives know, I have never spared, nor will I 
spare, either myself or my pains for the needful service of 
my whole people. I now therefore abjure all my bishops, 
and governors, throughout my kingdom, by the fidelity they 
owe to God and me, to take care that, before I come to Eng- 
land, all dues owing by ancient custom be discharged : that 
is to say, plough-alms^* the tenth of animals born in the

whether from cities or villages : and in the middle of August,

St. Martin, the first fruits of seeds, to the church of the 
parish where each one resides, which is called in English 
* Circsoet't If these and such like things are not paid he- 
fore I come to England, all who shall have offended will 
incur the penalty of a royal mukt,| to be exacted without 
lemissioB, according to law." Nor was this declaration with- 
out effect ; for he commanded all the laws which had been 
enacted bj aneient kings, and chieflj hj his predecessor 
Ethelred, to be observed for ever, under the penalty of a 
royal mulct : in the observance of which,§ the custom even 
at the present day, in the time of good kings, is to swear by 
the name of king Edward, not that he indeed app<Hnted, biu 
that he observed them. 

At that time there were in England very great and learned 
men, the principal of whom was Ethelnotib, archbishop after 
living. He was appointed primate from being dean,! and 
performed many works truly worthy to be recorded : en- 
couraging even the king himself in his good actions by the 
authority of his sanctity, and restraining him in his excesses : 
he first exalted the archiepiscopal cathedral by the presence 
of the body of St Elphege, and afterwards personally at 
Rome, restored it to its pristine dignity.^ Returning home, 
he transmitted to Coventry the arm of St. Augustine** the 
teacher, which he had purchased at Pavia, for an hundred 
talents of silver, and a talent of gold. Moreover, Canute 
took a journey to the church of Glastonbury, that he might 
visit the remains of his brother Edmund, as he used to call 

till, to be cHfftribated to the poor: it was payable in fifteen dajaftom

which moreover, in his zeal to do every thing he could for its 
honour, he rendered celebrated by many musical modulations. 
The man who has heard his chants, breathing only celestial

honour of the Virgin. Among his other works, a volume of

magnificent king Canute, for pouring out the bowels of his 
generosity in donations to the church of Chartrea 

In the fifteenth year of Canute's reign, Robert king of 
France, of whom we have before briefly spoken, departed 
this life : a man so much given to alms, that when, on festi- 
val days, he was either dressing, or putting off th^ royal 
robes, if he had nothing else at hand, he would give even

these to the poor, if his attendants did not purposely drive 
away the needy who were importuning him. He had two 
sons, Odo, and Henry : the elder, Odo,* was dull : the other 
crafty and impetuous. Each parent had severally divided 
their affections on their children : the father loved the first- 
bom, often saying that he should succeed him : the mother 
regarded the younger, to whom the sovereignty was justly 
due, if not for Ids age, yet certainly for his ability. It hap- 
pened, as women are persevering in their designs, that she 
did not cease until, by means of presents, and la^e promises,' 
she had gotten to her side all the chief nobility who are sub- 
ject to the power of France. In consequence, Henry, chiefly 
through the asssistance of Robert the Norman, was crowned 
ere his father had well breathed his last. Mindful of this 
kindness, when, as I before related, Robert went to Jerusa- 
lem, Henry most strenuously espoused the cause of William, 
his son, then a youth, against those who attempted to throw 
off his yoke. In the meantime Canute, finishing his earthly 
career, died at Shaftesbury, and was buried at Winchester.

Of king Harold and Hardecanuie, [a.d. 1036^1042.] 

In the year of our Lord's incarnation 1036,t Harold, whom 
fame:^ reported to be the son of Canute, by the daughter of 
earl Elfelm, succeeded, and reigned four years and as many 
months. He was elected by the Danes and the citizens of 
London, who, from long intercourse with these barbarians, 
had almost entirely adopted their customs. The English 
resisted for a long time, rather wishing to have one of the 
sons of Ethelred, who were then in Normandy, or else Har- 
decanute, the son of Canute by Emma, at that time in Den- 

* Though several French chronicles give nearly the lame account of 
Odo being the elder brother, the learned editon of the Recueil des Histo- 
riens de France insist that the assertion is folse. 

t '^ After the death of Canute, the kingdom was at first diyided : the 
wnrthem part fell to the share of Harold, and Hardecanute obtained the 
southern division. In the year 1037, Harold was chosen to reign over all

mark, for their Idag. The greatest stickler for justice, at 
this jtmcture, was earl Godwin ; who professing himself the 
defender of the fatherless, and having queen Emma and the 
royal treasures in his custody, for some time restrained his 
opponents by the power of his name : but at last, overcome 
by numbers and by violence, he was obliged to give way. 
Harold, secure in his sovereignty, drove his mother-in-law 
into exile. Not thinking she should be safe in Normandj, 
where, her brother and nephews being dead, disgust at the 
rule of a deserted orphan created great disorders, she passed 
over into Flanders, to earl Baldwin, a man of tried int^- 
rity: who afterwards, when king Henry died leaving a 
young son, Philip, for some years nobly governed the king- 
dom of France, and faithfully restored it to him, for he had 
married his aunt, when he came of age. Emma passed 
three years securely under the protection of this man, at 
the expiration of which, Harold dying at Oxford, in the 
month of April,* was buried at Westminster. The Danes 
and the English then imiting in one common sentiment of 
sending for Hardecanute, he came, by way of Normandy, 
into England in the month of August. For Ethelred's sons 
were held in contempt nearly by all, more from the recollec- 
tion of their father's indolence, than the power of the Danes. 
Hardecanute, reigning two years except ten days, lost his 
life amid his cups at Lambeth nigh London, and was buried 
near his father at Winchester: a young man who evinced 
great affection towards his brother and sister. For his bro- 
ther, Edward, wearied with continual wandering, revisiting 
his native land in the hope of fraternal kindness, was re- 
ceived by him with open arms, and entertained most afiec- 
tionately. He was rash, however, in other respects, and at 
the instigation of Elfric, archbishop of York, and of others 
whom I am loath to name, he ordered the dead body of 
Harold to be dug up, the head to be cut off, and thrown 
into the Thames, a pitiable spectacle to men ! but it was 
dragged up again in a fisherman's net, and buried in the 
cemetery of the Danes at London. He imposed a rigid, and 
intolerable tribute upon England, in order that he might 
pay, according to his promise, twenty marks to the soldiers

of each of his vessels. While this was horshlj levied 
throughout the kingdom^ two of the collectors, discharging 
tiieir office rather too rigorously, were killed hy the citisens 
of Worcester; upon which, huming and depopulating the 
dCy bj means of his conunanders, and plundering the pro- 
perty of the citizens, he cast a blemish on his fame and 
diminished the love of his subjects. But here I will not 
pass over in silence^ what tattlers report of Alfred the first- 
bom of Ethelred. Doubtful what to do between Harold's 
death and the arriral of Hardecanute, he came into the 
kingdom, and was deprived of his eyes by the treachery of 
his countrymen, and chiefly of Godwin, at Qillingham : from 
thence being sent to the monastery of Ely, he supported, for 
a little time, a wretched subsistence upon homely food ; all 
his companions, with the exception of the tenth, being be- 
headed : for by lot every tenth man was saved.* I have 
mentioned these circumstances, because such is the report ; 
but as the Chronicles are silent, I do not assert them for 
fact. For this reason, Hardecanute, enraged against Living, 
bishop of Crediton, whom public opinion pointed out as 
author of the transaction, expelled him from his see : but, 
soothed with money, he restored him within the year. 
Looking angrily too upon Godwin, he obliged him to clear 
himself by oath; but he, to recover his favour entirely, 
added to his plighted oath a present of the most rich and 
beautiful kind ; it was a ship beaked with gold, having 
eighty soldiers on board, who had two bracelets on either 
arm, each weighing sixteen ounces of gold ; on their heads 
were gilt helmets ; on their left shoulder they carried a Dan- 
ish axe, with an iron spear in their right hand ; and, not to 
enumerate everything, they were equipped with such arms, 
as that splendour vying with terror, might conceal the steel 
beneath the gold. But farther, as I had begun to relate, his 
sbter Gunhilda, the daughter of Canute by Emma, a young 
woman of exquisite beauty, who was sighed for, but not 
obtained, by many lovers in her father's time, was by 
Hardecanute given in marriage to Henry, emperor of the 

* The printed Saxon Chronicle has no mention of this transaction, bat 
there are two manuscripts which relate it. The story appears true in the 
main, but it is told with so much variety of time, place, Src, that it is diffi- 
cult to ascertain its real circumstances. See MSS. Cott. Tib. b. L and in

Gennans. The splendour of the nuptial pageant was yery 
striking, and is even in our times frequently sung in ballads 
about the streets : where while this renowned ladj was being 
conducted to the ship, all the nobilily of England were 
crowding around and contributing to her charges whateyer 
was contained in the general purse, or rojal treasury. Pro- 
ceeding in this manner to her husband, she cherished for a 
long time the conjugal tie ; at length being accused of adul- 
tery, she opposed in single combat to her accuser, a man of 
gigantic size, a young lad of her brother's* establishment, 
whom she had brought from England, while her other at- 
tendants held back in cowardly apprehension. When, there- 
fore, they engaged, the impeacher, through the miraculous 
interposition of God, was worsted, by being ham-strung. 
Gunhilda, exulting at her unexpect^ success, renounced the 
marriage contract with her husband; nor could she be in- 
duced either by threats or by endearments again to share his 
bed: but taking the veil of a nun, she calmly grew old in 
the service of Grod. 

This emperor possessed many and great virtues; and 
nearly surpassed in military skill all bis predecessors: so 
much 80, that he subdued the Yindelici and the Leutici,f 
and the other nations bordering on the Suevi, who alone, 
even to the present day, lust after pagan superstitions: for 
the Saracens and Turks worship God the Creator, looking 
upon Mahomet not as God, but as his prophet But the 
Yindelici worship fortune, and putting her idol in the most 
eminent situation, they place a horn in her right hand, filled 
with that beverage, made of honey and water, which by a 
Greek term we call " hydromeL** St Jerome proves, in his 
eighteenth book on Isaiah, that the Egyptians and almost 
all the eastern nations do the same. Wherefore on the last 
day of November, sitting round in a circle, they all taste 
it ; and if they find the horn full, they applaud with load 
clamours : because in the ensuing year, plenty with her

brimming horn will fulfil their wishes in everything: but 
if it be otherwise, thej lament. Hemy made these nations 
in such wise tributary to him, that upon every solemnity on 
which he wore his crown, four of their kings were obliged 
to carry a cauldron in which flesh was boiled, upon their 
shoulders, to the kitchen, by means of levers passed through 
rings. 

Frequently, when disengaged firom the turmoils of his 
empire, Henry gave himself up to good fellowship and 
merriment, and was replete with humour ; this may be 
sufficiently proved by two instances. He was so extremely 
fond of his sister, who was a nun, that he never suffered her 
to be from his side, and her chamber was always next his 
own. As he was on a certain time, in consequence of a 
winter remarkable for severe frost and snow, detained for 
a long while in the same place, a certain clerk * about the 
court, became too familiar with the girl, and often passed the 
greatest part of the night in her chamber. And although he 
attempted to conceal his crime by numberless subterf^iges, 
yet some one perceived it, for it is difficult not to betray 
guilt either by look or action, and the affiur becoming 
notorious, the emperor was the only person in ignorance, 
and who still believed his sister to be chaste. On one 
particular night, however, as they were enjoying their fond 
embraces, and continuing their pleasures longer than usual, 
the morning dawned upon them, and behold snow had com- 
pletely covered the ground. The clerk fearing that he should 
be discovered by his track in the snow, persuades his mistress 
to extricate him from his difficulty by carrying him on her 
back. She, r^ardless of modesty so that she might escape 
exposure, took her paramour on her back, and carried him out 
of the palace. It happened at that moment, that the emperor 
had risen for a necessary purpose, and looking through the 
window of his chamber, beheld the derk mounted. He was 
stupified at the first sight, but observing still more narrowly, 
be became mute with shame and indignation. While he was 
hesitating whether he should pass over the crime unpunished,

or openlj reprehend the deUnquents, there happened an 
opportunity for him to give a vacant bishopric to the clerk, 
which he did : hut at the same time whispered in his ear, 
'* Take the bishopric, but be careful jou do not let women 
carry you any more." At the same time he gave his sister 
the ride over a company of nuns, '* Be an abbess," said he» 
'^ but carry clerks no longer." Both of them were confused, 
and feeling themselves grievously stricken by so grave an 
injunction, they desisted from a crime which they thought 
revealed by God. 

He had also a clergyman about his palace, who abused the 
depth of his learning and the melody of his voice by the 
vicious propensities of the flesh, being extremely attached to 
a girl of bad character, in the town ; with whom having 
passed one festival night, he stood next morning before the 
emperor at mass, with countenance unabashed. The emperor 
concealing his knowledge of the transaction, commanded him 
to prepare himself to read the gospel, that he might be 
gratified with the melody of his voice : for he was a deacon. 
Conscious of his crime, he made use of a multitude of 
subterfuges, while the emperor, to try his constancy, still 
pressed him with messages. Refusing, however, to the veiy 
last, the emperor said, *^ Since you will not obey me in so 
easy a command, I banish you from the whole of my 
territories." The deacon, yielding to the sentence, departed 
directly. Servants were sent to foUo'w him, and in case he 
should persist in going, to bring him back after he had left 
the city. Gathering, therefore, immediately all his effects 
together, and packing them up, he had already gone a 
considerable distance, when he was brought back, not 
without extreme violence, and placed in the presence of 
Henry, who smiled and said : '^ You have done well, and I 
applaud your integrity for valuing the fear of Grod more than 
your country, and regarding the displeasure of heaven more 
than my threats. Accept, therefore, the first bishopric, which 
shall be vacant in my empire ; only renounce your dishonour- 
able amour." 

As nothing however is lasting in human eiyoyments, I 
shall not pass over in silence a certain dreadful portent 
which happened in his time. The monastery of Fulda, in 
Saxony, is celebrated for containing the body of St Gall, 



AA10I2.1 HESIBY^B BBMSFICENCS. 211 

and is enriched with very ample territories. The abbat of 
this place furnishes the emperor with sizly thousand 
warriors against his enemies ; and possesses from ancient 
times the privilege of sitting at his right hand on the most 
distinguished festivals. This Henry we are speaking of was 
celebrating Pentecost at Ments. A little before mass^ while 
the seats were preparing in the church, a quarrel arose 
between the attendants of the abbat, and those of the 
arehbishopy which of their masters should sit next the 
sovereign : one party alleging the dignity of the prelate, the 
fAher ancient usage. When words made but little for peace, 
as the Germans and Teutonians possess untractable spirits, 
they came to blows. Some snatched up staves, others threw 
stones, while the rest unsheathed their swords : finally each 
used the weapon that his anger first supplied. Thus furiously 
contending in the church, the pavement soon streamed with 
blood : but the bishops hastening forward, peace was restored 
amid the remains of the contending parties. The church was 
deansed, and mass performed with joyful sound. But now 
comes the wonder: when the sequence was chanted, and 
the choir paused at that verse, ** Thou hast made this day 
glorious : " a voice in the air replied aloud, ** I have made 
this day contentious.'' All the others were motionless with 
horror, but the emperor the more diligently attended to his 
occupation, and perceiving the satisfaction of the enemy : 
** Yon," said he, '^the inventor and also the instigator of all 
wickedness, have made this day contentious and sorrowful to 
the proud ; but we, by the grace of God, who made it 
glorious, will make it gracious to the poor." Beginning the 
sequence afresh, they implored the grace of the Holy Spirit 
by solemn lamentation. You might suppose he had come 
upon them, for some were singing, others weeping, and all 
beating their breasts. When mass was over, assembling the 
poor by means of his officers, he gave them the whole of the 
entertainment which had been prepared for himself and his 
courtiers : the emperor placing the dishes before them, 
stan^ng at a distance according to the custom of servants, 
and clearing away the fragments. 

In the time of his father, Conrad, he had received a silver 
pipe, such as boys in sport spirt water with, from a certain 
cleri^ covenanting to give him a bishopric, when he should 

p 2 



312 WXLUAX OV KAUUWBU Jtt. [a. u. c If. 

become emperor. This, when lie was of man's estate, on his 
^plication he readily gave to him. Soon after he was 
confined to his bed with severe sickness: his maladj 
increasing, he laj for three days insensible and speechless, 
while the vital breath only palpitated in his breast : nor was 
there any other sign of Hfe, than the perception of a small 
degree of breathing, on applying the hand to his nostrHs. 
The bishops being present, enjoined a fast for three days, and 
entreated heaven with tears and vows, for the Ufe of the king. 
Recovering by these remedies, as it is right to think, he sent 
for the bishop whom he had so improperly appointed, and 
deposed him by the judgment of a council : confessing, that 
for three whole days he saw malignant demons blowing fire 
upon him through a pipe ; fire so furious that ours in com- 
parison would be deemed a jest, and have no heat: that 
afterwards there came a young man half scorched, bearing a 
golden cup of immense size, full of water ; and that being 
soothed by the sight of him, and bathed by the water, the 
flame was extinguished, and he recovered his health : that 
this young man was St Laurence, the roof of whose church 
he had restored when gone to decay; and, among other 
presents, had honoured it with a golden chalice. 

Here many extraordinary things occur, which are reported 
of this man ; for instance, of a stag, which took him on its 
back, when flying from his enemies, and carried him over an 
unfordable river: and some others which I pass by because I 
am imwilling to go beyond the reader's belief. He died when 
he had completed the eighteenth year of his empire, and was 
buried at Spires, which he re-built, and called by that name, 
on the site of l^e very ancient and ruined Nonetnm : his 
epitaph is as foUows : 

Conr, as was the world onoe great,

Hence let each mortal learn his doom ; 
No gloiy can escape the tomb.

Of SL Edwardy mm of king Ethelred, [a.d. 1042-^1096.] 

Ix the year of onr Lord's incarnation 1042, St Edward, the 
sen of Ethelred, assumed the sovereignty, and held it not 
quite twenty-four years ; he was a man from the simplicity 
of his manners little calculated to govern ; but devoted to 
God, and in consequence directed by him. For while he 
eootinaed to reign, there arose no popular commotions, which 
were not immecSately quelled ; no foreign war ; all was calm 
aad peaqeable both at home and abroad ; which is the more 
a& object of wonder, because he conducted himself so mildly, 
that he would not even utter a word of reproach to the mean- 
est person. For when he had onoe gone out to hunt, and a 
countryman had overturned the standings by which the deer 
ire driven into the toils, struck with noble indignation he 
ezdaimed, *^ By God and his mother, I will serve you just 
such a turn, if ever it come in my way." Here was a noble 
mind, who forgot that he was a king, under such circum- 
itances, and could not think himself ^owed to ii]\jure a man 
even of the lowest condition. In the meantime, the regard

liis subjects entertained for him was extreme, as was also the 
fear of foreigners ; for God assisted his simplicitj, that he 
might be feared, for he knew not how to be angry. But 
however indolent or unassuming himself might be esteemed, 
he had nobles capable of eleyating him to the highest pitch : 
for instance, Siward, earl of the Northumbrians ; who^ at his 
command, engaging with Macbeth, the Scottish king, de- 
prived him both of life and of his kingdom, and placed on 
the throne Malcolm, who was the son of the king of Cmn- 
bria :* again, Leofric, of Hereford ; he, with liberal r^ard, 
defended him against the enmity of Grodwin, who trusting to 
the consciousness of his own merits, paid little reverenoe to 
the king. Leofric and his wife Gvodifa, generous in their 
deeds towards Gk)d, built many monasteries, as, GoTentty, 
St. Mary's at Stow, Wenlock, Leon, and some others ; to 
the rest he gave ornaments and estates ; to Coventry he con- 
signed his body, with a very large donation of gold and 
silver. Harold too, of the West Saxons, the son of €k)dwin ; 
who by his abi£ties destroyed two brothers, kings of the 
Welsh, Rees and Griffin ; and reduced all that barbarous 
oountiy to tiie state of a province under fealty to the king. 
(Nevertheless, there were some things which obscured the 
glory of Edward's times : the monasteries were deprived of 
their monks ; false sentences were passed by depraved men ; 
his mother^s property, at his command, was almost entirely 
taken from her. But the injustice of these transactions was 
extenuated by his favourers in the following manner : the 
ruin of the monasteries, and the iniquity of the judges, are 
said to have taken place without his knowledge^ through the 
insolence of Grodwin and his sons, who used to laugh at the 
easiness of the king : but afterwards, on being apprised of 
this, he severely avenged it by their banishmentJ hb mother

nor ever assisted him ; transferring her hereditary hatred of 
the father to the child ; for she had both loved Canute more 
when living, and more commended him when dead : besides, 
accumulating money by every method, she had hoarded it, 
regardless of the poor, to whom she would give nothing, for 
fear of diminishing her heap. Wherefore that which had

been so unjasily gathered together, was not improperly 
tiken awaj, that it might be of service to the poor, and re- 
plenish the king's exchequer. Though much credit is to be 
attached to those who relate these circumstances, yet I find 
iwr to have been a religiouslj-dispoeed woman, and to have 
expended her property on ornaments for the church of Win- 
chester, and probably upon others.* But to return : Edward 
leceiTing the mournful intelligence of the death of Hardeca- 
nute, was lost in uncertainty what to do, or whither to be- 
take himself. While he was revolving many things in his 
mind, it occurred as the better plan to submit his situation ; 
to the opinion of Godwin. To Crodwin therefore he sent ^. 
menengen, requesting, that he might in security have a ««.: 
ferenee with him. Godwin, though for a long time hesita- 
ting and reflecting, at length assented, and when Edward 
came to him and endeavoured to fall at his feet, he raised 
him up ; and when relating the death of Hardecanute, and 
begging his assistance to effect his return to Normandy, God- 
win made him the greatest promises. He said, it was better 
foe him to live with credit in power, than to die ingloriously 
in exile : that he was the son of Ethelred, the grandson of 
Edgar : that the kingdom was his due : that he was come to 
mature age, disciplined by difficulties, conversant in the art 
of well-go veming from his years, and knowing, from his for- 
mer poverty, how to feel for the miseries of the people : if he 
thought fit to rely on him, there could be no obstacle ; for 
his authority so preponderated in England, that wherever he 
inclined, there fortune was sure to favour : if he assisted 
him, none would dare to murmur ; and just so was the con- 
trary side of the question : let him then only covenant a firm 
friendship with himself ; undiminished honours for his sons, 
and a marriage with his daughter, and he who was now 
shipwrecked dimost of life and hope, and imploring the as ' 
sistance of another, should shortly see himself a king. 

There was nothing which Edward would not promise, from 
the exigency of the moment : so^ pledging fidelity on both 
sides, he confirmed by oath every thing which was demanded. 
Soon after convening an assembly at Gillingham, Godwin,

times, or out of pure regard to chastity: yet it is most 
notoriously affirmed, that he never violated his purity by 
Qonnexion with any woman.

because the tmtk of the facts hangs in suspense. It is 'to he 
observed, that the king had sent for several Normans, who 
had formerly slightlj ministered to his wants when in exile. 
Among these was Robert, whom, from being a monk of 
Jumieges, he had appointed bishop of London, and after- 
wards archbishop (Of Canterbury. The English of our times 
viHiy this person,' together with the rest, as being the im- 
^eacber of Godwin and his scms ; the sower of discord ; the 
purohaser of the archbishopric: thej say toc^ that Godwiii 
snd his sons were men of liberal mind, the stedfast pro* 
moters and defenders of the govenunent of £dward; and 
that it was not to be wondered at, if they were hurt at see- 
ii^ men of yesterday, and strangers, preferred to themselves: 
still, that they never uttered even a harsh word against the 
king, whom they had formerly exalted to the throne. On 
the opposite huid the Normans thus defended themselves: 
they all^e, that both hisuself and his sons acted with the 
greatest want of respect, as well as fidelity, to the king and 
his party ; aiming at equal sovereignty with him ; often ridi* 
eoling his simplicity; often hurli^ the shafts of their wit 
against him : that the Normans could not endure this, but 
endeavoured to weaken their power as much as possible; 
and that God manifested, at last, with what kind of purity 
Godwin had served liim. For, after his piratical ravages^ 
of which we shall speak hereafter, when he had been reinr 
rtted in his original favour, «id was sitting with the king 
at table, the conversation turning on Alfired, the king's 
brother, " I perceive," said he, " O king, that on every 
recollection of your brother, you regard me with angry coun- 
tenance ; but God forbid that I should swallow this morsel, 
if I am conscious of any thing which might tend, either to 
his danger or your disadvantage." On saying this, he was 
choked with the piece he had put into his mouth, and closed 
his eyes in death : being dragged from under the table by 
Harold his son, who stood near the king, he was buried in 
the cathedral of Winchester. 

On account of these feuds, as I have observed, my narra- 
tive labours Under difficulties, for I cannot precisely ascertain 
the truth, by reason either of the natural dislike of these 
oatioxis for each other, or because the English disdainfully 
hear with a suparior, and the Normans canM^t endure aa '

eqnaL In the following book, however, when the oppor- 
tunity occurs for relating the arrival of the Normans in 
England, I shall proceed to speak of their habits ; at present 
I shall glance, with all possible truth, at the grudge of the 
king against Godwin and his sons. 

Eustace, * earl of Boulogne, the father of Grodfrey and 
Baldwin, who, in our times, were kings of Jerusalem, had 
married the king's sister, Groda, who had borne a son, named 
Ralph, to her former husband, Walter of Mantes. This son, 
at that time earl of Hereford, was both indolent and cow- 
ardlj ; he had been beaten in battle bj the Welsh, and left 
his county and the city, together with the bishop^ to be con- 
sumed with fire by the enemy ; the disgrace of which trans- 
action was wiped off by the valour of Harold, who arrived 
opportunely. Eustace, therefore, crossing the channel, from 
Whitsand to Dover, went to king Edward on some unknown 
business. When the conference was over, and he had ob- 
tained his request, he was returning through Canterbury, f 
where one of his harbingers, dealing too fiercely with a citi- 
zen, and demanding quarters with blows,- rather than en- 
treaty or remuneration, irritated him to such a degree, that 
he put him to dealh. Eustace, on being informed of the 
fact) proceeded with all his retinue to revenge the murder of 
his servant, and killed the perpetrator of the crime, together 
with eighteen others : but the citizens flying to arms, he lost 
twenty-one of his people, and had multitudes wounded; 
himself and one more with difficulty making their escape 
during the confusion. Thence returning to court and pro- 
curing a secret audience, he made the most of his own story, 
and excited the anger of the king against the English. God- 
win, being summoned by messengers, arrived at the palace. 

* Eastace II, fuinamed Aux Orenmu. He succeeded bis father, 
Eustace I, in 1049 ; and married, in 1050, GodsL, daughter of king Etliel- 
bert, and widow of Gauthier comte de Mantes, by whom he bad no issue ; 
but by his wife Ida he left three sons; Eustace, who succeeded himt 
Godefroi, created, in 1076, marquis d'Anvers by the emperor Heniy lY, 
and afterwards due de Bouillon, was elected king of Jerusalem in 1099, 
(23rd July) ; and, dying 18th July, 1100, was succeeded by his brother 
Baudouin, comte d'Edeese. — Ha&dt. 

f He means Doyer; according to the Sazon Chronicle, from which he 
borrows the account. Eustace stopped at Canterbury to refresh himselfs 
and his people, and afterwards set out for DoYer.->Sax. Chron. page 42U

When the business was related, and the king was dwelling 
more particalarlj on the insolence of the citizens of Canter- 
bnrj, this intelligent man perceived that sentence onght not 
to be pronounced, since the allegations had only been heard 
on one side of the question. In consequence, though the 
king ordered him directly to proceed with an annj into 
Kent, to take signal vengeance on the people of Canterbury, 
BtiU he refused : both because he saw with displeasure, that 
all foreigners were gaining fast upon the favour of the king ; \ 
and because he was desirous of evincing his regard to his 
countrymen. Besides, his opinion was more accordant, as it 
should seem, with equity, which was, that the principal 
people of that town should be mildly summoned to the kii^s 
court, on account of the tumult; if they could exculpate 
themselves, they should depart unhurt; but if they could 
not, they must make atonement, either by money, or by cor- 
poral punishment, to the king, whose peace they had broken, 
and to the earl, whom they had injured: moreover, that it 
speared unjust to pass sentence on those people unheard, 
who had a more especial right to protection. Alter this the 
conference broke up ; Godwin paying little attention to the 
indignation of the king, as merely momentary. In conse- 
quence of this, the nobility of the whole kingdom were com- 
manded to meet at Gloucester, that the business might there 
be canvassed in full assembly. Thither came those, at that 
time, most renowned Northumbrian earls, Siward and 
Le(^c, and all the nobility of England. Godwin and his 
aons alone, who knew that ^ey were suspected, not deeming 
it prudent to be present unarmed, halted with a strong force 
at Beverstone, giving out that they had assembled an army 
to restrain the Welsh, who, meditating independence on the 
king, had fortified a town in the county of Hereford, where 
Sweyn, one of the sons of Godwin, was at that time in com- 
mand. The Welsh, however, who had come beforehand to 
the conference, had accused them of a conspiracy, and ren- 
dered them odious to the whole court; so that a rumour 
prevailed, that the king's army would attack them in that 
very place. Godwin, hearing this, sounded the alarm to his 
party ; told them that they should not purposely withstand 
their sovereign lord ; but if it came to hostilities, they should 
not retreat without avenging themselves. And, if better

toonnsebi had not intervened, a dreadful scene of miser j, and 
a worse ^an civil war, wt>uld have ensued. Some small 
share of tranquillity, however, bdng restored, it was ordered 
that the oouncil should be again assembled at London ; and 
that Sweyn, the son of Grodwin, should appease the king's 
anger bj withdrawing himself: that Grodwin and Harold 
should come as speedily as possible to the council, with this 
condition: that they^. should be unarmed, bring with them 
only twelve men, and deEver up to the king the ooimmand of 
the troops which they had throughout S^gknd. This on 
the other hand they refused ; observing, that they could not 
go to a party-meeting without sureties and pledges; that 
they would obey their lord in the surraider of the soldiers, 
as well as in every thing else, except risking their lives and 
reputation : should they come unarmed, the loss of life m^ht 
be apprehended; if attended with few followers, it would 
detract from their glory. The king had made up his mind 
too firmly, to listen to the entreaties of those who interceded 
with him; wherefore an edict was published, that they 
should depart from England within five days. Godwin and 
Sweyn retired to Flanders, and Harold to Ireland. His eari- \ 
dom was given to Elgar, the son of Leofric, a man of active 
habits ; who^ receiving, governed it with ability, and readily 
restored it to him on his return; and afterwards, on the 
death of Godwin, when Harold had obtained the dnkadom 
of his father, he boldly reclaimed it, though, by the accusa- 
tion of his ^Mmiea^ be was banished for a time. All the 
property of the queen was seieed, and herself delivered into 
the custody of the king's sister at Wherweil, lest she alone 
should be void of care, whilst aU her relations were sighing 
for their country. 

The following year, the exiles, each emerging from bi» 
station, were now cruisizig the British sea, infesting the 
coast with piracy, and carrying off rich booty .{rom the sob- 
stance of their countrymen. Against these, on the king's 
part, more than sixty sail lay at anchor. Earls Odo and 
Balph, relations of the kins, were commanders of the fleet 
Nor did this emergency find Edward himself inactive ; smoe 
lie would pass the night on ship-board, and watch the saDies 
of the plunderers ; cUligently compensating, by the wisdom 
of his counsel, for that personal service which age and in^

irndty denied. Bat when ihey had approached each other, 
and the conflict was on the eve of commencing, a very thick 
mist aroae, which in a moment obscured the sight of the 
opponents, and repressed the pitiable audacity of men. At 
last Grodwin and his companions were driven, by the im- 
petuosity of the wind, to the port they had left ; and not long 
after returning to their own country with pacific dispositions, 
they found the king at London, and were receiyed by him on 
soliciting pardon. The old man, skilled in leading ^e minds 
of hia audience by his reputation and his eloquence, dex- 
terously exculpated himself from every thing laid to his 
charge ; and in a short time prevailed so far, as to recover 
his honours, ludiminished, for himself and for his children ; 
to drive all the Normans, branded with ignominy, from Eng- 
land ; and to get sentence passed on Robert, the archbishop, 
and his accomplices, for disturbing the order of the king- 
dom and stimulating the royal mind against his subjects. 
But he, not waiting for violent measures, had fled of his own 
accord while the peace was in agitation, and proceeding to 
Borne, and appealing to the apostolical see on his case, as he 
was returning through Jumi^ges, he died there, and was 
buried in the church of St. Mary, which he chiefly had built 
at vast expense. While he was yet living, Stigand, who 
was bishop of Winchester, forthwith invaded the archbishopric 
of Canterbury : a prelate of notorious ambition, who sought 
after honours too keenly, and who, through desire of a 
higher dignity, deserting the bishopric of the South Saxons, 
had occupied Winchester, which he held with the arch- 
bishopric. For this reason he was never honoured with the 
pall by the papal see, except that one Benedict, the usurper, 
as it were, of the papacy, sent him one ; either corrupted by 
money to grant a thing of this kind, or else beo^use bad 
people are pleased to gratify others of the same description. 
But he, through the zeal of the faithful, being expelled by 
Nicholas, who legally assumed the papacy from being bishop 
of Florence, laid aside the title he so little deserved. Sti- 
gand, moreover, in the time of king William, degraded by 
the Roman cardinals and condemned to perpetual imprison- 
ment, could not fill up the measure of his insatiable avidity 
even in death. For on his decease, a small key was dis- 
covered among his secrot recesses, which on being applied to

the lock of a chamber-cabinet^ gave evidence of papers, de- 
scribing immense treasures, and in which were noted both 
the. qualitj and the quantity of the precious metals which 
this greedj pilferer had hidden on all his estates : but of this 
herea^r : I shall now complete the history of Grodwin which 
I had begun. 

When he was a young man he had Canute's sister to wife, 
by whom he had a son, who in his early youth, while proudly 
curveting on a horse which his grandfather had given him, 
/ was carried into the Thames, and perished in the stream : 
' his mother, too, paid the penalty of her cruelty ; being killed 
by a Stroke of lightning. For it is reported, that she was in 
the habit of purchasing companies of slaves in England, and 
sending them into Denmark ; more especially girls, whose 
beauty and age rendered them more valuable, that she might 
accumulate money by this horrid traffic. After her death, 
he married another wife,* whose descent I have not been 
able to trace ; by her he had Harold, Sweyn, Wulnod, 
Tosty, Girth, and Leofwine. Harold became king for a few 
months after Edward ; and being overcome by William aX 
Hastings, there lost his life and kingdom, together with his 
two yoiuger brothers. Wulnod, given by his father as an 
hostage, was sent over to Normandy by king Edward, where 
he remained all that king's time in inextricable captivity ; and 
being sent back into England during William's reign, grew 
old in confinement at Salisbury : Sweyn being of an obsti- 
nate disposition, and faithless to the king, frequently revolted 
from hb father, and his brother Harold, and turning pirate^ 
tarnished the virtues of his forefathers, by his depredations 
on the coast : at last struck with remorse for the murder of 
Bruno^t a relation, or as some say, his brother, he went to 
Jerusalem, and returning thence was surprised by the Sara- 
cens, and put to death : Tosty, after the death of Siward, 
was preferred to the earldom of Northumbria by king Ed-

f Sweyn had debauched an abbess, and being enraged thai he was not 
allowed to i-etain her as his wife, he fled to Flanden. Shortlj after be 
returned, and intreated Bruno or Beom to accompany him to the kix^ and 
to intercede for his pardon : but it should seem ibm was a mere pretence ; 
as he forced him on ship-board, and then put him to death. V. Flor.

ward, an4 presided over that province for neorlj ten years ; 
at the end of which he impelled the Northumbrians to rebel, 
hj the asperity of his manners. For finding him unattended, 
they drove him from the district ; not deeming it proper to 
Idll him, from respect to his dignity : but they put to death 
his attendants both English and Danes, appropriating to 
their own use, his horses, his arms, and his effects. As soon 
as this rumour, and the distracted state of the country reached 
the king, Harold set forward to avenge the outrage. The 
Northumbrians, though not inferior in point of numbers, yet 
preferring peace, excused themselves to him for the transac- 
tion ; averring, that they were a people free-bom, and freely 
educated, and unable to put up with the cruelty of any 
prince ; that they had been taught by their ancestors either 
to be free, or to die ; did the king wish them to be obedient,, 
he should appoint Morcar, the son of Elgar, to preside over 
them, who would experience how cheerfully they could obey, 
provided they were treated with gentleness. On hearing 
this, Harold, who regarded the quiet of the country more 
than the advantage of his brother, recalled his army, and, 
after waiting on the king, settled the earldom on Morcar. 
Testy, enraged against every one, retired with his wife and 
children to Flanders, and continued there till the death of 
Edward : but this I shall delay mentioning, while I record 
what, as I have learned from ancient men, happened in his 
time at Rome. 

Pope Gregory the Sixth,* first called Gratian, was a man q 
of equal piety and strictness. He found the power of the 
Roman pontificate so reduced by the negligence of his pre- 
decessors, that, with the exception of a few neighbouring 
towns, and the offerings of the faithful, he had scarcely any- 
thing whereon to subsist. The cities and possessions at a 
distance, which were the property of the church, were for- 
fnbly seized by plunderers ; the public roads and highways 
throughout all Italy were thronged with robbers to such a 
degree, that no pilgrim could pass in safety unless strongly 

* ** Pagi places the commencement of Gregonr's papacy in liiaj 1044, 
but UghelU cites a charter m which the month of August, 1045, Is stated 
to be in the first year of his pontificate. He was deposed at a council held 
at Sutri, on Christmaa-day, a.d. 1046, for having obtained the holy see by 
•invmy. Mr. Sharpe remarks that Malmeabary's character of this pope is 
wondered as apocryphal. Compare Rodul QIaber, lib. r. c 5.'* — Habdt.

gaarded. Swanns of thieves beset erery path, nor could 
tiie traveller devise anj method of escaping them. Their 
rage was equally bent against the poor and the rich ; en- 
treaty or resistance were alike unavailing. The journey to 
Bome was discontinued by every nation, as each had much 
rather contribute his money to the churches in his own 
country, than feed a set of plunderers with the produce of 
his labours. And what was the state of that city which of 
old was the only dwelling-place of holiness ? Why there an 
abandoned set of knaves and assassins thronged the very 
forum. If any one by stratagem eluded the people who lay 
in wait upon the road, from a desire even at the peril of de- 
struction to see the church of the apostle ; yet then, encoun- 
tering these robbers, he was never able to return home with- 
out the loss either of property or of life. Even over the 
very bodies of the holy apostles and martyrs, even on the sacred 
altars were swords unsheathed, knd the offerings of pilgrims, 
ere well laid out of their hands, were snatched away and 
consumed in drunkenness and fornication. By such evils 
was the papacy of Gregory beset. At first he began to deal 
gently with his subjects ; and, as became a pontiff, rather by 
love than by terror ; he repressed the delinquents more by 
words than by blows ; he entreated the townsmen to abstain 
from the molestation of pilgrims, and the plunder of sacred 
ofiTerings. The one, he said, was oontraiy to nature, that 
the man who breathed the common air could not enjoy the 
conunon peace ; that Christians surely ought to have liberty 
of proceeding whither they pleased among Christians, since 
they were all of the same household, all united by the tie of 
the same blood, redeemed by the same price : the other, he 
said, was contrary to the command of God, who had 
ordained, that " they who served at the altar, should live by 
the altar ;" moreover, that '* the house of God ought to be 
the house of prayer, not a den of thieves,** nor an assembly 
of gladiators ; that they should allow the offerings to go to 
the use of the priests, or the support of the poor ; that he 
would provide for those persons whom want had compelled 
to plunder, by giving them some honest employment to pro- 
cure^ their subsistenoe ; that such as were instigated by 
avaricious desire, should desist immediately for the love of 
God and the credit of the world. He invited, by mandatea 



loeso CHASAOTBB OW GBBGOBT YL 225 

and epistlea, those who had inraded the patrimonj of the 
ehujch, to restore what did not helong to them, or else to 
prove in the Rotoan senate, that they held it justly ; if they 
would do neither, tibiey must he told that they were no longer 
members of the church, since they oppos^ St. Peter, the 
head of the church, and his vicar. Perpetually haranguing 
to tills effect, and little or nothing profiting hy it, he endea- 
voured to cure the inveterate disorder hy having recoui*se to 
harsher remedies. He then separated from the body of the 
church, by the brand of exconmiunication, all who were 
guilty of such practices, and even those who associated or 
conversed with the delinquents. Though he acted strictly 
according to his duty, yet his diligence in this business had 
well nigh proved his destruction ; for as one says, " He who 
accuses a mocker, makes himself an enemy," so the aban- 
doned crew b^an to kick against this gentle admonition; 
to utter their threats aloud; to dash their anns around 
the walls of the city, so as nearly even to kill the pope. 
Finding it now absolutely necessary to cut short the evil, 
be procured arms and horses from every side, and equipped 
Izoops of horse and foot. Taking possession, in the first 
plai^ of the church of St. Peter, he either killed or put 
to flight the plunderers of the oblations. As fortune 
appeared to favour his designs, he proceeded farther; and 
despatching all who dared resist, restored to their original 
jariiBdiction all the estates and towns which had been fbr a 
considerable time lost. In this manner, peace, which had 
been long driven into banishment by the negligence of many, 
was restored to the .country by the exertions of an indivi- 
duaL Pilgrims now began securely to travel on the public 
ways, which had been deserted ; they feasted their eyes with 
pleasure on the ancient wonders witibin the city ; and, hav- 
ing made their offerings, they returned home with songs of 
joy. In the meantime the common people of Rome, who 
bad been accustomed to live by theft, began to call him san* 
g;Qinary, and not worthy to offer sacrifice to God, since he 
-was stained by so many murders ; and, as it genially hap- 
pens that the contagion of slander spreads universally, even 
the cardinals themselves joined in the sentiments of the peo- 
ple ; so that) when this holy man was confined by the sick- 
.which proved his death, they, after consulting among

themselyes, with matchless insolence recommended him not 
to think of ordering himself to he huried in the church of 
St Peter with the rest of the popes, since he had polluted 
his office hy heing accessory to the death of so manj men. 
Besuming spirit, however, and sternly regarding them, he 
addressed them in the following manner : 

*' If you possessed either a single spark of human reason, 
or of the knowledge of divine truth, you would hardly have 
approached your pontiff with so inconsiderate an address ; 
for, throughout my whole life, I have dissipated my own 
patrimony for your advantage, and at last have sacrificed the 
applause of the world for your rescue. If any other ^rsons 
were to allege what you urge in defamation of me, it would 
become you to silence them by explaining away the false 
opinions of foob. For whom, I pray you, have I laid up 
treasure ? For myself perhaps ? and yet I already possessed 
the treasures of my predecessors, which were enough for 
any man's covetousness. To whom have I restored safety 
and liberty ? You will reply, to myself perhaps ? And yet 
I was adored by the people, and did, without restraint, what- 
ever I pleased; entire orations teemed with my praises; 
every day resounded my applause. These praises and these 
applauses have been lost to me, through my concern for your 
poverty. Towards you I turned my thoughts; and found 
that I must adopt severer measures. A* sacrilegious robber 
fattened on the produce of your property, while your subsist- 
ence was only from day to day. He, from the offerings be- 
longing to you, was dad in costly silk ; while yon, in mean 
and tattered clothing, absolutely grieved my sight. In con- 
sequence, when I could endure this no longer, I acted with 
hostility to others, that I might get credit for the clergy, 
though at the loss of the citizens. However, I now find I 
have lavished my favours on the ungrateful ; for you publicly 
proclaim what others mutter only in secret. I approve, in- 
deed, your freedom, but I look in vain for your affection. A 
dying parent is persecuted by his sons concerning his bnriaL 
Will you deny me the house common to all living? The 
harlot, the usurer, the robber, are not forbidden an entrance 
to the church, and do you refuse it to the pope ? What sig- 
nifies it whether the dead or the living enter the sanctuary, 
except it be, that the living is subject to many temptations^

80 that he cannot he free from spot erea in the church ; of^n 
finding matter of sin in the verj place where he had come to 
wash it awaj ; whereas the dead knows not how, naj, he 
frho wants onlj his last sad office, has not the power to sin. 
What savage harharitj then is it to exdnde from the house 
of Grod him in whom both the inclination and the power of 
aimdng have ceased ! Repent, then, my sons, of jour preci- 
IMtate boldness, if perchance God maj forgive jou this 
crime, for you have spoken both foolishly and bitterly even to 
this present hour. But that you may not suppose me to rest 
merely on my own authority, listen to reason. Every act of 
man ought to be considered according to the intention of his 
heart, that the examination of the deed may proceed to that 
point whence the design originated; I am deceived if the 
Truth does not say the same ; * If thine eye be simple thy 
-vrhole body shall be full of light ; if evil, all thy body shall 
be darL' A wretched pauper hath often come to me to re- 
lieve his distress. As I knew not what was about to happen, 
I have presented him with divers pieces of money, and dis- 
missed him. On his departure he has met with a thief on 
the public road, has incautiously fallen into conversation 
^th him, proclaimed the kindness of the apostolical see, 
and, to prove the truth of his words, produced the purse. 
On their journey the way has been b^uiled with various 
discourse, until the dissembler, loitering somewhat behind, 
has felled the stranger with a club, and immediately des- 
patched him ; and, after caiTying off his money, has boasted 
of a murder which his thirst for plunder had excited. Can 
JOQ9 therefore, justly accuse me for giving that to a stranger 
which was the cause of his death ? for even the most cruel 
person would not murder a man unless he hqped to fill his 
pockets with the money. What shall I say <^ civil and 
ecclesiastical laws ? By these is not the selfsame fact both 
punbhed and approved under different circumstances ? The 
thief is punished for murdering a man in secret, whereas the 
soldier is applauded who destroys his enemy in battle ; the 
homicide, then, is ignominious in one and laudable in the 
other, as the latter committed it for the safety of his country, 
the former for the gratification of his desire for plunder. 
My predecessor Adrian the First, of renowned memory, was 
applauded for giving up the investiture of the churches tp

from the princes. What at that time, then, might reason* 
ably be granted, maj at the present be reasonably taken 
awaj. But whj so ? Because the mind of Charles the 
Great was not assailable bj avarice, nor could any person 
easily find access unless he entered by the door. Besides, at 
so rast a distance, it could not be required of the papal see 
to grant its consent to each person elected, so long as there 
was a king at hand who disposed of nothing through avarice, 
but always appointed religious persons to the churches^ ac- 
cording to the sacred ordinances of the canons. At the 
present time luxury and ambition have beset every king's 
palace; wherefore the spouse of Christ deservedly asserts 
her liberty, lest a tyrant should prostitute to an ambitious 
usurper. Thus, on either side, may my cause be denied or 
affirmed; it is not the office of a bishop either himself to 
fight) or to command others to do so; but it belongs to a 
bishop's function, if he see innocence made shipwreck of, to 
oppose both hand and tongue. Ezekiel accuses the priests 
for not strongly opposing and holding forth a shield for the 
house of Israel in the day of the Lord. Now there are two 
persons in the church of God, appointed for the purpose of 
repressing crimes ; one who can rebuke sharply ; the other, 
who can wield the sword. I, as you can witness for me, 
have not neglected my part ; as far as I saw it could profit, 
I did rebuke sharply. I sent a message to him whose busi- 
ness it was to bear the sword ; he wrote me word back, that 
he was occupied in his war with the Vandals, entreating me 
not to spare my labour nor his expense in breaking up the 
meetings of the plunderers. K I had refused, what excuse 
could I offer to God after the emperor had delegated his 
office to me ? Could I see the murder of the townspeople, 
the robbery of the pilgrims, and slumber on ? But he who 
spares a thief, kills the innocent Yet it will be objected 
that it is not the part of a priest to defile himself with the 
blood of any one : I grant it. But he does not defile him- 
self, who frees the innocent by the destruction of the guilty. 
Blessed, truly blessed, are they who always keep judgment

and do justice. Fhineas and Mattathias were prieste moBt 
renowned in fame, both crowned with the sacred mitre^ and 
both habited in sacerdotal garb ; and yet thej both punished 
the wicked with their own hands. The one transfixed the 
guilty couple with a jayelin : the other mingled the blood of 
the sacrificer with the sacrifice. If then those persons, re- 
garding, as it were, the thick darkness of the law, were, 
through divine zeal, transported for mysteries, the shadows 
only of those which were to be ; shall we^ who see the truth 
witii perfect clearness, suffer our sacred things to be pro- 
fimed? Azarias the priest drove away king Ozias, when 
oflfering incense, and no doubt would have killed him, had he 
not quickly departed ; the divine vengeance, however, anti- 
cipated the hand of the priest, for a leprosy preyed on the 
body of the man whose mind had coveted unlawful things ; 
the devotion of a king was disturbed, and shall not the de- 
miea of a thief be so ? It is not enough to excuse, I even 
applaud this my conduct ; indeed I have conferred a benefit 
on the very persons I seem to have destroyed. I have 
diminished their punishment in accelerating their deaths. 
The longer a wicked man lives the more he will sin, unless 
he be such as God hath graciously reserved for a singular 
•example. Death in general is good for all ; for by it the 
just man finds repose in heaven, — ^the unjust ceases from his 
crinies, — the bad man puts an end to his guilt, — ^the good 
proceeds to his reward, — the saint approaches to the palm, — 
the sinner looks forward to pardon, because death has fixed 
a boundary to his transgressions. They then surely ought 
to thank me, who through my conduct have been exempted 
from BO many sufferings. I have urged these matters in my 
own defence, and to invalidate your assertions : however, 
since both your reasoning and mine may be fallacious, let us 
commit aU to the decision of God. Place my body, when 
laid out in the manner of my predecessors, before the gates 
of the church ; and let them be secured with locks and bars. 
If Grod be willing that I should enter, you will hail a 
miracle ; if not, do with my dead body according to your 
inclination.^ 

Struck by this address, when he had breathed his last, 
they carried out the remains of the departed prelate before 
the doors, which were strongly fastened; and presently a

whirlwind, sent bj Grod, broke every opposing bolt» and 
drove the very doors, with the utmost violence, against the 
waUs. The surrounding people applaud with joj, and the 
bodj of the pontiff was interred, with all due respect^ by 
the si de of the other popes. 

Lt the same time something similar occurred in England, 
I not by divine miracle, but b y infernal craft ; which whMi I 
shall have related, the credit of the narrative will not be 
shaken, though the minds of the hearers should be incredu- 
lous ; for I have heard it from a man of such character, who 
swore he had seen it, that I should blush to disbdieve. 
There resided at Berkeley a woman addicted to witchcraft, 
as it afterwards appeared, and skilled in ancient augury : she 
was excessively gluttonous, perfectly lascivious, setting no 
bounds to her debaucheries, as she was not old, though fast 
declining in life. On a certain day, as she was regaiingy a 
jack-daw, which was a very great favourite, chattered a 
little more loudly than usual. On hearing which the wo- 
man's knife fell from her hand, her countenance grew pale, 
and deeply groaning, '^ This day," sdd she, " my plough has 
completed its last furrow ; to-day I shall hear (^ and suffer, 
some dreadful calamity .'^ While yet speaking, the messenger 
of her misfortunes arrived; and being asked, why he ap- 
proached with so distressed an air ? ^' I bring news," said he, 
"from that village," naming the place, '^of the death of your 
son, and of the whole family, by a sudden accident." At 
this intelligence, the woman, sorely afflicted, immediately 
took to her bed, and perceiving the disorder rapidly ap» 
proaching the vitals, she summoned her surviving childrcsi, 
a jtnonk, and SAun, by hasty letters ; and, when they arrived, 
with faltering voice, addressed them thus : " Formerly, my 
children, I constantly administered to my wretched circum- 
stances by demonia<^ arts : I have been the sink of every 
vice, the teacher of every allurement : yet, while practising 
these crimes, I was accustomed to soothe my hapless soul 
with the hope of your piety. Desx)airing of myself I rested 
my expectations on you; I advanced you as my defenderB 
against evil spirits, my safeguards against my strongest foea. 
Now, since I have approached the end of my life, and shall 
have those eager to punish, who lured me to sin, I entre«t 
you by your mother's breasts, if you have any regard, aay

afiectaon, at leaat to endeavour to alleviate 107 torments; 
and, although jou cannot revoke the sentence already passed 
upon mj soul, yet you may, perhaps, rescue my body, by 
these means : sew up my corpse in the skin of a stag ; lay * 
it on its back in a stone coffin ; fasten down the lid with lead 
and iron ; on this lay a stone, bound round with three iron 
chains of enormous weight; let there be psalms sung for 
fifty nights, and masses said for an equal number of days, 
to allay the ferocious attacks of my adversaries. If I lie 
thus secure for three nights, on the fourth day bury your 
mother in the groimd ; although I fear, lest the earth, which 
has been so often burdened with my crimes, should refuse to 
receive and cherish me in her bosom." They did their ut- 
most to comply with her injunctions: but alas! vain were 
pious tears, vows, or entreaties; so. great was the woman's 
guilt, so great the devil's violence. For on the first two 
nights, while the choir of priests was singing psalms around 
the body, the devils, one by one, with the utmost ease 
bursting open the door of the church, though closed with 
an immense bolt, broke asunder the two outer chains; the 
middle one being more laboriously wrought, remained entire. 
On the third night, about cock-crow, the whole monastery 
seemed to be overthrown &om its very foundation, by the 
damour of the approaching enemy. One devil, more ter- 
rible in appearance than the rest, and of loftier stature, 
broke the gates to shivers by the violence of his attack.' 
The priests grew motionless with fear,* their hair stood on 
end, and they became speechless. He proceeded, as it ap- 
peared, with haughty step towards the coffin, and calling on 
the woman by name, commanded her to rise. She replying 
that she could not on account of the chains : ** You shall be 
loosed," said he, "and to your cost:" and directly he broke 
the chain, which had mocked the ferocity of the others, with 
as little exertion as though it had been made of fiax. He 
also beat down the cover of the coffin with his foot, and 
taking her by the hand, before them all, he dragged her out . 
of tibe church. At the doors appeared a black horse, proudly 
neighing, with iron hooks projecting over his whole back ; 
on which the wretched creature was placed, and, imme- 
diately, with the whole party, vanished from the eyes of the

beholders; her pitiable criee, however, for assistancey were 
heard for nearly the space of four miles. No person wiU 
deem this incredible, who has read St. Gregory's Dialogues ;* 
who tells, in his fourth book, of a wicked man that had been 
buried in a church, and was cast out of doors again by 
devils. Among the French also^ what I am about to relate 

\ is frequently mentioned. Charles Martel, a man of re- 
Tiowned valour, who obliged the Saracens, when they had 
invaded France, to retire to Spain, was, at his death, buried 
in the church of St. Denys ; but as he had seized much of 
the property of almost all the monasteries in France for the 
purpose of paying his soldiers, he was visibly taken away 
from his tomb by evil spirits, and has nowhere been seen 
to his day. At length this was revealed to the bishop of 

\ Orleans, and by him publicly made known. 

VS^ut to return to Rome : there was a citizen of this place, 
youthful, rich, and of senatorial rank, who had recently 
married; and, who calling together his companions, had 
made a plentiful entertainment. After the repast, when by 
moderate drinking they had excited hilarity, they went out 
into the field to promote digestion, either by lei^ing, or 
hurling, or some other exercise. The master of the ban- 
quet, who was leader of the game, called for a ball to play 
with, and in the meantime placed the wedding ring on the 
outstretched finger of a brazen statue which stood close at 
hand. But when almost all the others had attacked him 
alone, tired with the violence of the exercise, he left ofiT 
playing first, and going to resume his ring, he saw the fin- 

' ger of the statue clenched fast in the palm. Finding, after 
many attempts, that he was unable either to force it off, or 
to break the finger, he retired in silence; concealing the 
matter from his companions, lest they should laugh at him 
at the moment, or deprive him of the ring when he was 
gone. Returning thither with some servants in the dead of 
night, he was surprised to find the finger again extended, 
and the ring taken away. Dissembling his loss, he was 
soothed by the blandishments of his bride. When the hour 
of rest arrived, and he had placed himself by the side of his 
spouse, he was conscious of something dense, and cloud-like, 
rolling between them, which might be felt, though not seen,

and bj this means was impeded in his embraces : he heard a 
voice too^ sajing, ''Embrace me, since jou wedded me to- 
day ; I am Venus, on whose finger jou put the ring ; I have 
it, nor will I restore it." Tenifif^ at such a prodigy, he 
had neither courage, nor ability to reply, and passed a sleep* 
less night in silent reflection upon the matter. A consider- 
able space of time elapsed in this way : as often as he was 
desirous of the embraces of his wife, the same circumstance > 
ever occurred ; though in other respects, he was perfectly t 
equal to any avocation, dvil or military. At length, urged ^ 
by the complaints of his consort, he detailed the matter to 
her parents; who^ after deliberating for a time, disclosed it 
to one Palumbus, a suburban priest. This man was skilled i 
in necromancy, could raise up magical figures, terrify devils^ 
and impel them to do anything he chose. Making an agree- 
ment, that he should fill his purse most plentifully, provided 
he succeeded in rendering the lovers happy, he called up all 
the powers of his art, and gave the young man a letter 
which he had pr^>ared; saying, ''Go, at such an hour of 
tbe night, into the high road, where it divides into four., 
several ways, and stand there in silent expectation. There 
will pass by hunum figures of either sex, of every age, rank, 
and condition ; some on horseback, some on foot ; some with 
countenances dejected, others elated with full-swollen inso- 
lence ; in short, you wiU perceive in their looks and gestures, 
every symptom both of joy and of grief: though these should 
address you, enter into conversation with none of them. 
This company will be followed by a person taller, and more 
corpulent thtm the rest, sitting in a chariot ; to him you will, 
in silence^ give the letter to read, and immediately your wish 
will be accomplished, provided you act with resolution."* 
The young man took the road he was commanded ; and, at 
night, standing in the open air, experienced the truth of the 
priest's assertion by everything which he saw; there was 
nothing but what was completed to a tittle. Among other 
passing figures, he beheld a woman, in meretricious garb, 
riding on a mule ; her hair, which was bound above in a 
golden fillet, floated unconfined on her shoulders; in her 
hand was a golden wand, with which she directed the pro- 
gress/of her beast; she was so thinly clad, as to be almost 
naked, and her gestures were wonderfully indecent. But 



234 wnxuM of kalmesburt. tB-"c.i3. 

what need of more ? At last come the chief, in appearance, 
who, from his chariot adorned with emeralds and pearls, fix- 
ing his ejes most sternly on the jonng man, demanded the 
cause of his presence. He made no reply, but stretching 
out his hand, gave him the letter. The demon, not daring 
to despise the well-known seal, read the epistle, and imme- 
diately, lifting up his hands to heaven, "Almighty Grod," 
said he, " in whose sight every transgression is as a noisome 
smell, how long wilt thou endure the crimes of the priest 
Palumbus ?" The devil then directly sent some of those 
about him to take the ring by force from Venus, who re- 
stored it at last, though with great reluctance. The young 
man thus obtaining his object, became possessed of his long 
desired pleasures without farther obstacle ; but Palumbus, 
on hearing of the devil's complaint to God concerning him, 
understood that the close of his days was predicted. In 
consequence, making a pitiable atonement by voluntarily 
cutting off aU his limbs, he confessed unheard-of crimes 
to the pope in the presence of the Boman people. 

At that time the body of PaUas, the son of Evander, of 
whom Yirgil speaks, was found entire at Rome, to the great 
astonishment of all, for having escaped corruption so many 
ages. Such, however, is the nature of bodies embalmed, 
that, when the flesh decays, the skin preserves the nerves, 
and the nerves the bones. The gash which Turnus had 
made in the middle of his breast measured four feet and a 
half. His epitaph was found to this effecl^ 

Pallas, Evander'B son, lies buried here 
In order due, transiix'd by TumuB* spear. 

Which epitaph I should not think made at the time, though 
Carmentis the mother of Evander is reported to have dis- 
covered the Boman letters, but that it was composed by 
Ennius, or some other ancient poet* There was a burning 
lamp at his head, constructed by magical art ; so that no

I am unable to say who was the author of this epigram, but it is not too 
hazardous to assert that it was not composed either bj Ennint or by any 
other ancient poet.

▼iolent blast, no dripping of water conld eztingaisli it. 
While many were lost in admiration at this, one person, as 
there are always some people expert in mischief, made an 
aperture beneath the flame with an iron style, which intro- 
ducing the air, the light vanished. The body, when set up 
against the wall, surpassed it in height, but some days after- 
wards, being drenched with the drip of the eves, it acknow- 
ledged the corruption common to mortals ; the skin and the 
nerves dissolving. 

At that time too, on the confines of Brittany and Nor- 
mandy, a prodigy was seen in one, or more properly speak- 
ing, in two women : there were two heads, four arms, and 
every other part two«-fold to the navel ; beneath, were two • 
legs, two feet, and all other parts single. While one was 
laughing, eating, or speaking, the other would cry, fast, or 
remain silent : though both mouths ate, yet the excrement 
was discharged by only one passage. At last, one dying, the 
other survived, and the living carried about the dead, for the 
space of three years, till she died also, through the fatigue of 
^e weight, and the stench of the dead carcass.* Many were 
of opinion, and some even have written, that these women 
represented England and Normandy, which, though sepa-» 
rated by position, are yet united under one master. What- . 
ever wealth these countries greedily absorb, flows into one 
common receptacle, which is either the covetousness of 
princes, or the ferocity of surrounding nations. England, 
yet vigorous, supports with her wealth Normandy now dead . ^ 
and almost decayed, until she herself perhaps shall fall 
through the violence of spoilers. Happy, if she shall ever 
again breathe that liberty, the mere shadow of which she 
has long pursued ! She now mourns, borne down with ca- 
lamity, and oppressed with exactions ; the causes of which 
misery I shall relate, after I have despatched some things 
pertaining to my subject. For since I have hitherto recorded 
the civil and military transactions of the kings of England, I 

* There seems no reason to doubt-the truth of this circumstance, since

that has occurred in the nineteenth century. Medical science, aided 
by comparative anatomy, has ascertained that the bodies of both man and 
the brute creation are susceptible of combinations — not usually occurring in 
the eouise of nature,— which in former times were thought impossible, and 
as such were universUly disbelieved.

may be allowed to expatiate somewhat on the sanctity of cer- 
tain of them ; and at the same time to conteII^>late what 
splendour of divine love beamed on this people, from the first 
dawning of their faith : since I believe joa can no where 
find the bodies of so many saints entire after death, t^ifjing 
the state of final incormption. I imagine this to have taken 
place by God's agency, in order that a nation, situated, as it 
were, almost out of the world, should more confidently em- 
brace the hope of a resurrection from the contemplation of 
the incormption of the saints. There are, altogether, five 
which I have known of, though the residents in many places 
boast of more ; Saint Etheldrida,* and Werburga, virginB ; 
king Edmund ; archbishop Elph^e ;f Cuthbert the ancient 
father : who with skin and flesh unwasted, and their joints 
flexile, appear to have a certain vital warmth about them, 
and to be merely sleeping. Who can enumerate all the other 
saints, of diflerent ranks and professions ? whose names and 
lives, singly to describe, I have neither intention nor leisure : 
yet oh that I might hereafter have leisure I But I will be 
silent, lest I should seem to promise more than I can per- 
form. In consequence, it is not necessary to mention any of 
the commonalty, but merely, not to go out of the path of my 
subject history, the male and female scions of the royal stock, 
most of them innocentiy murdered ; and who have been c<hi- 
secrated martyrs, not by human conjecture, but by divine 
acknowledgment. Hence may be known how littie indulg- 
ence they gave to the lust of pleasure, who inherited eter- 
nal glory by means of so easy a death. 

In the former book, my history dwelt for some time on the 
praises of the most holy Oswald, king and martyr ; amiMog 
whose other marks of sanctity, was this, which, according to 
some copies, is related in the £[istory of the Angles.^ In

filled with Nortliumbrian monks, a dreadfal malady broke 
out, and destroyed nombers ; the remainder endeavoured to 
a,Yett the pestilence by a fast of three days. On the second 
day of the fast, the blessed apostles Peter and Paul, appear- 
ing to a youth who was sick with the disorder, animated him 
by observing : " That he should not fear approaching death, 
as it would be a termination of his present illness, and an 
entrance into eternal life ; that no other person of that mon- 
astery would die of this disorder, because God had granted 
this to the merits of the noble king Oswald, who was that 
very day supplicating for his countrymen : for it was on this 
day that the king, murdered by the faithless, had in a mo- 
ment ascended to the heavenly tribunal : that they should 
search, therefore, in the scroll, in which the names of the 
dead were written, and if they found it so, they should put 
an end to the fast, give loose to security and joy, and sing 
solemn masses to God, and to the holy king." This vision 
being quickly followed by the death of the boy, and the anni- 
versary of the martyr being found in the martyrology, and at 
the same time the cessation of the disorder being attested by 
the whole province, the name of Oswald was from that period 
inserted among the martyrs, wiiich before, on account of his 
recent death, had only been admitted into the list of the faith- 
fuL Deservedly, I say, then, deservedly is he to be cele- 
brated, whose glory the divine approbation so signally mani- 
fested, as to order hun to be dignified with masses, in a 
manner, as I think, not usual among men. The undoubted 
▼eracity of the historian precludes the possibility of sup- 
posing this matter to be false ; as does also the blessed bishop 
Acca,* who was the friend of the author. 

Egbert, king of Kent, the son of Erconbert, whom I have 
mentioned before, had some very near relations, descended 
from the royal line ; their names were Ethelredf and Ethel- 
bert, the sons of Ermenred his uncle. Apprehensive that 
they might grow up with notions of succeeding to the king- 
dom, and fearful for his safety, he kept them about him for 
some time, with very homely entertainment : and, at last, 
glrudging them his regards, he removed them from Ids court.

Soon after, when thej had been secretly despatched by one 
of his servants named Thanre, which signifies Thunder, he 
buried them under heaps of rubbish, thinking that a murder 
perpetrated in privacy would escape detection. The eye of 
God however, which no secrets of the heart can deceive, 
brought the innocents to light, vouchsafing many cures upon 
the spot ; until the neighbours, being roused, dug up the 
unsightly heaps of turf and rubbish cast upon their bodies^ 
and forming a trench after the manner of a sepulchre, they 
erected a small church over it There they remained till the 
time of king Edgar, when they were taken up by St. Oswald, 
archbishop* of Worcester, and conveyed to the monastery of 
Ramsey ; from which period, granting the petitions of the 
suppliant, they have manifested themselves by many miracles. 

Offa king of the Mercians murdered many persons of con- 
sequence for the security, as he supposed, of his kingdom, 
without any distinction of friend or foe ; among these was 
king Ethelbert ;f thereby being guilty of an atrocious out- 
rage against the suitor of his daughter. His unmerited 
death, however, is thought to have been amply avenged by 
the short reign of Ofia's son. Indeed God signalised his 
sanctity by such evident tokens, that at this very day the 
episcopal church of Hereford is consecrated to his name. 
Nor should any thing appear idle or irrelevant, which our 
pious and religious ancestors have either tolerated by their 
silence, or confirmed by their authority. 

What shall my pen here trace worthy of St Kenelm, a 
youth of tender age ? Kenulf, king of the Mercians, his 
father, had consigned him, when seven years old, to his sister 
Quendrida, for the purpose of education. But she, falsely 
entertaining hopes of the kingdom for herself, gave her little 
brother in charge to a servant of her household, with an 
order to despatch him. Taking out the innocent, under pre- 
tence of hunting for his amusement or recreation, he mur« 
dered and hid him in a thicket. But strange to tell, the 
crime which had been so secretly committed in England, 
.gained publicity in Rome, by God's agency : for a dove, 
from heaven, bore a parchment scroll to the altar of St. 
Peter, containing an exact account both of his death and

place of burial. As this was written in the English language 
it was vainly attempted to be read hj the Bomans and men 
of other nations who were present. Fortunately, however, 
and opportunely, an Englishman was at hand, who translated 
the writing to the Roman people, into Latin, and gave occa- 
sion to the pope to write a letter to the kings of England, 
acquainting them with the martyrdom of their countryman. 
In consequence of this the body of the innocent was taken 
up in presence of a numerous assembly, and removed to 
Winchcomb. The murderous woman was so indignant at the 
vocal chaunt of the priests and loud applause of the laity, 
that she thrust out her head from the window of the chamber 
where she was standing, and, by chance, having in her hands 
a psalter, she came in course of reading to the psalm '' O 
God my praise," which, for I know not what charm, readii^ 
backwards, she endeavoured to drown the joy of the choris- 
ters. At that moment, her eyes, torn by divine vengeance 
from their hollow sockets, scattered blood upon the verse 
which runs, " This is the work of them who defame me to 
the Lord, and who speak evil against my soul." The marks 
of her blood are still extant, proving the cruelty of the 
woman, and the vengeance of God. The body of the little 
saint is very generally adored, and there is hardly any place 
in England more venerated, or where greater nmnbers of 
persons attend at the festival ; and this arising from the long- 
continued belief of his sanctity, and the constant exhibition 
of miracles. 

Nor shall my history be wanting in thy praise, Wistan,* \ 
blessed youth, son of Wimund, son of Withlaf king of the 
Mercians, and of Elfleda, daughter of Ceolwulf, who was the 
unde of Kenelm ; I will not, I say, pass thee over in silence, 
whom Berfert thy relation so atrociously murdered. And 
let posterity know, if they deem this history worthy of perusal, 
that there was nothing earthly more praiseworthy than your 
disposition ; at which a deadly assassin becoming irritated,

revealed the wickedness of the deep cavern, and brought to 
view the crime of the murderer. In consequence, Wistan's 
venerable remains were taken up, and hj the care of his rela-

thee. 

Bede has related many anecdotes of the sanctity of the 
kings of the East Saxons, and East Angles, whose genealogy 
I have in the first book of this work traced briefly ; because 
I could no where find a complete history of the kings. I 
shall however, dilate somewhat on St. Edmund, who held 
dominion in East Anglia, and to whom the time of Bede did 
not extend. This province, on the south and east, is sur- 
rounded by the ocean ; on the north, by deep lakes, and 
stagnant pools, which, stretching out a vast distance ia 
length, with a breadth of two or three miles, afford abund- 
,ance of fish for the use of the inhabitants ; on the west it 
is continuous with the rest of the island, but defended by 
the earth's being thrown up in the form of a rampart.f The 
soil is admirable for pasture, and for hunting ; it is full of 
monasteries, and large bodies of monks are settled on the 
' islands of these stagnant waters ; the people are a merry, 
- pleasant, jovial race, though apt to carry their jokes to ex- 
cess. Here, then, reigned Edmund ; a man devoted to Grod, 
ennobled by his descent from ancient kings, and though he 
presided over the province in peace for several years, yet 
never through the eff<aEDina£y of the times did he relax his 
virtue. Hingwar and Hubba, two leaders of the Danes/came 
over to depopulate the provinces) of the Northumbrian^ and 
East Angles. The former of tnese seized the unresisting 
king, who had cast away his arms and was lying on the 
ground in prayer, and, after the infliction of tortures,^ be- 
headed him. On the death of this saintly man, the purity of 
his past life was evidenced by unheard-of miracles. The 
Danes had cast away the head, when severed from the body

by the craelty of the execntioners, and it had been Mdden in 
a thicket. While his subjects, who had tracked the footsteps 
of the enemy as they departed, were seeking it, intending to 
solemnize, with due honour the funeral rites of their king, 
they were struck with the pleasing intervention of Grod : for 
the lifi^ess head uttered a voice, inviting all who were in 
search of it to approach. A wolf, a beast accnstomed to 
prey upon dead carcasses, was holding it in its paws, and 
guarding it untouched ; which animal also, after the manner 
of a tame creature, gently followed the bearers to the tomb, 
and neither did nor received any injury. The sacred 
body was then, for a time, committed to the earth ; turf 
was placed over it, and a wooden chapel, of trifling cost, 
erected. The negligent natives, however, were soon made 
sensible of the virtue of the martyr, which excited their 
listless minds to reverence him, by the miracles which he 
performed. And though perhaps the first proof of his power 
may appear weak and trivial, yet nevertheless I shall subjoin 
it. He bound, with invisible bands, some thieves who had 
endeavoured to break into the church by night : this was 
done in the very attempt ; a pleasant spectacle enough, to 
see the plunder hold fast the thief, so that he could neither 
desist f]X>m the enterprise, nor complete the design. In con- 
sequence, Theodred bishop of London, who lies at St. Paul's, 
removed the lasting disgrace of so mean a structure, by build- 
ing a nobler edifice over those sacred limbs, which evidenced 
the glory of his unspotted soul, by surprising soundness, and 
a kind of milky whiteness. The head, which was formerly 
divided from the neck, is again united to the rest of the body 
showing only the sign of martyrdom by a purple seam. One 
drcomstance indeed surpasses human miracles, which is> that 
the hair and nails of the dead man continue to grow : these, 
Oswen, a holy woman, used yearly to dip and cut, that they 
might be objects of veneration to posterity. Truly this was 
a holy temerity, for a woman to contemplate and handle 
limbs superior to the whole of this world. Not so Leofstan, 
a youth of bold and untamed insolence, who, with many im- 
pertinent threats, commanded the body of the martyr to be 
shown to him ; for he was desirous, as he said, of settling 
the uncertainty of report by the testimony of his own eye- 
sight. He paid dearly, however, for his audacious experi-

ment ; for he became insane, and shortly after, died, swarming 
with vermin. He felt indeed that Edmund was now capable 
of doing, what he before used to do ; that is, 

** To Bpan the suppliant, but confound the proud," 

by which means he so completely engaged the inhabitants of 
aU Britain to him, that every person looked upon himself as 
particularly happy, in contributing either money or gifts to 
St. Edmund's monastery : even kings themselves, who rule 
others, used to boast of being his servants, and sent him their 
royal crown ; redeeming it, if they wished to use it, at a 
great price. The exactors of taxes also, who, in other places, 
gave loose to injustice, were there suppliant, and ceased their 
cavilling at St. Edmund's boundary,* admonished thereto by 
the punishment of others who had pres^med to overpass it 

My commendations shall also glance at the names of some 
maidens of the royal race, though I must claim indulgence 
for being brief upon the subject, not through fastidiousness, 
but because I am unacquainted with their miracles. Anna 
king of the East Angles had three daughters, Etheldrida, 
Ethelberga, and Sexberga. Etheldrida, though married to 
two husbands, yet by means of saintly continence, as Bede 
relates, without any diminution of modesty, without a single 
lustful inclination, triumphantly displayed to heaven the 
pahn of perpetual virginity. Ethelberga, first a nun, and 
afterwards abbess, in a monastery in France called Brigis,t 
was celebrated for unblemished chastity ; and it is well wor- 
thy of remark, that as both sisters had subdued the lusts of 
the flesh while living, so, when dead, their bodies remained 
uncorrupt, the one in England, and the other in France ; in- 
somuch, that their sanctity, which is abundantly resplendent, 
may suffice 

** To cast its ladianoe oyer both the poles.** 

Sexberga was married to Erconbert king of Kent, and, 
after his death, took the veil in the same monastery w^bero 
her sister Etheldrida was proclaimed a saint She had two 
daughters by king Erconbert, Earcongota and Ermenhilda.

Of Ercongota, such as wish for information will, find it in 
Bede ;* Ermenhilda married Wulfhere, king of the Mer- 
cians, and had a daughter, Werburga, a most holy virgin. 
Both are saints : the mother, that is to say, St £rmenhilda, 
rests at Ely, where she was abbess after her mother, Sez- 
berga ; and the daughter lies at Chester, in the monastery of 
that city, which Hugo earl of Chester, ejecting a few canons 
who resided there in a mean and irregular manner, has re- 
cently erected* The praises and miracles of both these 
women, and particuhurly of the younger, are there ex- 
tolled and held in veneration ; and though they are fa- 
vourable to all petitions without delay, yet are they more 
especially kind and assistant to the supplications of women 
and youths. 

Merewald the brother of Wulfhere, by Ermenburga, the 
daughter of Ermenred brother of Erconbert king of Eent^ 
had two daughters : Mildritha and Milburga. Mildrith% 
dedicating herself to celibacy, ended her days in the Isle of 
Thanet in Kent, which king Egbert had given to her mo- 
ther, to atone for the murder of her brothers, Ethelred and 
£thelbert.f In after times, being transferred to St. Augus- 
tine's monastery at Canterbury, she is there honoured by the 
marked attention of the monks, and celebrated equally for 
her kindness and affability to all, as her name^ implies. And 
although almost every comer of that monastery is filled with 
the bodies of saints of great name and merit, any one of 
which would he of itself sufficient to irradiate all England, 
yet no one is there more revered, more loved, or more grate- 
fully remembered ; and she, turning a deaf ear to none who 
love her, is present to them in the salvation of their souls. 

Biilburga reposes at Wenlock :§ formerly well known to the 
neighbouring inhabitants ; but for some time after the arri- 
val of the Normans, through ignorance of the place of her 
burial, she was neglected. Lately, however, a convent of

C/lugniac monks being established thercy while a new church 
was erecting, a certain boy running violently along the pave- 
ment, broke into the hollow of the vanity and discovered the 
body of the virgin ; when a balsamic odour pervading the 
whole church, she was taken up, and performed so many 
miracles, that the people flocked thither in great multitudes. 
Large spreading plains could hardly contain the troops of 
pilgrims, while rich and poor came side by side, one common 
ftith impelling all. Nor did the event deceive their expect- 
ations : for no one departed, without either a perfect cure, 
or considerable abatement of his malady, and some were even 
healed of the king's evil, by the merits of this virgin, when 
medical assistance was unavailing. 

Edward the Elder, of whom I have before spoken at large, 
had by his wife Edgiva, several daughters. Among these 
was Eadburga, who, when she was scarcely three years old, 
gave a singular indication of her future sanctity. Her fa^ 
ther was inclined to try whether the little girl was inclined 
to God, or to the world, and had placed in a chamber the 
symbols of different professions ; on one side a chalice, and 
the gospels ; on the other, bracelets and necklaces. Hither 
the child was brought in the arms of her indulgent attendant, 
and, sitting on her father^s knee, was desired to choose which 
she pleased. Rejecting the earthly ornaments with stem 
regard, she instantly fdl prostrate before the chalice and the 
gospels, and worshipped them with infant adoration. The 
company present exclaimed aloud, and fondly hailed the 
prospect of the child's future sanctity ; her father embraced 
the infant in a manner still more endearing. " Go," said he, 
" whither the Divinity calls thee ; follow with prosperous 
steps the spouse whom thou hast chosen, and truly blessed 
shsJl my wife and myself be, if we are surpassed in hoHneas 
by our daughter." When clothed in the garb of a nun, she 
gained the affection of all her female companions, in the city 
of Winchester, by the marked attention she paid them. Nor 
did the greatness of her birth elevate her ; as she esteemed 
it noble to stoop to the service of Christ • Her sanctitj in- 
creased with her years, her humility kept pace with her 
growth ; so that she used secretly to steal away the socks of 
/ the several nuns at night, and, carefully washing and anoint- 
^ ing them, ky them again upon thdr beds. Wherefore,

though Grod fflgnaluEed her, while living, foj many miracles, 
yet I more particularlj bring forward this circumstance, to 
show that charity began all her works, and humility com- 
pleted them : and finally, many miracles in her life-time, and 
since her death, confirm the devotion of her heart and the 
incorruptness of her body, which the attendants at her 
churches at Winchester and Parshore relate to such as are 
cmacqnainted with them. 

St. Editha, the daughter of king Edgar, ennobles, with 
her relics, the monastery of Wilton, where she was buried, 
and cherishes that place with her regard, where, trained from 
her infancy in the school of the Lord, she gained his favour 
by unsullied virginity, and constant watchings : repressing 
the pride of her high birth by her humility. I have heard 
one circumstance of her, from persons of elder days, wliich 
greatly staggered the opinions of men : for she led them into 
false conclusions from the splendour of her costly dress ; 
being always habited in richer garb than the sanctity of her 
profession seemed to require. On this account, being openly 
rebuked by St. Ethelwold, she is reported to have answered 
with equal point and wit, that the judgment of God was 
true and irrefragable, while that of man, alone, was fallible ; 
for pride might exist even under the garb of wretchedness ; ' 
wherefore, " I think," said she, ** that a mind may be as pure « 
beneath these vestments, as under your tattered furs." The ^ 
bishop was deeply struck by this speech ; admitting its truth 
by his silence, and blushing with pleasure that he had been 
chastised by the sparkling repartee of the lady, he held his 
peace. St. Dunstan had observed her, at the consecration of 
the church of St. Denys, which she had built out of affection 
to that martyr, firequently stretching out her right thumb, 
and making the sign of the cross upon her forehead ; and 
being extremely delighted at it, " May this finger," he ex- 
claimed, '^ never see corruption:" and immediately, while! 
celebrating mass, he burst into such a flood of tears, that he 
alarmed with his faltering voice an assistant standing near 
him ; who inqtdring the reason of it, *' Soon," said he, ^* shall 
this blooming rose wither ; soon shall this beloved bird take 
its flight to God, after the expiration of six weeks from this 
time." The truth of the prelate's prophecy was very shortly 
folfilied ; for on the appointed day, this noble^ firmly-minded 



246 WOAAASl OF KALHESBOBT. [b. n. c. ISL 

ladj, expired in her jprimey at the age of twentj-three jears^ 
Soon afler^lhe same saint saw, in a dream, St. Denjs kindly 
taking the virgin bj the hand, and strictlj enjoining, hj 
divine command, that she should be hooonred bj her aenrants 
on earth, in the same manner as she was venerated by her 
spouse and master in heaven. Miracles multiplying at her 
tomb, it was ordered, that her virgin body should be taken 
up, and exalted in a shrine ; when the whole of it was found 
resolved into dust, except the finger, with the abdomen and 
parts adjacent. Li consequence of which, some debate ari- 
sing, the virgin herself appeared, in a dream, to one of those 
who had seen her remains, saying, '* It was no wonder, if the 
other parts of the body had decayed, since it was customary 
for dead bodies to moulder to their native dust, and she, per* 
haps, as a girl, had sinned with those memb^ ; but it was 
highly just, that the abdomen should see no corruption which 
had never felt the sting of lust ; as she had been entirely free 
from gluttony or cam^ copulation." 

Truly both these virgins support their respective monas- 
teries by their merits ; each of them being filled with large 
assemblies of nuns, who answer obediently to the call of their 

S "distresses and patronesses, inviting them to virtue. Happy 
e man, who becomes partaker of those virgin orisons whidli 
e Lord Jesus favours with kind regard. For, as I have 
remarked of the nuns oi Shaftesbury, all virtues have hmg 
since quitted the earth, and retired to heaven ; or, if any 
where, (but this I must say with the permission of holy 
men,) are to be found only in the hearts of nuns ; and surely 
' those women are highly to be praised, who, regardless of the 
weakness of theiir^sex, vie with each other in the preservation 
of their continence, and by such means ascend, triumphant^ 
to heaven. 

y I think it of importance to have been acquainted with many 
of the royal family of either sex ; as it may be gathered 
from thence that king Edward, concerning whom I was 
speaking before I digressed, by no means degenerated from 
the virtues or hTs' ancestors. In fact he was famed both for 
miracles, and for the spirit of prophecy, as I shall hereafter 
relate. In the exaction of taxes he was sparing, and he 
abominated the insolence of collectors: in eating and 
drinking he was free finnathe voluptuousness which his 



iJiLlOSS.! ORIGIN OF THE ROTAL TOOCH. 247 

stete allowed : on tlie more solemn festivals, though dressed 
in robes interwoven with gold, which the queen had most 
^^CTididlj embroid ered , jet still he Had^such^rhearance, 
as to be snfficientlj majestic, without being haughty ; con- 
sidering in snch matters, rather the bounty of God, than the 
pomp of the world. There was one earthlj enjoyment in 
which he chiefly delighted ; which was, hunting with fleet 
bonndsy whose opening in the woods he used with pleasure 
to encourage : and agaih, with the pouncing of birds, whose 
nature it is to prey on their kindred species. In these 
exercises, after hearing divine service in the morning, he 
employed himself whole days. In other respects he was a 
man l^ choice devoted to God, and lived the life of an angel 
in the administration of his kingdom. To the poor and to 
the stranger, more especially foreigners and men of religious 
orders, he was kind in invitation, muniflcent in his presents, 
and constantly exciting the monks of his own country to 
imitate their holiness. He was of a becoming stature ; his 
beard and hair milk-white ; his countenance florid ; fair 
throughout his whole person ; and his form of admirable 
proportion. 

The happiness of his times had been revealed in a dream 
to Brithsdn. bishop jof . Wilton, who had made it public 
m the time of Cajiute, when, at Glastonbury, he was 
once intent on heavenly watchings, and the thought of the 
near extinction of the royal race of the Angles, which 
frequently, distressed him, came into his mind, sleep stole 
upon him thus meditating ; when behold I he was rapt on 
high, and saw Peter, the chief of the apostles, consecrating 
Edwurd, who at that time was an exile in Normandy, king ; 
his chaste life too was pointed out, and the exact period 
of his reign, twepty-four yei^ determined ; and, when 
inquiring about his posterity, it was answered, "The 
kingdom of the English belongs to God ; after you he will 
provide a king according to his pleasure." 

But now to speak of his miracles. A young woman had 
married a husband of her own age, but having no issue by 
the union, the humours collecting abundantly about her neck, 
she had contracted a sore disorder ; the glands swelling 
in a dreadful manner. Admonished in a dream to have the 
part affected washed by the king, she entered the palace, and 



\

the king himself fulfilled this labour of love, by rubbing tha 
woman's neck with his fingers dipped in water. Jojous 
health followed his healing hand : Uie lurid flikin opened, so 
that worms flowed out with the purulent matter, and the 
tumour subsided. But as the orifice of the ulcers was large 
and unsightlj, he commanded her to be supported at the 
royal expense tUl she should be perfectly cured. However, 
before a week was expired, a fair, new skin returned, and 
hid the scars so completely, that nothing ot the original 
wound could be cGsooTered : and within a year becoming the 
mother of twins, she increased the admiration of Edward's 
holiness. Those who knew him more intimately, aflirm that 
he often cured this complaint in Normandy : whence appears 
how false is their notion, who in our times assert, that the 
cure of this disease does not proceed from personal sanctity, 
but from hereditary virtue in the royal line. 

A certain man, blind from some unknown mischance, had 
persisted in asserting about the palace^ that he should be 
cured, if he could touch his eyes with the water in which 
the king's hands had been washed. This was frequently 
related to Edward, who derided it, and looked angrily on the 
persons who mentioned it ; confessing himsdf a sinner, and 
that the works of holy men did not belong to him. But the 
servants, thinking this a matter not to be n^lected, tried the 
experiment when he was ignorant of it, and was praying in 
church. The instant the blind man was washed with the 
water, the long-enduring darkness fled from his eyes, and 
they were filled with joyful light ; and the king, inquiring 
the cause of the grateful clamour of the by-standers, was 
informed of the fact. IVesently afterwards, when, by 
thrusting his fingers towards the eyes of the man he had 
cured, and perceiving him draw back his head to avoid 
them, he had made proof of his sight, he, with uplifted hands^ 
returned thanks to Grod. In the same way he cured a blind 
man at Lincoln, who survived him many years, a prodT of 
the royal miracle. 

That you may know the perfect virtue of this prince, in 
the power of healing more especially, I shall add something 
which will excite your wonder. Wulwin, sumamed Spille- 
com, the^ son of Wulmar of Nutgareshale, was one day 
cuttmg timber in the wood of BmeQe^ and indulging in a

long sleep after his labour, he lost his sight for seventeen 
years, from the blood, as I imagine, stagnating about his 
ejes : at the end of this time, he was admonished in a 
dream to go round to eighty-seven churches, and earnestly 
entreat a cure of his blindness from the saints. At last he 
came to the king's court, where he remained for a long time, 
in vain, in opposition to the attendants, at the vestibule of 
his chamber. He still continued importunate, however, 
without being deterred, till at last, after much difficulty, he 
was admittea by order of the king. When he had heard the 
dream, he mildly answered, " By my lady St. Mary, I shall 
be truly grateful, if Gk)d, through my means, shall choose to 
take pity upon a wretched creature." Li consequence^ 
though he had no confidence in himself, with respect to 
miracles, yet, at the instigation of his servants, he placed his 
hand, dipped in water, on the blind man. In a moment the 
blood dripped plentifully &om his eyes, and the man, restored 
to sight, excUomed with rapture, *' I see you, O king ! I see 
you, O king ! " In this recovered state, he had charge of 
the royal palace at Windsor, for there the cure had been 
performed, for a long time ; surviving his restorer several 
years. On the same day, from the same water, three blind 
men, and a man with one eye, who were supported on the 
royal arms, received a cure ; the servants administering the 
heading water with perfect confidence. 

On Easter-day, he was sitting at table at Westminster, 
with the crown on his head, and surrounded by a crowd of 
nobles. While the rest were greedily eating, and making up 
for the long fast of Lent by the newly provided viands, he, 
with mind abstracted from earthly things, was absorbed in 
the contemplation of some divine matter, when presently he 
excited the attention of the guests by bursting into profuse 
laughter : and as none presumed to inquire into the cause of his 
joy, he remained silent as before, till satiety had put an end 
to the banquet. After the tables were removed, and as he 
was unrobing in his chamber, three persons of rank followed 
him ; of these earl Harold was one, the second was an abbat, 
and the third a bishop, who presuming on their intimacy 
asked the cause of his laughter, observing, that it seemed just 
matter of astonishment to see him, in such perfect tranquillity 
both of time and occupation, burst into a vulgar laugh, while 



250 WILLIAM OF KALMBSBUBT. [b.ie.c1S. 

all others were silent. ** I saw something wonderful," said 
he^ ^'and therefore I did not laugh without a cauBe." At 
this, as is the custom of mankind, thej began to inquire and 
search into the matter more earnestij, entreating that he 
would condescend to disclose it to them. After much reluct- 
ance^ he yielded to their persevering solicitations, and re- 
lated the following wonderful circumstance, saying, that the 
^^^ / Seven Sleepers in mount Ccelius had now lain for two hun- 

\l I dred years on their right side, but that, at the very hour of 
\his laughter, they turned upon their left; that they would 
Continue to lie in this manner for seventy-four years, which 
would be a dreadful omen to wretched mortals. For every 
thing would come to pass, in these seventy-four years, which 
the Lord had foretold to his disciples concerning the end of 
the world ; nation would rise against nation, and kingdom 
against kingdom; earthquakes would be in divers places; 
pestilence and famine, terrors from heaven and great signs ; 
changes in kingdoms ; wars of the gentiles against the Chris- 
tians, and also victories of the Christians over the pagans. 
Relating these matters to his wondering audience, he de- 
scanted on the passion of these sleepers, and the maka of 
their bodies, though totally unnoticed in history, as readily 
as though he had lived in daily intercourse with them. Go 
hearing this the earl sent a knight ; the bishop a clergyman ; 
and the abbat a monk, to Maniches the Constantinopolitan 
emperor, to investigate the truth of his declaration ; adding 
letters and presents £rom the king. After being kindly 
entertained, Maniches sent them to the bishop of Ephesns, 
giving them at the same time what is called a holy letter, 
that the martyr-relics of the Seven Sleepers should be shown 
to the delegates of the king of England.* It fell out that 

* The Seven Sleepen were inhabitants of Ephesus ; six were penons of 
some consequence, the seventh their servant. During the Decian persecu- 
tion thej retired to a cave, whence they despatched their attendant occasion- 
ally to purchase food for them. Decius, hearing this, ordered the mouth of the 
cave to be stopped up while the fugitives woe deeping. After a lapse of some 
hundred years, a part of the masonry at the mouth of the cave falling, the 
light flowing in awakened them. Thinking they had enjoyed a good night's 
rest, they despatched their servant to buy provision. He finds all appear 
Strang in Ephesus, and a whimsical dialogue takes place, the citiieni 
accusing him of having found hidden treasure, he persisting that be offeied 
^e current coin of the empire. At length the attention of the emperor

the presage of king Edward was proved by all tlie Greeks, 
who could swear they had heard from their fathers that the 
men were lying on their right side ; but after the entrance of 
the English into the vault, they published the truth of the 
foreign prophecy to their countrymen. Nor was it long be* 
fore the predicted evils came to pass ; for the Hagarens, and 
Arabsy and Turks, nations averse to Christ, making havoc of 
the Christians, overran Syria, and Lycia, and Asia Minor 
altogether, devastating many cities too of Asia Major, among 
which was Ephesus, and even Jerusalem itself. At the same 
time, on the death of Maniches emperor of Constantinople, 
Diogenes, and Michaelius, and Bucinadus, and Alexius, in 
turn hurled each other headlong from the throne ; the last of 
whom, continuing till our time, left for heir his son John more 
noted for cunning and deceit than worth. He contrived 
many hurtful plots against the pilgrims on their sacred jour- 
ney; but venerating the fidelity of the English, he showed 
them every civility, and transmitted his regard for them to 
his son.* In the next seven years were three popes, Victor, 
Stephen, Nicholas,! who diminished the vigour of the papacy 
by their successive deaths. Almost immediately afterwards too 
died Henry, the pious emperor of the Romans, and had for suc- 
cessor Henry his son, who brought many calamities on the <dty

thee long since ; bat I now behold thee much more terrible, 
threatening to hurl destruction on this country." He was a 
man of good learning for those times, of mature age, and in his 
early youth had hi^arded an attempt of singular temerity. 
He had by some contrivance fastened wings to his hands and 
feet, in order that, looking upon the fable as true, he might 
fly like Dsedalus, and collecting the air on the summit of a 
tower, had flown for more than the distance of a furlong ; 
but, agitated by the violence of the wind and the current of 
air, as well as by the consciousness of his rash attempt, he 
fell and broke his legs, and was lame ever after. He used 
to relate as the cause of his failure, his forgetting to provide 
himself a talL 

Another prophecy similar to this, Edward uttered when 
dying, which I shall here antidpate. When he had lain two 
days speechless, on the third, sadly and deeply sighing as he 
awoke from his torpor, ^* Almighty Gkid," said he^ *^ as this 
shall be a real vision, or a vain illusion, which I have seen, 
grant me the power of explaining it, or not, to the by- 
standers." Soon after speaking fluently, " I saw just now,* 
continued he, '* two monks near me, whom formerly, when 
a youth in Normandy, I knew both to have lived in a most 
religious manner, and to have died like perfect Christians. 
These men, announcing themselves as the messengers of God, 
spake to the following effect : ' Since the chiefs of England, 
thedukes, bishops, and abbats, are not the ministers of Grod, 
but of the devil, God, after your death, has delivered this 
kingdom for a year and a day, into the hand of the enemy, 
and devils shall wander over all the land.' And when I said 
that I would show these things to my people ; and promised 
that they should liberate themselves by repentance, after the 
old example of the Ninevites ; * Neither of these,' said they, 
* shall take place ; for they will not repent, nor will God 
have mercy on them.' When then, said I, may cessation 
&om such great calamities be hoped for ? They replied, 
' Whenever a green tree shall be cut through the middle, and 
the part cut off, being carried the space of three acres from 
the trunk, shall, without any assistance, become again united 
to its stem, bud out with flowers, and stretch forth its fruit, 
as before, from the sap again uniting ; tlien may a cessation 
of such evils be at last expected' "

Though others were apprehensive of the truth of this 
prediction, yet Stigand, at that time archbishop, received 
it with laughter ; saying, that the old man doted through 
disease. We, however, find the truth of the presage experi- 
mentally ; for England is become the residence of foreigners, 
and the property of strangers : at the present time, there is 
no EngHshman, either, e arl^ b ishop, or abbat ; strangers all, 
they prey upon the riches and vitals of England ; nor is 
there any hope of a termination to this misery. The cause 
of which evi^ as I have long since promised, it is now high 
time that my .narrative should endeavour briefly to disclose. 

King Edward declining into years, as he had no children 
hiwiBftlf^ and saw the sons of Godwin growing in power, .de- 
spatched messengers to the king of Hungary, to send over 
Edward, the son of his brother Edmund, with aU his family : 
intending, as he declared, that either he, or his sons, should 
succeed to the hereditary kingdom of England, and that his 
own want of issue should be supplied by that of his kindred. 
Edward came in consequence, but died almost immediately 
at St. Paul's* in London : he was neither valiant, nor a man 
of abilities. He left three surviving children ; that is to 
say, Edgar, who, after the death of Harold, was by some 
elected king ; and who, after many revolutions of fortune, is 
now living wholly retired in the country, in extreme old age : 
Christina, who grew old at Bomsey in the habit of a nun : 
Margaret, whom Malcolm king of the Scots espoused. Bless- 
ed with a numerous offspring, her sons were Edgar, and 
Alexander, who reigned in Scotland after their father in due 
succession : for the eldest, Edward, had fallen in battle with 
his father ; the youngest, David, noted for his meekness and 
discretion, is at present king of Scotland. Her daughters 
were, Matilda, whom in our time king Henry has married, 
and Maria, whom Eustace the younger, earl of Boulogne, 
espoused. The king, in tonsequence of the death of his rela- 
tion, losing his first hope of support, gave the succession oi\ ' 
England to William earl of Normandy.')' He was well/ 
worthy of such a gift, being a young man of superior mind, 
who had raised himself to the highest eminence by his un-

wearied exertion : moreover, lie was his nearest relation bj 
oonsanguinitj, as lie was the son of Robert, the son of Richard 
the second, whom we have repeatedly mentioned as the 
brother of Emma, Edward's mother. Some affirm that 
Harold himself was sent into Normandj hj the king for this 
purpose : others, who knew Harold's more secret intentions, 
say, that being driven thither against his will, hj the violence 
of the wind, he imagined this device, in order to extricate 
himself. This, as it appears nearest the truth, I shall relate. 
Harold being at his country-seat at Boseham,* went for 
recreation on board a fishing boat^ and, for the purpose of 
prolonging his sport, put out to sea ; when a sudden tempest 
arising, he was driven with his companions on the coast of 
Pontlueu^ The people of that district, as was their native 
custom, immediately assembled from all quarters ; and 
Harold's company, unarmed and few in number, were, as it 
easily might be, quickly overpowered by an armed multitude, 
and bound hand and foot Harold, craftily meditating a 
remedy for this mischance, sent a person, whom he had 
allured by very great promises, to William, to say, that he 
had been sent into Normandy by the king, for the purpose 
of expressly confirming, in person, the message which had 
been imperfectly delivered by people of less authority ; but 
that he was detained in fetters by Guy earl of Ponthieu, and 
could not execute his embassy : that it was the barbarous 
and inveterate custom of the country, that such as had escaped 
destruction at sea, should meet with perils on shore : that it 
well became a man of his dignity, not to let this paas un- 
punished : that to suffer those to be laden with chains, who 
appealed to his protection, detracted somewhat from his own 
greatness : and that if his captivity must be terminated by 
money, he would gladly give it to earl William, but not to 
the contemptible Guy. By these means, Harold was liberated 
at William's command, and conducted to Normandy by Guy 
in person. The earl entertained him with much respect, 
both in banqueting and in vesture, according to the custom 
of his country ; and the better to learn his disposition, and 
at the same time to try his courage, took him with him in an 
expedition he at that time led against Brittany. There, 
Harold^ well proved both in ability and courage, won the

beart of the Norman ; and, still more to ingratiate himself, 
he of his own accord, confirmed to him bj oath the castle ofi 
Dover, which was under his jurisdiction, and the kingdom^ 
of England, ailer the death of Edward. Wherefore, he was 
honoured both by having his daughter, then a child, be^ 
trothed to him, and bj the confirmation of his ample patri- 
monj, and was received into the strictest intlmacj. Not 
long afler his return home, the king was crowned* at Lon- 
don on Christmas-daj, and being there seized with the 
disorder of which he was sensible he should die, he com- 
manded the church of Westminster to be dedicated on Inno* 
cents-daj.l Thus, full of years and of glory, he surren- 
dered his pure spirit to heaven, and was buried on the day 
of the Epiphany, in the said church, which he, first in Eng- 
land, had erected after that kind of style which, now, almost 
all attempt to rival at enormous expense. The race of the \ 
West Saxons, which had reigned in Britain five hundred \ 
and seventy-one years, from the time of Cerdic, and two 
hundred and sixty-one from Egbert, in him ceased altogether 
to rule. For while the grief for the king's death was yet 
&esh, Harold, on the very day of the Epiphany, seized the 
diadem, and extorted from the nobles their consent ; though 
the English say, that it was granted him by the king : but I 
conceive it alleged, more through regard to Harold, than 
through sound judgment, that Edward should transfer his 
inheritance to a man of whose power he had always been 
jealous. Still, not to conceal the truth, Harold would have 
governed the kingdom with prudence and with courage, in 
the character he had assumed, had he undertaken it lawfully. 
Indeed, during Edward's lifetime, he had quelled, by lus 
valour, whatever wars were excited against hun ; wishing to 
signalize himself with his countrymen, and looking forward

vals of Easter, Whitsuntide, and Chiistmas : it being plackl on his head in 
due form by the archbishop.

Allied of Hievaulx, in his Life of Edward, states that the church had been 
commenced some years before, in performance of a tow the king had made 
to 90 to Rome ; but being dissuaded firom it, he sent to the pope to obtain 
his dispensation irom that journey ; the pope granted it, on condition that 
Edward should, with the money he would have spent in that voyage, build 
a monasteiy in honour of St. Peter." — Haiudy.

with anxious hope to the crown. He first yanquished 
Grifiin king of the Welsh, as I hare before related, in battle ; 
and, afterwards, when he was again making formidable 
efforts to recoTer his power, deprived him of his head ; ap- 
pointing as his successors, two of his own adherents, that is, 
the brothers of this Griffin, Bl^ent and Rivallo,.who had 
obtained his favour bj their submission. The same year 
Tosty arrived on the Humber, from Flanders, with a fleet of 
sixty ships, and infested with piratical depredations those 
parts which were adjacent to the mouth of the river ; but 
being quickly driven from the province by the joint force of 
the brothers, Edwin and Morcar, he set sail towards Scot- 
land ; where meeting with Q^ld.JHurfager king of Nor- 
way, then meditating an attack on Englahd with three hun- 
dred ships, he put lumself under his command. Both, then, 
with united forces, liud waste the countiy beyond the Hum- 
ber ; and falling on the brothers, reposing after their recent 
victory and suspecting no attack of the kind, they first 
routed, and then shut them up in York. Harold, on hear- 
ing this, proceeded thither with all his forces, and, each 
nation making every possible exertion, a bloody encounter 
followed : but the English obtained the advantage, and put 
~ Torweg '°^°^^^ight -'^^*, however reluctantly posterity 
may bell6V6 It, one smgle Norwegian for a long time delayed 
the triumph of so many, and such great men. For standing 
on the entrance of the bridge, which is called S tandfo rd 
Brigge,* after having killed several of our party, he pr^- 
vented the whole from passing over. Being invited to sur- 
render, with the assurance that a man of such courage 
should experience the amplest clemency frcnn the English, he 
derided those who entreated him ; and immediately, with 
stem countenance, reproached the set of cowards who were 
unable to resist an individuaL No one approaching nearer, 
as they thought it unadvisable to come to close quarters with 
a man who had desperately rejected eveiy means of safety,

ing about, and too incautious from his security, so that he 
I yielded the victory to the English. The army immediately

paasing over without opposition, destroyed the dispersed and 
fljing Norwegians. King Harfager and Tostj were slain ; 
the long's son, with all the ships, was kindlj sent back to his / , 
own country. Harold, elated by his successful enterprise, 
Touchsafed no part of the spoil to hig soldiers. Wherefore v 
many, as tbey fbund opportunity, stealing away, deserted the \^ 
king, as he was proceeding to the battle of Hastings. For 
with the exception of his stipendiary and mercenary soldiers, ■, ^ 
he had very few of the people* with him ; on which account 
circumvented by a stratagem of William's, he was routed, 
with the army he headed, after possessing the kingdom nine 
DKHiths and some days. The effect of war in this affair was 
trifling ; it was brought about by the secret and wonderful '^ 
counsel of Grod : since the Angles never again, in any general v 
battle, made a struggle for liberty, as if the whole strength V 

of Elngland had fallen with Harold, who certainly might and ^ 

ought to pay the penalty of his perfidy, even though it were 
at the hands of the most unwarlike people. Nor in saying 
this, do I at all derogate from the valour of the Normans, to 
wIkmu I am strongly bound, both by my descent, and for the 
privileges I enjoy. Stillf those persons appear to me to err, 
who au g ment the numbers of the English, and underrate 
their courage ; who, while they design to extol the Normans, 
load them with ignominy. A mighty commendation indeed ! 
that a veiy warlike nation should conquer a set of people 
who were obstructed by their multitude, and fearful through > 
cowardice ! On the contrary, they were few in number and 
brave in the extreme ; and sacrificing every regard to their " ' 
bodies, poured forth their spirit for their country. But, 
however, as these matters await a more detailed narrrative, 
I shall now put a period to my second book, that I may re- 
turn to my composition, and my readers to the perusal of it, 
with fresh ardour.

be conveyed to York, and Harold's march into Sussex to be completed ; ;^ 
of course few could accompany him, but such as were mounted. '^^

had collected immense forces from all parts of England ; and that Den- 
mark had supplied him with auxiliaries also. But the circumstances men- 
tioned in the preceding note show the absurdity of this statement.

PREFACE. 

NoBMAirs and English, incited bj different motires^ haye 
written of king William: the former have praised him to 
excess ; extoUug to the utmost both his good and his 
bad actions: while the latter, out of national hatred, liave 
laden their conqueror with undeserved reproach. For my 
part, as the blood of either people flows in mj veins, I ahaU 
« steer a middle course: where I am certified of his good 
deeds, I shall openly proclaim them ; his bad conduct I 
/ shall touch upon lightly and sparingly, though not so as to 
conceal it ; so that neither shall my narrative be condemned 
as false, nor will I brand that man with ignominious cen- 
sure, almost the whole of whose actions may reasonably be 
excused, if not commended. Wherefore I shall willingly 
\ and carefully relate such anecdotes of him, as may be mat- 
I ter of incitement to the indolent, or of example to the enter- 
I prising; u^fuljo the prese nt ag ^ anj ple^jng t^ paaterify 
But I shall spend little time in relating such things as are of 
service to no one, and which produce disgust in the reader, 
as' well as ill-will to the author. There are always people, 
more than sufficient, ready to detract from the. actions of the 
noble : my course of proceeding will be, to extenuate evil, as 
/ much as can be consistehtly with truth, and not to bestow 
j excessive commendation even on good actions. For this 
' moderation, as I imagine, ail true judges will esteem me 
neither timid, nor unskilful And this rule too, my history 
I will regard equally, with respect both to William and his 
,' two sons ; that nothing shall be dwelt on too fondly ; nothing 
' untrue shall be admitted. The elder of these did little wor- 
thy of praise, if we except the early part of his reign ; gain- 
ing, throughout the whole of his Ufe, the favour of the 
military at the expense of the people. The second, more 
obsequious to his father than to his brother, possessed his 
spirit, unsubdued either by prosperity or adversity : on re- 
garding his warlike expeditions, it is matter of doubt, 
whether he was more cautious or more bold; on contem- 
plating their event, whether he was more fortunate, or un-

Of WiOiam the FiraL [a.d. 1066—1087.] 

BoBBBT, second son of Richard the Second, afler he had, 
with great glorj, held the duchy of Normandy for seven 
years, resolved on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. He had, at 
that time, a son seven years of age, bom of a concubine, 
whose beauty he had accidentally beheld, as she was dan- 
^ng, and had become so smitten with it, as to form a con- 
nexion with her : after which, he loved her exclusively, and, 
for some time, regarded her as his wife. He had by her 
this boy, named, after his great-great-grandfather, William, 
whose future glory was portended to his mother by a dream ; 
wherein she imagined her intestines were stretched out, and \ 
extended over the whole of Normandy and England: and, < 
at the very moment, also, when the infant burst into life and 
touched the ground, he filled both hands with the rushes 
strewed upon the floor, firmly grasping what he had taken 
up. This prodigy was joyfully ivntnessed by the women, 
gossipping on the occasion ; and the midwife hailed the pro- 
pitious omen, declaring that the boy wotdd be a king. 

Every provision being made for the expedition to Jeru- * 
salem,* the chiefs were summoned to a council at Feschamp, 
where, at his father's command, all swore fidelity to Wil- 
liam : earl Gilbert was appointed his guardian ; and the 
protection of the earl was assigned to Henry, king of 
France. While Robert was prosecuting his journey, the 
Normans, each in his several station, united in common for 
the defence of their country, and regarded their infant lord 
with great affection. This fidelity continued till the report 
was spread of Robert's death, upon which their affection 
changed with his fortune ; and then they began severally to 
fortify their towns, to build castles, to carry in provisions,

«nd to seek the earliest opportonities of reyolting from the 
' ohild. In the meantime, howeyer, donbtlesslj hj the special 
aid of Grod who had destined him to the 8oyereignt7 of such 
an extended empire, he grew up uniigured; while Gilbert, 
almost alone, defended hj arms what was just and right: 
the rest being occupied by the designs of their respective 
parties. But Gilbert being at this time killed by his cousin 
Bodulph, fire and slaughter raged on all sides. The coun- 
try, formerly most flourishing, was now torn with intestine 
>/ broils, and divided at the pleasure of the plunderers ; so that 
it was justly entitled to proclaim, ** Woe to the land whose 
soyereign is a child."* 

William, however, as soon as his age permitted, receiving 
the badge of knighthood from the king of France, inspirited 
the inhabitants to hope for quiet The sower of dissension 
, was one Guy, a Burgundian on his father's side, and grand- 
son to Richard the Second by his daughter. William and 
Guy had been children together, and at that time were 
equally approaching to manhood. Mutual intercourse had 
produced an intimacy between them which had ripened 
into friendship. Moreover, thinking, as they were related, 
that he ought to deny him nothing, he had given him the 
castles of Briony and Vernon. The Burgundian, unmindful 
of this, estranged himself from the ead»^feigning sufficient 
cause of offence to colour his conduct, (it would be tedious, 
and useless, to relate what actions were performed on either 
side, what castles were taken; for his perfidy had found 
abettors in Nigel, viscount of Coutances, Ralph, viscount 
of Bayeux, and Haimo Dentatus, grandfather of Robert, 
who was the occupier of many estates in England in our 
time?! With these persons, this most daring plunderer, al- 
lured by vain expectation of succeeding to the earldom, 
was devastating the whole of Normandy. A sense of duty, 
however, compelled the guardian-king to succour the des- 
perate circumstances of his ward. Remembering, therefore, 
the kindness of his father, and that he had, by his influence, 
exalted him to • the kingdom, he rushed on the revolters at 
Walesdun. Many thousands of them were there slain ; 
many drowned in the river Ome, by its rapidity, while, 
being hard-pressed, they spurred their horses to ford the

current. Guj, escaping with difficulty, betook hioiself to 
Briony; but was driven thence by William^ and unable to 
endure this disgrace, he retired, of his oyhi accord, to Bur- 
gundy, his native soil. Here too his unquiet spirit found no 
rest ; for being expelled thence by his brother, WUliam, earl 
of that province, against whom he had conceived designs, it 
appears not what fate befell him. Nigel and Balph were 
admitted to fealty: Haimo fell in the field of battle; after 
having become celebrated by his remarkable daring for 
having unhorsed the king himself ; in consequence of which 
he was despatched by the surrounding guards, and, in ad- 
miratian of his valour, honourably buried at the king's com- 
mand. King Henry received a compensation for this favour, ' 
when the Norman lord actively assisted him against Geof- 
frey Martel at Herle-Mill, which is a fortress in the country ■ 
of Anjou. For William had now attained his manly vigour ; 
an object of dread even to his elders, and though alone, a 
match for numbers. Unattended he would rush on danger ; 
and when unaccompanied, or with only a few followers, dart 
into the thickest ranks of the enemy. By this expedition 
he gained the reputation of admirable bravery, as well as 
the sincerest regard of the king ; so that, with parental 
affection, he would often admonish him not to hold life in ^ 
contempt by encountering danger so precipitately; a life, ' 
which was the ornament of the French, the safeguard of \ 
the Normans, and an example to both. i 

At that time Geoffirey* was earl of Anjou, who had boast- 
ingly taken the surname of Martel, as he seemed, by a 
certun kind of good fortune, to beat down all his opponents. 
Finally, he had made captive, in open battle, his liege lord, 
the earl of Poitou ; and, loading lum with chains, hod com- 
pelled him to dishonourable terms of peace ; namely, that he 
should yield up Bourdeaux and the neighbouring cities, and 
pay an annual tribute for the rest. But he, as it is thought, 
through the injuries of his confinement and want of food, 
was, after three days, released from eternal ignominy by a 
timely death. Martel then, that his effrontery might be 
complete, married the stepmother of the deceased; taking 
his brothers under his protection until they should be capa-

ble of governing the principality. Next entering the terri- 
tories of Theobald, earl of Blois, he laid si^e to the dty of 
Tours; and while he was hastening to the succour of his 
subjects, made him participate in their afflictions ; for being 
taken, and shut up in prison, he ceded the city from himself 
and his heirs for ever. Who shall dare cry shame on this 
man's cowardice, who, for the enjoyment of a little longer 
life, defrauded his successors for ever of the dominion of 
so great a city? for although we are too apt to be severe 
judges of others, yet we must know, that we should consult 
our own safety, if we were ever to be placed in similar cir- 
cumstances. In this manner Martel, insolent from the ac- 
cession of so much power, obtained possession of the castle 
of Alen9on, even from the earl of Normandy ; its inhabitants 
being faithlessly disposed. Irritated at this outrage, William 
retaUated, and invested Danfrunt, which at that time be- 
longed to the earl of Anjou. Greoffiney, immediately, excited 
by the complaints of the besi^ed, hastily rushed forward 
with a countless force. Hearing of his approach, William 
sends Roger Montgomery* and William Fitz-Osbeme to 
reconnoitre. They, from the activity of youth, proceeding 
many miles in a short time, espied Martel on horseback, and 
apprized 1pm of the dauntless boldness of their lord. Martel 
immediately began to rage, to threaten mightily what he 
would do; and said that he would come thither the next 
day, and show to the world at large how much an Angevin 
could excel a Norman in battle : at the same time, with an- 
paralleled insolence, describing the colour of his horse, and 
the devices on the arms he meant to use. The Norman 
nobles, with equal vanity, relating the same of William, 
return and stimulate their party to the conflict I have 
described these things minutely, for the purpose of display- 
ing the arrogance of Martel. On this occasion, however, he 
manifested none of his usual magnanimity, for he retreated

and, afterwards, those of Danfrunt also, listed under the 
more fortunate standard. 

In succeeding years William, earl of Arches, his illegiti- 
mate uncle, who had always been faithless and fluctuating 
from his first entrance on the duchy, rebelled against him ; 
for, even during the siege of Danfrunt, he had unexpectedly 
stolen away, and had communicated to many persons the 
secrets of his souL In consequence of this, William had 
committed the keeping of his castle to some men, whom he 
had erroneously deemed faithful; but the earl, with his 
usual skill in deception, had seduced even these people to his 
party, by giving them many things, and promising them 
more. Thus possessed of the fortress, he declared war 
against his lord. William, with his customary alacrity, con- 
trary to the advice of his friends, laid siege to Arches, 
declaring publicly, that the miscreants would not dare at- 
tempt any thing, if they came into his sight. Nor was his 
assertion false: for more than three hundred soldiers, who 
had gone out to plunder and forage, the instant they beheld 
him, though almost unattended, fied back into their fortifi- 
cations. Being inclined to settle this business without blood- 
shed, he fortified a castle in front of Arches, and turned to 
matters of hostile operation which required deeper attention, 
because he was aware that the king of France, who had 
already become adverse to him from some unknown cause, 
was hastening to the succour of the besieged. He here gave 
an instance of very laudable forbearance ; for though he cer- 
tainly appeared to have the juster cause, yet he was reluctant 
to engage with that person, to whom he was bound both by 
oath and by obligation. He left some of his nobility, how- 
ever, to repress the impetuosity of the king ; who, falling 
into an ambush laid by their contrivance, had most de- 
servedly to lament Isembard, earl of Fonthieu, who was 
killed in his sight, and Hugh Bardulf, who was taken 
prisoner. Not long after, in consequence of his miscarriage, 
retiring to his beloved France, the earl of Arches, wasted 
with hunger, and worn to a skeleton, consented to surrender, 
and was preserved, life and limb, an example of clemency, 
and a proof of perseverance. During the interval of this 
siege, liie people of the fortress called Moulin, becoming dis-

affected, at the Indtagalion of one Walter, went over to tlie 
king's side. « An active part7 of soldiers was placed there, 
under the command of Gnj, brother of the earl of Poitou, 
who diligently attended for some time to his militarj duties : 
but on hearing the report of the victory at Arches, he stole 
away into France, and contributed, by these mea&8> consider- 
ably to the glory of the dake. 

King Henry, however, did not give indulgence to inac- 
tivity ; but, muttering that his armies had been a laughing- 
stock to William, immediately collected all his fwces, and, 
dividing them into two bodies, he over-ran the whole of 
Normandy^ He himself headed all the military power which 
came from that part of Celtic Graul which lies between the 
rivers Garonne and Seine; and gave his brother Odo the 
command over such as came from that part of Belgic Craul 
which is situated between the Rhine and the Seine. In like 
manner William divided his army, with all the skill he pos- 
sessed ; approaching by degrees the camp of the king, which 
was pitehed in the country of Briony, in such a manner, as 
neither to come to close engagement, nor yet suffer the pro- 
vince to be devastated in his presence. His generab were 
Robert, earl of Aux ; Hugo de Goumay, Hugo de Montfort, 
and William Crispin, who opposed Odo at a town called 
Mortemar. Nor did he, relying on the numerous army 
which he commanded, at all delay coming to action; yet 
making only slight resistance at the beginning, and after- 
wards being unable to withstand the attack of the Normans, 
he retreated, and was himself the first to fiy. And here, 
while Guy, earl of Ponthieu, was anxiously endeavouring to 
revenge lus brother, he was made captive, and feh, together 
with many others surpassing in affluence and rank, the 
weight of that hand which was so fatal to his family. When 
William was informed of this success by messengers, he took 
care that it should be proclaimed in the dead of night, near 
the king's tent. On hearing which he retired, after some 
days spent in Nonnandy, into fVance ; and, soon after, am- 
bassadors passing between them, it was concluded, by ti'eaty, 
that the king's partisans should be set at liberty, and that 
the earl should become legally possessed of all that had been, 
or should hereafter be, taken from MartoL

petaal contentions, or how William always came off con- ^- 
qaeror. What shall we say besides, when, magnanimously ^ 

despising the custom of modem times, he never conde- 
acended to attack him suddenly, or without acquainting him 
of the day. Moreover, I pass by the circumstance of king ^ 

Henry^s again violating his friendship; his entering Nor- 
mandy, and proceeding through the district of Hiesmes to 
the river Dive, boasting that the sea was the sole obstacle 
to his farther progress. But William now perceiving him- ^ 

self reduced to extremities by the king's perfidy, at length ( ^ 

brandished the arms of conscious valour, and worsted the 
royal forces which were beyond the river — ^for part of them, 
hearing of his arrival, had passed over some little time be- 
fore — ^with such entire loss, that henceforth France had no 
such object of dread as that of irritating the ferocity of the 
/Normans. The death of Henry soon foUowing, and, shortly ' ' ^ 
/ after, that of Martel, put an end to these broils. The djong 
, king delegated the care of his son Philip, at that time ex- 
tremely young, to Baldwin earl of Flimders. He was a f 
man equally celebrated for fidelity and wisdom; in the full/ 
possession of bodUy strength, and also ennobled by a mar- 1 
riagi^ with the king's sister. His daughter, Matilda, a wo- ^' 
man who was a singular mirror of prudence in our time, 
and the perfection of virtue, had been already married to 
William. Hence it arose, that being mediator between his 
ward, and his son-in-law, Baldwin restrained, by his whole- . 
some counsels, the feuds of the chiefs, and of the people. 

But since the mention of Martel has so often presented 
itself, I shall briefly trace the genealogy of the earls of i 
Anjou,* as far as the knowledge of my informant reaches. , 
Fulk the elder, presiding over that county for many years, 
until he became advanced in years, performed many great 
and prudent actions. There is only one thing for which I 
have heard him branded: for, having induced Herbert earl 
of Maine to come to Saintes, under the promise of yielding 
bim that city, he caused him, in the midst of their conversa- 
tion, to be surrounded by his attendants, and compelled him 
to submit to his own conditions: in other respects he was

a man of irreproachable integrity. In his latter days, he 
ceded his principalitj to Geoffrey his son so often mentioned. 
Greoffrej conducted himself witii excessive barbarity to the 
inhabitants, and with equal haughtiness even to the person 
who had conferred this honour upon him: on which, being 
ordered by his father to lay down the government and en- 
signs of authority, he was arrogant enough to take up arms 
againsf him. The blood of the old man, though grown cold 
and languid, yet boiled with indignation ; and in the course 
of a few days, by adopting wiser counsels, he so brought 
down the proud spirit of his son, that after carrying his 
saddle* on his back for some miles, he cast himself with 
his burden at his father s feet He, fired once more with 
his ancient courage, rising up and spurning the prostrate 
youth with his foot, exclaimed, "You are conquered at last! 
you are conquered I" repeating his words several times. 
The suppliant had still spirit enough to make this admirable 
xeply, "I am conquered by you alone, because you are my 
father ; by others I am utterly invincible.** With this 
speech his irritated mind was mollified, and having con- 
soled the mortification of his son by paternal affection, he 
restored him to the principality, with admonitions to conduct 
himself more wisely : telling him that the prosperity and 
tranquillity of the people were creditable to him abroad, as 
well as advantageous at home. In the same year the old 
man, having discharged all secular concerns, made pro- 
vision for his soul, by proceeding to Jerusalem ; where com- 
pelling two servants, by an oath to do whatever he com- 
\ manded, he was by them publicly dragged naked, in the 
sight of the Turks, to the holy sepulchre. One of them 
had twisted a withe about his neck, the other with a rod 
scourged his bare back, whilst he cried out^ "Lord, receive 
the wretched Fulk, thy perfidious, thy runagate ; r^ard my 
repentant soul, O Lord Jesu Christ. At this time he ob- 
tained not his request; but, peacefully returning home, he 
died some few years after. The precipitate bol^ess of his

son Greoffirey has been amply displayed in my preceding his- 
tory. He dying, bequeathed to Geoffrey, his sister's son, his 
inheritance, but his worldly industry he could not leave him. 
For being a youth of simple manners, and more accustomed 
to pray in church, than to handle arms, he excited the con- 
tempt of the people of that^untry, who knew not how to 
live in quiet In consequence, the whole district becoming 
exposed to plunderers, Fulk, his brother, of his own ac- 
cord, seized on the duchy. Fulk was called Rhechin, from 
his perpetual growling at the simplicity of his brother, whom 
he finally despoiled of his dignity, and kept in continual cus- 
tody. He had a wife, who, being enticed by the desire of 
enjoying a higher title, deserted him and married Philip king 
of France; who so desperately loved her, regardless of the 
adage, 

'' Majesty and lore 
But ill accord, nor share the Belf-same seat," 

that he patiently suffered himself to be completely governed 
by her, though he was at the same time desirous of ruling 
over every other person. Lastly, for several years, merely 
through regard for her, he suffered himself to be pointed at 
like an idiot, and to be exconmiunicated from the whole 
Christian world. The sons of Fulk were Geoffrey and 
Fulk. Greoffrey obtaining the hereditary surname of Mar- ^ . 
tel, ennobled it by his exertions : for he procured such peace \J 
and tranquillity in those parts, as no one ever had seen, or 
will see in future. On this account being killed by the 
treachery of his people, he forfeited the credit of his con- 
summate worth. Fulk succeeding to the government, is yet 
living ;* of whom as I shall perhaps have occasion to speak 
in the times of king Henry, I will now proceed to relate 
what remains concerning William. 

When, after much labour, he had quelled all civil dissen- 
sion, he meditated an exploit of greater fame, and deter- 
mined to recover those countries anciently attached to Nor- 
mandy, though now disunited by long custom. I allude to

the coanties of Maine and Brittany ; of which Mans, long 
sinoe burnt by Martel and deprived of its sovereign Hugo, 
had lately experienced some little respite under Herbert tiie 
son of Hugo ; who, with a view to greater security against 
the earl of Anjou, had submitted, and sworn fidelity to Wil- 
liam : besides, he had solicited his daughter in marriage, 
and had been betrothed to her, though he died by disease 
ere she was marriageable. He left William his heir, ad« 
juring his subjects to admit no other; tellii^ them, they 
might have, if they chose, a mild and honourable lord; 
but, should they not, a most determined assertor of his 
right On his decease, the inhabitants of Maine rather in- 
/' clined to Walter of Mantes, who had married Hugo's sister : 
\ but at length, being brought to their senses by many heavy 
\ losses, they acknowledged William. This was the time^ 
when Harold was unwillingly carried to Normandy by an 
i/ unpropiti^"gaIe7 whom, as is before mentioned, William 
took with him in his expedition to Brittany, to niake. proof 
I of his prowess, and, at the same time, with the deeper de- 
/sign of showing to him his military equipment, that he 
Vjnight perceive how far preferable was the Norman sword 
J to the English battle-axe. Alan, at that time, earl of Brit- 
tany, flourishing in youth, and of tranisoendent strength, had 
overcome his uncle Eudo, and performed many famous ac- 
tions ; and so far from fearing William, had even voluntarily 
irritated him. But he, laying claim to Brittany as h^ 
hereditary territory, because Charles had given it with his 
daughter, Gisla, to Rollo, shortly acted in such wise^ that 
. Alan came suppliantly to him, and surrendered himaelf and 
his possessions. And since I shall have but little to say of 
Brittany hereafter, I will here briefly insert an extraordinary 
occurrence, which happened about that time in the city of 
Nantes. 

There were in that city two clerks, who though not yet of 
legal age, had obtained the priesthood from the bishop of 
that place, more by entreaty than desert : the pitiable death 
of one of whom, at length taught the survivor, how near 
they had before been to the brink of hell. As to the know- 
ledge of literature, they were so instructed, that they wanted 
little of perfection. From their earliest infancy, they had in 
such wise vied in offices of friendship, that according to the

expresBion of tlie comic writer,* " To serve eacli other they 
woald not only stir hand and foot, but even risk the loss of 
Hfe itself." Wherefore, one day, when they found their 
minds more than nsually free from outward cares, they spoke 
their sentiments, in a secret place, to the following effect : 
" That for many years they had given their attention some- 
times to literatu re, and sometimes to s ecular care s ; nor had 
they satisfied their minds, which had been occupied rather in 
wrong than proper pursuits ; that in the meanwhile, the J "^ 
bitter day was insensibly approaching, which would burst ^^<^ ^ 
the bond of union which was indissoluble while life remained : ^^ 
wherefore they should provide in time, that the friendship 
which united them while living should accompany him who 
died first to the place of the dead." They agreed, therefore, 
that whichever should first depart, should certainly appear to . ' 
the survivor, either waking or sleeping, if possible within j |^ 
thirty days, to inform him, that, accor^ng to the Platonic tenet, i ^^ 
death does not extinguish the spirit^ but sends it back again, A 
as it were from prison, to God its author. K this did not|| 
take place, then they must yield to the sect of the Epicureansy4 
who hold, that the soul, liberated from the body, vanishes ^ 
into air, or mingles with the wind. Mutually plighting their 
faith, tiiey repeated this oath in their daily conversation. 
A short time elapsed, and behold a violent death suddenly 
deprived one of them of Ufe. The other remained, and 
seriously revolving the promise of his friend, and constantly 
expecting his presence, during thirty days, found his hopes 
disappointed. At the expiration of this time, when, despair- 
ing of seeing him, he had occupied his leisure in other busi- 
ness, the deceased, with that pale countenance which dying 
persons assume, suddenly stood before him, when awake, and 
busied on some matter. The dead first addressing the living 
man, who was silent : "Do you know me T said he ; "I ^ 
do," replied the other ; '^ nor am I so much disturbed at 
your Imusual presence, as I wonder at your prolonged ab- 
sence." But when he had accounted for the tardiness of his 
appearance ; " At length," said he, " at length, having over- 
come every impediment, I am present ; which presence, if 
you please, my friend, will be advantageous to you, but to 
me totally unprofitable ; for I am doomed, by a sentence

which has been pronounced and f^pproved, to eternal piinisli- 
ment." When the liying man promised to give all his pro- 
y pertj to monasteries, and to the poor, and to spend days and 
nights in fasting and prayer, for the release of the delnnct ; 
he replied, ^ What I hare said is fixed ; for the judgments 
of Grod, by which I am plunged in the sulphureous whirl- 
pool of heU, are without repentance. There I shall be tossed 
for my crimes, as long as the pole whirls round the stars, or 
ocean beats the shores. The rigour of this irreversible sen- 
tence remains for ever, devising lasting and innumerable 
kinds of punishment : now, therefore, let the whole world 
seek for availing remedies ! And that you may experience 
some little of my numberless pains, behold," said he, stretch- 
ing out his hand, dripping with a corrupted ulcer, *^ one of 
the very smallest of them ; does it appear tjrifling to you T 
When the other replied, that it did appear so ; he bent his 
fingers into the palm, and threw three drops of the purulent 
y^ matter upon him ; two of which touching his^temples, and 
one^his forehead, penetrated the skin and fiesh, as if with a 
burning cautery, and made holes of the size of a nut When 
his friend acknowledged the acuteness of the pain, by the 
cry he uttered, '* This," said the dead man, '' will be a strong 
proof to you, as long as you live, of my pains ; and, unless 
you neglect it, a singular token for your salvation. Where- 
fore, while you have the power; while indignation is sus- 
pended over your head ; while God's lingering mercy waits 
for you ; change your habit, change your disposition ; be- 
come a monk at Bennes, in the monastery of St Melanius.* 
When the living man was unwilling to agree io^these words, 
the other, sternly glancing at him, " If you doubt, wretched 
man," said he, *' turn and read these letters ;" and with these 
words, he stretched out his hand, inscribed with black charac- 
ters, in which, Satan, and all the company of infemals sent 
their thanks, from hell, to the whole ecclesiastical body ; as 
rwell for denying themselves no single pleasure, as for siding, 
.through neglect of their preaching, so many of their subject- 
• souls to hell, as no former age had ever witnessed. With 
^these words the speaker vanished ; and the hearer dis- 
tributing his whole property to the church and to the p^r, 
went to the monastery ; admonishing all, who heard or saw 
him, of his sudden conversion, and extraordinary interview,

80 that thej exclaimed, ** It is the right hand of the Almighty 
that has done this."^^^ ^ v 

I feel no regret at hainuig inserted this for the benefit of w '^ 
my readers : now I shall return to William. For since I 
have briefly, but I hope not uselessly, gone over the transac- 
tions in which he was engaged, when only earl of Normandy, 
for thirty years, the order of time now requires a new series "^ 
of relation ; that I may, as far as my inquiries hare dis- 
covered, detect fallacy, and declare the truth relating to his ^ 
r^gal government. \ 

When king Edward had yielded to fate, England, fluc- 
tuating with doubtful favour, was uncertain to which ruler 
she should conunit herself : to Harold, William, or Edgitr : ^ 
for the king had recommended him also to the nobility, as 
nearest to t£e sovereignty in point of birth ; concealing his 
better judgment from the tenderness of his disposition^ 
Wherefore, as I have said above, the English were distracted 
in their choice, although all of them openly wished well to 
Harold. He, indeed, once dignified with the diadem, thought 
nothing of the covenant between himself and William : he 
said, that he was absolved from his oath, because his daughter, 
to whom he had been betrothed, had died before she was 
marriageable. For this man, though possessing numberless 
good qualities, is reported to have been careless about ab- 
staining from perfidy, so that he could, by any device, elude 
the reasonings of men on this matter. Moreover, supposing 
that the threats of William would never be put into execution, 
because he was occupied in wars with neighbouring princes, 
he had, with his subjects, given full indulgence to security. 
For indeed, had he not heard that the king of Norway was 
approaching, he would neither have condescended to collect 
troops, nor to array them. William, in the meantime, began 
mildly to address him by messengers rto expostulate on the 
broken covenant ; to mingle threats with entreaties ; and to 
warn him, that ere a year expired, he would claim his due 
by the sword, and that he would come to that place, where 
Harold supposed he had firmer footing than himself. Harold 
again rejoined what I have related, concerning the nuptials 
(^ his daughter, and added, that he had been precipitate on 
the subject of the kingdom, in having confirmed to him by 
oath another's right, without the universal consent and edict

of the general meeting, and of the people: again, that a rash 
oath ought to be broken ; for if the oath, or vow, which a 
maiden, under her father's roof^ made concerning her person, 
without the knowledge of her parents, was a^ud^ed invalid ; 
how much more invalid must that oath be, which he had 
made concerning the whole kingdom, when under the king's 
authority, compelled by the necessity of the time, and with- 
out the knowledge of the nation.* Besides it was an unjust 
request^ to ask him to resign a government which he had 
assumed bj the universal kindness of his fellow subjects, 
and which would neither be agreeable to the people, nor safe 
for the military* 

iln this way, confounded either by true, or plausible, argu- 
ments, the messengers returned without success. The earl, 
however, made every necessary preparation for war during 
the whole of that year ; retained his own soldiers with in- 
creased pay, and invited those of others : ordered his ranks 
and battalions in such wise, that the soldiers should be tall 
and stout; that the commanders and standard-bearers, in 
addition to their military science, should be looked up to for 
their wisdom and age ; insomuch^ that each of them, whether 
seen in the field or elsewhere, might be taken for a prince, 
rather than a leader. The bishops and abbats of those days 
vied so much in religion, and the nobility in princely libe- 
rality, that it is wonderful,! within a period of less than 
sixty ^ years, how either order should have become so un- 
fruitful in goodness, as to take up a confederate war against 
[ justice: the former, through desire of ecclesiastical promo- 
\ tion, embracing wrong in preference to right and equity ; 
* and the latter, casting off shame, and seeking every occasion 

* ** These words seem to imply that the Great Council of the kingdom 
had never agreed to any settlement of the crown on the duke ; and with- 
out such sanction no oath made by Harold in favour of William would 
have been binding " — Hardt.

as follows : — ** that in the coune of a very few yean, many, if not 

all, things were seen changed in either order. The former became, in some 
respects, more dull but more liberal: the latter, more prudent in eveiy 
thing, but more penurious ; yet both, in defending their countiv, valiant in 
battle, provident in coimsel ; prepared to advance their own JU>rtune, and 
to depress that of their enemies."

for begging monej as for their dailj pay. But at that time > > 
the prudence of William, seconded bj the providence of God, / 
already anticipated the invasion of England; and that no 
rashness might stain his just cause, he sent to the pope, for- 
merly Anaelm, bishop of Lucca, who had assumed the name 
of Alexander, alleging the justice of the war which he medi- 
tated with aJl the doquence he was master of. Harold 
omitted to do this, either because he was proud by nature, . 
or else distrusted his cause; or because he feared that his 
messengers would be obstructed by William and his parti- ^ 

sans, who beset every port. The pope, duly examining the ^ 

pretensions of both parties, delivered a standard to William, 
as an auspicious presage of the kingdom: on receiving / 
which, he sunmioned an assembly of his nobles, at Lillebourne, V 
for the purpose of ascertaining their sentiments on this 
attempt. And when he had confirmed, by splendid pro- 
mises, all who approved his design, he appointed them to 
prepare shipping, in proportion to the extent of their pos- 
sessions. Thus they departed at that time; and, in the 
month of August, re-assembled in a body at St. Yallery,* 
for so that port is called by its new name. Collecting, 
therefore, ships from every quarter, they awaited the pro- 
pitious gale which was to carry them to their destination. 
When this delayed blowing for several days, the common . 
soldiers, as is generaUy the case, began to mutter in their , 
tents, " that the man must be mad, who wished to subjugate i 
a foreign country ; that God opposed hi^n, who withheld the ' 
wind; that his father purposed a similar attempt, and was 
in like manner firustrated ; that it was the fate of that family 
to aspire to things beyond their reach, and find God for their 
adversary." In consequence of these things, which were 
enough to enervate the force of the brave, being publicly 
noised abroad, the duke held a council with his chiefs, and 
ordered the body of St Yallery to be brought forth, and to ' 
be exposed to the open air, for the purpose of imploring a j '

large aeo-port town, situated in Normandy, in the diocese of Rouen, and 
was formerly called S. Valeri les Plains, but now S. Valeri en Cauz. It 
seems to be the former place to which Malmesbuiy here refers, ^ In Pon- 
tivo apud S. Walericum in aaooris congrue stare fecit,' writes William of

wind. No delay now interposed, but the wished-for gale 
filled their sails. A joyful clamour then arising, summoned 
every one to the slups. The earl himself fii^t launching 
from the continent into the deep, awaited the rest, at anchor, 
nearly in mid-channel. All then assembled round the crim- 
son sail of the admiral's ship ; and, having first dined, they 
arrived, after a favourable passage, at Hastings. As he dis- 
embarked he slipped down, but turned the accident to his 
advantage; a soldier who stood near calling out to him, 
'^ you hold England, * my lord, its future king." He then 
restrained his whole army fix>m plundering ; warning them, 
thav they should now abstain from what must hereafter be 
their own;! and for fifteen successive days he remained so 
perfectly quiet, that he seemed to think of nothing less than 
of war. 

In the meantime Harold returned from the battle with 
the Norwegians; happy, in his own estimation, at having 
conquered ; but not so jn mine^ as he had secured the victory 
by parricide. When the news of the Norman's arrival 
reached him, reeking as he was from battle, he proceeded to 
Hastings, though accompanied by very few forces. No 
doubt the fates urged him on, as he neither summoned his

more particuUrly under Hollington, Bexhill, &c. The value of each 
manor is given as it stood in the reign of the conqueror ; afterwards it is 
said, * vastatum fuit;' and then follows the value at the time of the surrey. 
The situation of those manors evidently shows their devastated state to 
have been owing to the army marching over it ; and this clearly evinces 
another circumstance relating to the mvasion, which is, that William did 
not land his army at one particular spot, at Bulwerhithe, or Hastings, as is 
supposed, — but at all the several proper places for landing along the 
from Bexhill to Winchelsea." — Hardt.

troops, nor, had he been willing to do so, would he haye 
found many ready to obey his call; so hostile were all to 
him, as I have before observed, from his having appropriated 
the northern spaHiA entirely to himself. He sent out some/ 
persons, however, to reconnoitre the number and strength of 
the enemy: these, being taken within the camp, William 
ordered to be led amongst the tents, and, after feasting 
them plentifully, to be sent back uninjured to their lord. 
On their return, Harold inquired what news they brought: ' ^ 

when, after relating at fuU, the noble confidence of the 
genend, they gravely added, that almost all his army had the 
appearance of priests, as they had the whole face, with both 
Ups, shaven. For the English leave the upper lip unshorn, 
suffering the hair continually to increase; which Julius 
Csesar, in his treatise on the Gallic War,* affirms to have 
been a national custom with the ancient inhabitants of. . . « ./ 
Britain. The king smiled at the simplicity of the relators, 
observing, with a pleasant laugh, that they were not priests, 
but soldiers, strong in arms, and invincible in spirit. His 
brother, Girth, a youth, on the verge of manhood, and of 
knowledge and valour surpassing his years, caught up his 
words : ** Since," said he, '* you extol so much the valour of 
the Norman, I think it ill-advised for you, who are his 
inferior in strength and desert, to contend with him. Nor 
can you deny being bound to him, by oath, either willingly, 
or by compidsion. Wherefore you will act wisely, if, your- 
self withdrawing from this pressing emergency, you allow us 
to try the issue of a battle. We, who are £ree from all obli- 
gation, shall justly draw the sword in defence of our country. 
It is to be apprehended, if you engage, that you wiU be 
either subjected to flight or to death : whereas, if we only 
fight, your cause will be safe at all events : for you will be 
able both to rally the fugitives, and to avenge the dead." 

His unbridled rashness yielded no placid ear to the words 
of his adviser, thinking it base, and a reproach to his past 
ilCe, to turn his back on danger of any kind; and, with 
similar impudence, or to speak more favourably, imprudence, 
he drove away a monk, the messenger of William, not deign- 
ing him even a complacent look ; imprecating only, that God 
would decide between him and the earL He was the bearer

fof three propositions; either that Harold should reliiiqaish 
t the kingdom, according to ^ his agreement, or hold it of 
I William ; or decide the matter bj single combat in the sight 
v>^ of either army. For William* claimed the kingdom, on the 
ground that king Edward, by the advice of Stigand, the 
archbishop, and of the earls Godwin and Siward, had 
granted it to him, and had sent the son and nephew of God- 
win to Normandy, as sureties of the grant. If Harold 
should deny this, he would abide by the judgment of the 
pope, or by battle : on all which propositions, the messenger 
being frustrated by the single answer I have related, re- 
turned, and communicated to his party fresh spirit for the 
conflict. 
I\ The courageous leaders mutually prepared for battle, each 
f I according to his national custom. The English, as we have 
(heard, passed the night without sleep, in dnnking and sing- 
ing, and, in the morning, proceeded without delay towards 
the enemy; all were on foot, armed with battle-axes, and 
covering themselves in front by the junction of their sMelds, 
they formed an impenetrable body, which would have se- 
cured their safety that day, had not the Normans, by a 
,\ feigned flight, induced them to open their ranks, which till 
that time, according to their custom, were closely compacted. 
The king himself on foot, stood, with his brother, near the 
standard ; in order that, while idl shared equal danger, none 
might think of retreating. This standanl William sent, 
after the victory, to the pope ; it was sumptuously embroi- 
dered, with gold and precious stones, in the form of a man 
fighting. 

On the other side, the Normans passed the whole night 
in confessing their sins, and received the sacrament in the 
morning : their infantry, with bows and arrows, formed the 
vanguard, while their cavalry, divided into wings, were 
thrown back. The earl, with serene countenance^ declaring 
aloud, that God would favour his, as being tiie righteous 
side, called for his arms ; and presently, when, through the

hurry of his attendants, he had put on his hauberk the hind 
part before,* he corrected the mistake with a laugh ; saying, 
^ My dukedom shall be turned into a kingdom.'' Then be- 
ginning the song of Roland,f that the warlike example of 
that man might stimulate the soldiers, and calling on Gk)d 
for assistance, the battle conmienced on both sides. They 
fought with ardour, neither giving ground, for great part 
of the day. Finding this, WilHam gave a signal to his party, "^ h 
that, by a feigned flight, they should retreat Through tins / 

device, the dose body of the English, opening for the pur- \ 

pose of cutting down the straggling enemy, brought upon 
itself swift destruction; for the Normans, ffudng about, at- 
tacked them thus disordered, and compeUed them to fly. In 
this manner, deceived by a stratagem, they met an honour- 
able death in aveii^ing their country ; nor indeed were they 
at all wanting to their own revenge, as, by frequently making 
a stand, they slaughtered their pursuers in heaps : for, get- 
ting possession of an eminence, they drove down the Nor- 
mans, when roused with indignation and anxiously striving 
to gain the higher ground, into the valley beneath, where, 
easily hurling tiieir javelins and rolling down stones on them 
as they stood below, they destroyed them to a man. Be- 
sides, by a short passage, with which they were acquainted, 
avoiding a de^ ditch, they trod under foot such a multitude 
of their enemies in that place, that they made the hoUow ' 
level with the plain, by the heaps of carcasses. This vicissi- 
tude of first one party conquering, and then the other, pre- . 
vailed as long as the Hfe of Harold continued ; but when he ^ 
fell, from having his brain pierced with an arrow, the flight 
of the Ei^lish ceased not until night. The valour of both 
leaders was here eminently conspicuous. 

Harold, not merely content with the duty of a general in 
exhorting others, diligently entered into every soldier-like 
office; often would he strike the enemy when coming to 
dose quarters, so that none could, approach him with im- 
punity; for immediately the same blow levelled both horse 
and rider. Wherefore, as I have related, receiving the fatal

arrow from a distance, he yielded to death. One of the 
qI soldiers with a sword gashed his thigh, as he lay prostrate ; 
for which shameful and cowardly action, he was branded 
with ignominy by William, and dismissed the service. 

William too was equally ready to encourage by his voice 
and by his presence; to be the first to rush forward; to 
attack the thickest of the foe. Thus everywhere raging, 
everywhere furious, he lost three choice horses, which were 
that day pierced under him. The dauntless spirit and 
vigour of the intrepid general, however, still persisted, 
though often called back by the kind remonstrance of his 
body-guard ; he still persisted, I say, till approaching night 
crowned him with complete victory. And no doubt^ the 
I hand of God so protected him, that the enemy should draw 
! no blood from his person, though they aimed so many jave- 
> lins at him. 

This was a &tal day to England, a melancholy havoc of 

* our dear country, through its change of masters. For it 
had long since adopted the manners of the Angles, which 
had • been very various according to the times : for in the 
first years of their arrival, they were barbarians in their 
look and manners, warlike in their usages, heathens in their 
rites ; but, after embracing the faith of Christ, by d^rees, 
and in process of time, from the peace they enjoyed, r^ard- 

' ing arms only in a secondary light, they gave their whole 
attention to religion. I say nothing of the poor, the mean- 
ness of whose fortune often restrains them £rmn overstepping 

• the bounds of justice: I omit men of ecclesiastical rank, 
whom sometimes respect to their profession, and sometimeft 
the fear of shame, suffer not to deviate from the truth: I 
speak of princes, who from the greatness of their power 
might have full liberty to indulge in pleasure; some of 
whom, in their own countiy, and others at Rome, changing 
their habit, obtained a heavenly kingdom, and a saintlj 
intercourse. Many during their whole lives in outward 
appearance only embraced the present world,, in order that 
they might exhaust their treasures on the poor, or divide 
them amongst monasteries. What shall I say of the multi- 
tudes of bishops, hermits, ^d abl^ ? Does not the whole 
island blaze with such nuMerous^^lics of its natives, that 
you can scarcely pass a villajge of any consequence but you

hear the name of some new saint, besides the numbers of 
whom all notices have perished through the want of records ? 
^Weyertheless, in process of time, the desire after literature 
and religion had decayed, for several years before the arrival ^ 
of the Normans, ^he clergy, contented with a very slight 
degree of learning, could scarcely stammer out the words of 
the sacraments ; and a person who understood grammar, was 
an object of wonder and astonishment. The monks mocked \^ 
_^ejQilfi,jj£^eir pjcder by fine vestments, an3*"tlie use. of v 
eve ry kind^ of food. The nobShj^ffT^^up to luxury and jc 

wantonness^ went not to church in the morning after the " ^ 
manner of Christians, but merely, in a careless manner, "j 
heard matins and masses from a hurrying priest in their < i 
chambers, amid the blandishments of their wives. The 
commonalty, left unprotected, became a prey to the most . 
powerful, who amassed fortunes, by either seizing on their 
property, or by selling their persons into foreign countries; 
although it be an innate quality of this people, to be more 
inclined to revelling, tlian to the accumulation of wealth. 
There was one custom, repugnant to nature, which they 
adopted; namely, to sell their female servants, when preg- 
nant by them and after they had satisfied their lust, either 
to public prostitution, or foreign slavery. Drinking in par- 
ties was a universal practice, in which occupation they 
passed entire nights as well as days. They consumed their 
whole substance in mean and despicable houses; unlike the 
K^mnntnfl i^j^A TtVffnph^ ^hn, in uoblc and Splendid mansions, '^ 
lived w ith fru g^ty . The vices attendant' on drunkenness, ! 
which enervate the human mind, followed; hence it arose \ 
that engaging William, more with rashness, and precipitate 
fury, than mUitary skill, they doomed themselves, and their 1 
country to slavery, by one, and that an easy, victory. " For 
nothing is less effective than rashness ; and what begins with 
violence, quickly ceases, or is repelled." In fine, the English 
at that time, wore short garments reaching to the mid-knee ; 
they had their hair cropped ; their beards shaven ; their arms 
laden with golden bracelets ; their skin adorned with punc- > 
tared designs. They were accustomed to eat till they be- 
came surfeited, and to drink till they were sick. These 
latter qualities they imparted to their conquerors ; as to the 
rest, they adopted their manners. I would not, however,

have these bad propensities uniyersallj ascribed to the Eng- 
lish. I know that many of the clergy, at that day, trod the 
path of sanctity, by a blameless life; I know that many of 
the laity, of all ranks and conditions, in this nation, were 
well-pleasing to God* Be injustice far from this account; 
the accusation does not involve the whole indiscriminately. 
''But, as in peace, the mercy of Grod often cherishes the 
bad and the good together; so^ equally, does his severity, 
sometimes, indude them both in captivity." 
, Moreover, the Normans, that I may speak of them als(^ 
/were at that time, and are even now, proudly apparelled, 
I delicate in their food, but not excessive. They are a race 
I m ured to war, and can hardly live without it ; fierce in rush- 
/ ing against the enemy ; and where strength fails of suocessi 
\_jready to use stratagem, or to corrupt by bribery. As I have 
( related, they live in large edifices with economy ; envy their 
V equals; wish to excel their superiors; and plunder .their 
subjects, though they defend them from others ; they are 
fMtmul to their lords, though a slight offence renders them 
Idious. They weigh treachery by its jchance ofsucce sB, 
change their sentiments with nrcm^nDhey are, however, 
le kindest of nations, and they esteem strangers worthy of 
equal honour with themselves. They also intennany with 
' their vassals. They revived, by their arrival, the observ- 
ances of religion, which were everywhere grown lifeless in 
., England. You might see churches rise in every village, and 
pionasteries in the towns and cities, built after a style un- 
known before ; you might behold the country flourishing 
^ ' with renovated rites ; so that each wealthy man accounted 
. that day lost to him, which he had neglected to signalize by 
^«ome magnificent action. But having enlarged sufficient^ 
on these points,^et us pursue the transactions of William. 

When his victory was complete, he caused his dead to be 
interred with great pomp ; granting the enemy the liberty of 
doing the like, if they thought proper. He sent the body of 
Harold* to his mother, who b^ged it^ imransomed ; though 

f * There seems to have been a fiBbulous stofy cunent during the twelfth 

f centuiy, that Harold escaped from the battle of Hastings. Ghaldus Cam- 

brensis asserts, that it was believed Harold had fled from the battle-6eld, 

pierced with manpr wounds, and with the loss of his left eye ; and that he 

ended his days piously and virtuously, as an anchorite, at Chester. Both

she proffered large sums bj her messengers. She buried it, 
when thus obtained, at Waltham ; a church which he had 
built at his own expense, in honour of the Holy Cross, and 
had endowed for canons. William then, bj degrees proceed- 
ing, as became a conqueror, with his armj, not after an hos- 
tile, but a royal manner, journeyed towards London, the 
principal city of the kingdom ; and shortly after, all the 
citizens came out to meet him with gratulations. Crowds 
poured out of every gate to greet him, instigated by the 
nobility, and principally by Stigand, archbishop of Canter- 
bury, and Aldred, of York. For, shortly before, Edwin and / 
Morcar, two brothers of great expectation, hearing, at Lon- { 
don, the news of Harold's death, solicited the citizens to i 
exalt one of them to the throne : faiUng, however, in the 
attempt, they had departed for Northumberland, conjecturing, 
from their own feelings, that William would never come 
thither. The other chie^ would have chosen Edgar, had the 
bishops supported them ; but, danger and domestic broils 
closely impending, neither did this take effect. Thus the 
Engli&h, who, had they united in one opinion, might have 
repaired the ruin of their country, introduced a stranger, 
while they were unwilling to choose a native, to govern them. 
Being now decidedly hailed king, he was crowned on Christ- 
mas-day by archbishop Aldred ; for he was careful not to 
accept this office from Stigand, as he was not canonically an 
archbishop. 

Of the various wars which he carried on, this is a sum- 
mary. Favoured by God's assistance, he easily reduced the 
city of Exeter,* when it had rebelled ; for part of the wall

he is represented, in his interview with Henry II. to have spoken myste- 
liouflly respecting Harold, and to have declared that the body of that prince 
was not at WaHham. Sir H. Ellis, quoting this MS., justly observes, that 
the whole was, probably, the &brication of one of the secular canons, who

fell down accidentallj, and made an opening for him. In- 
deed he had attacked it with the more ferocity, asserting 
that those irreverent men would be deserted by Grod's favour, 
. 1 because one of them, standing upon the wall, had bared his 
tV iposteriors, and had broken wind, in contempt of the Nor- 
mans. He almost annihilated the city of York, that sole re- 
thiaining shelter for rebellion, and destroyed its citizens with 
0word and famine. For there Malcolm, king of the Scots, 
with his party ; there Edgar, and Morcar, and Waltheof, 
with the English and Danes, often brooded over the nest of 
tyranny ; there they frequently killed his generals ; whose 
deaths, were I severally to commemorate, perhaps I should 
not be superfluous, though I might risk the peril of creating 
\ I disgust ; while I should be not easily pardoned as an lusto- 

' ' rian, if I were led astray by the falsities of my authorities. 
Malcolm willingly received all the English fugitives, af- 
fording to each every protection in his power, but more es- 
pecially to Edgar, whose sister he had married, out of regard 
to her noble descent. On his behalf he burnt and plundered 
the adjacent provinces of England ; not that he supposed, by 
so doing, he could be of any service to him, with respect to 
the kingdom ; but merely to distress the mind of William, 
who was incensed at lus territories being subject to Scottish 
incursions. In consequence, William, collecting a body of 
foot and horse, repaired to the northern parts of the island, 
and first of all received into subjection the metropolitan city, 
which English, Danes, and Scots obstinately defended ; its 
citizens being wasted with continued want He destroyed 
also in a great and severe battle, a considerable number of 
the enemy, who had come to the succour of the besieged ;

desolated that they could not pay gold, Sir H. Ellis remarks : " The extra- 
onlinoiy number of houses specified as desolated at Oxford, requires ex- 
planation. If the passage is correct, Matthew Paris probably gi^es us the 
cause of it, under the year 1067, when William the Conqueror ^bdued 
Ojford in his way to York : — ' Eodem tempore rex Willielmus urbem Ox- 
oniam nbi rebellem obsidione vallavit. Super cujus murum quidaooi, stans, 
nudato inguine, sonitu partis inferioris auias turbavit, in contemptum vide- 
licet Kormannorum ; unde Willielmus in iram conversus, civitatem levi 
negotio Bubjugavit.' (Matt P. ed. Watts, sub ann, 1067, p. 4.) The 
siege of Exeter in 1067 is also mentioned by Simeon of Durham, col. 197 :

numy of his people. He then ordered both the towns and 
fields of the whole district to be laid waste ; the fruits and 
grain to be destroyed by fire or by water, more especially on ^ 
the coasti as well on account of his recent displeasure, as be- 
cause a rumour had gone abroad, that Canute, king of Den- 
mark, the son of Sweyn, was approaching with his forces. 
The reason of such a conmiand, was, that the plundering 
pirate should find no booty on the coast to take with him, if ^. 
he designed to depart again directly ; or should be compeUed 
to provide against want, if he thought proper to stay. Thus 
the resources of a province,* once flourishing, and the nurse 
of tyrants, were cut off by fire, slaughter, and devastation ; 
the ground, for more than sixty miles, totally uncultivated 
and unproductive, remains bare to the present day. Should 
any stranger now see it, he laments over the once-magnifi- 
cent cities ; the towers threatening heaven itself with tl^ir 
iGftiness ; the fields abnndant in pasturage, and watered with 
rivers : and, if any ancient inhabitant remains, he knows it 
no lAger. 

Malcolm surrendered himself without coming to an en- 
gagement, and for the whole of William's time passed his 
life imder treaties, uncertain, and frequently broken. But 
when in the reign of William, the son of William, he was 
attacked in a similar manner, he diverted the king firom pur- 
suing him by a false oath. He was slain soon after, together 
with his son, by Robert Mowbray, earl of Northumberland, 
while, regardless of his faith, he was devastating the pro- 
vince with more than usual insolence. For many years, he 
lay buried at Tynemouth : lately he was conveyed by Alex- 
ander his son, to Dunfermlin, in Scotland.

Edgar, having sttbmitted to the king with Stigand and Aldred 
the archbishops, violated his oath the following year, by going 
over to the Scot : but after livingthere some years, and acquiring 
no present advantage, no future prospects, but merely his daily 
sustenance^ being willing to try the Hberality of the Norman, 
who was at that lime beyond the sea, he sailed over to him. 
They say this was extremely agreeable to the king, that Eng- 
land should be thus rid of a fomenter of dissension. Indeed 

was his constant practice, under colour of high honour, to 
carry over to Normandy all the English he suspected, lest 
any disorders should arise in the kingdom during his absence. 
Edgar, therefore, was well received, and presented with a 
considerable laigess : and remaining at court for many years, 
silently sunk into contempt through his indolence, or more 
mildly speaking, his simplicity. For how great must his 
simplidly be, who would yield up. to the king, for a single 
horse, the pound of silver, which Ibie received as his daily sti- 
pend? In succeeding times he went to Jerusalem with 
Robert, the son of Grodwin,* a most valiant knight. This 
was the time when ' the Turks besieged king' Baldwin, at 
Rama ; who, unable to endure the difficulties of a siege, rushed 
through the midst of the enemy, by the assistance of Robert 
alone, who preceded him, and hewed down the Turks, on 
either hand, with his dntwn sword ; but, while excited to 
greater ferocity by his success, he was pressing on with too 
much eagerness, his swinrd dropped fix)m his hand, and when 
stooping down to recover it, he was surrounded by a multi- 
tude, and cast into chains. Taken thence to Babylon, as they 
report, when he refused to deny Christ, he was placed as a 
mark in the middle of the market-place, and being transfixed 
with darts, died a martyr. Edgar, having lost his com- 
panion, returned, and received many gifts from the Greek

FoF, as I have before observed, a few days previous to the 
death of St. Edward the king, the inhabitants of the north 
had risen in rebellion and expelled Tosty, their governor ; 
and, with Harold's approbation, had requested, and received, 
one of these brothers, as their lord. These circumstances, 
as we have heard from persons acquainted with the affair, 
took place against the inclination of the king, who was 
attached to Tosty ; but being languid through disease, and 
worn down with age, he become so universally disregarded, 
that he could not assist his favourite. In consequence, his 
bodily ailments increasing from the anxiety of his mind, he 
died shortly after. Harold persisted in his resolution of 
banishing his brother : wherefore, first tarnishing the 
triumphs of his family by piratical excursions, he was, as I 
have above written, afterwards kiUed with the king of 
Norway. His body being known by a wart betr/tfifift -^be 
shouldera, obtained burial at York. Edwin and Morcar, by 
Harold's command, then conveyed the spoils of war to 
London, for he himself was proceeding rapidly to the battle 
of Hastings ; where, falsely presaging, he looked upon the 
victory as already gained. But, when he was there killed, 
the brothers, flying to the territories they possessed, disturbed 
the peace of William for several years ; infesting the wooda 
with secret robberies, and never coming to close or open 
engagement. Often were they taken captive, and as often 
surrendered themselves, but were again dismissed with 
impunity, from pity to their youthful elegance, or respect to 
their nobility. At last, murdered, neither by the force nor 
craft of their enemies, but by the. treachery of their

partisans, their fate drew tears from the king, who would 
even long since have granted them matches with his 
relations, and the honour of his friendship, would they have 
acceded to terms of peace. 

Waltheof, an earl of high descent, had become extremelj 
intimate with the new king, who had forgotten his former 
offences, and attributed them rather to courage, than to 
disloyalty. For Waltheof, singly, had kiUed many of the 
Normans in the battle of York ; cutting off their heads, one 
by one, as they entered the gate. He was muscular in the 
arms, brawny in the chest, tall and robust in his whole 
person ; the son of Siward, a most celebrated earl, whom, by 
a Danish term, they called '^ Digera," which impHes Strong. 
But after the fall of his party, he voluntarily surrendered 
himself, and was honoured by a marriage with Judith, the 
king's neice, as well as with lus personal friendship. Unable 
however to restrain his evil inclinations, he could not 
preserve his fidelity. For all his countrymen, who had 
thought proper to resist, being either slain, or subdued, he 
became a party even in the perfidy of Ralph de Waher ; but 
the conspiracy being detected,* he was taken ; kept in chains 
for some time, and at last, being beheaded, was buried at 
Croyland : though some assert, that he joined the league of 
treachery, more through circumvention than inclination. 
This is the excuse the English make for him, and those, of 
the gi-eater credit, for the Normans affirm the contrary, to 
whose decision the Divinity itself appears to assent, showing 
many and very great miracles at his tomb : for they declare, 
that during lus captivity, he wiped away his transgressions 
I by his daily penitence. 

I On this account perhaps the conduct of the king may 
j reasonably be excused, if he was at any time rather severe 
r against the English ; for he scarcely found any one of them 
I faithful. This circumstance so exasperated his ferocious 
mind, that he deprived the more powerful, first of their 
wealth, next of their estates, and finally, some of them of 
their lives. Moreover, he followed the device of Ceesar, who 

• <* Earl Wa!theof, or Wallef, as he is always styled in Domesday Book, 
was, according to the Saxon Chronicle, beheaded at Winchester on the 
31st May, 1076. The Chronicle of Mailros and'Florence of Worcester, 
howoTer, assign this event to the preceding year."— Ha&dt.

drove out the Grermans, concealed in the vast forest of 
Ardennes, whence they harassed his army with perpetual 
irmptions, not hy means of his own countrymen, but by the 
confederate Gauls ; that, while strangers destroyed each 
other, he might gain a bloodless victory. Thus, I say, 
William acted towards the English. For, allowing the 
Normans to be unemployed, he opposed an English army, 
and an English commander, to those, who, after the first 
unsuccessful battle, had fled to Denmark and Ireland, and 
had returned at the end of three years with considerable 
force : forseeing that whichever side might conquer, it must 
be a great advantage to himself. Nor did this device fail him ; 
for both parties of the English, after some conflicts between 
themselves^ without any exertion on his part, left a victory 
for the king ; the invaders being driven to Ireland, and the 
royalists purchasing the empty title of conquest, at their own 
special loss, and that of their general. His name was 
Ednoth,* equally celebrated, before the arrival of the 
Normans, both at home and abroad. He was the father of 
Harding, who yet survives : a man more accustomed to 
kindle strife by 'his malignant tongue, than to brandish arms 
in the field of battle. Tlius having overturned the power of 
the Ifuty, he made an ordinance, that no monk, or clergjnoaan, 
of that nation, should be sufiered to aspire to any dignity 
whatever ; excessively differing from the gentleness of 
Canute the former king, who restored their honours, 
unimpaired, to the conquered : whence it came to pass, that 
at his decease, the natives easily expelled the foreigners, and 
reclaimed their original right. But William, from certain 
causes, canonically deposed some persons, and in the place of 
such as might die, appointed diligent men of any nation, 
except English. Unless I am deceived, their inveterate 
frowardness towards the king, required such a measure ; 
.since, as I have said before, the Normans are by nature 
kindly disposed to strangers who live amongst them. 

Halph, whom I mentioned before, was, by the king's gift, 
earl of Norfolk and Suffolk ; a Breton on his father's side ; 
of a disposition foreign to every thing good. This man. in

consequence of being betrothed to the king's relation, the 
daughter of William Fitz-Osbeme, conceived a most ui\jtt8t 
design, and meditated attack on the sovereigntj. Wherefore, 
on the very day of his nuptials, whilst splendidly banquet- 
ing, for the luxury of the English had now been adopted by 
the Normans, and when the guests had become intoxicated 
and heated with wine, he disclosed his intention in a copious 
harangue. As their reason was entirely clouded by drunken- 
ness, tiiey loudly applauded the orator. Here Roger earl of 
Hereford, brother to the wife of Ralph, and here Waltheoi^ 
together with many others, conspired the death of the king. 
Next day, however, when the fumes of the wine had evapo* 
rated, and cooler thoughts influenced the minds of some of 
the party, the larger portion, repenting of their conduct, 
retired from the meeting. Among these is said to have been 
Waltheof, who, at the reconunendation of archbishop Lan- 
franc, sailing to Normandy, related the matter to the king ; 
concealing merely his own share of the business. The earls, 
however, persisted in their design, and each incited his de- 
j^endents to rebel. But Grod opposed them, and brought all 
/ their machinations to nought. For immediately the king's 
\ officers, who were left in charge, on discovering the affair, 
reduced Ralph to such distress, that seizing a vessel at Nor- 
wich, he committed himself to the sea. His wife, covenanting 
for personal safety, and delivering up the castle, followed her 
husband. Roger being thrown into chains by the king, 
visited, or rather inhabited, a prison, during the remainder 
of his life ; a young man of abominable treachery, and by 
no means imitating his father's conduct 

Hb father, indeed, William Fitz-Osbeme,* might have 
been compared, nay, I know not if he might not even have 
been preferred, to the very best princes. By his advice^ 
William had first been inspirited to invade, and next, assisted 
by his valour, to keep possession of England. The eaisrgy 
of his mind was seconded by the almost boundless liberality 
of his hand. Hence it arose, that by the multitude of soldiers, 
to whom he gave extravagant pay, he repelled the rapacity 
of the enemy, and ensured the &vour of the people. In con-

geqaence, by this boundless profusion, be incurred the king's 
severe displeasure ; because he had improvidently exhausted 
his treasures. The regulations which he estabUshed in his 
county of Hereford, remain in full force at the present day ; 
/ that is to say, that no knight* should be fined more than 
^ s even shi llings for whaJcYer offence : whereas, in other pro- 
vinces, for a very small fault in transgressing the commands 
of their lord, they pay twenty or twenty-five. Fortune, 
however, closed these happy successes by a dishonourable 
termination, when the supporter of so great a government, 
the counsellor of England and Normandy, went into Flan- 
ders, through fond regard for a woman, and there died by 
the hands of his enemies. For the elder Baldwin, of whom 
I have before spoken, the father of Matilda, had two sons : 
Robert, who marrying the countess of Frisia, while hip 
father yet lived, took the surname of Friso : Baldwin, who^ 
after his father, presided some years over Flanders, and died 
prematurely. His two children by his wife Richelda surviv- 
ing he had entrusted the guardianship of them to Philip 
king of France, whose aunt was his mother, and to William 
Fitz-Osbeme. William readily undertook this office, that he 
might increase his dignity by an union with Richelda. But 
she, through female pride^ aspiring to things beyond her sex, 
and exacting fresh tributes from the people, excited them to 
rebellion. Wherefore despatching a messenger to Robert 
Friso, they entreat him to accept the government of the 
country ; and abjure all fidelity to Amulph, who was already 
called earL Nor indeed were there wanting persons to 
espouse the party of the minor : so that for a long time, 
Flanders was disturbed by intestine commotion. This, Fitz- 
Osbeme, who was desperately in love with the lady, could 
not endure, but entered Flanders with a body of troops ; 
and, being immediately well received by the persons he came 
to defend, after some days, he rode securely from castle to 
castle, in a hasty manner with few attendants. On the other 
hand, Friso, who was acquainted with this piece of folly, en-

soldier generally ; sometimes it implies a horseman, and frequently it is to 
be taken in its modem acceptation for a knight ; the latter appears to be 
the meaning here.

trapped him unawares bj a secret ambush, and killed him, 
fighting bravely but to no purpose, together with his nephew 
Arnulph. 

Thus possessed of Flanders, he often irritated king TVilliam, 
bj plundering Normandy. His daughter married Canute 
king of the Danes, of whom was bom Charles,* who now 
y rules in Fhmders. He made peace with king Philip, gitibg 
him his daughter-in-law in marriage, by whom he had Lewis, 
who at present reigns in France ; but not long after, being 
heartily tired of the match, because his queen was extremely 
corpulent, he removed her from his bed, and in defiance of 
law and equity, married the wife of the earl of Anjou. 
Robert, safe by his affinity with these princes, encountered 
nothing to distress him during his government ; though Bald- 
win, the brother of Arnulph, who had an earldom in the pro- 
vince of Hainault and in the castle of Valenciennes, by Wil- 
liam's assistance made many attempts for that purpose. 
Three years before his death, when he was now hoary- 
headed, he went to Jerusalem, for the mitigation of his trans- 
gressions. After his return he renounced the world, calmly 
awaiting his dissolution with Christian earnestness. His son 
was that Robert so universally famed in the expedition into 
Asia, which, in our times, Europe undertook against the 
Turks ; but through some mischance, after his return home, 

Che tarnished that noble exploit, bdng mortally wounded in a 
tournament, as they call it. Nor did a happier fate attend 
his son BsJdwin, who, voluntarily harassing the forces of 
Henry king of England, in Normandy, paid dearly for his 
youthful temerity : for, being struck on the head witii a pole, 
and deceived by the professions of several physicians, he lost 
his life ; the princip^ty devolving on Charles, of whom we 
have spoken before. 
' Now, king William conducting himself with mildness 

/towards the obedient but with severity to the rebellious, pos-

leading thither an expedition composed of English ; who, 
though they had been easily conquered in their own, yet 
always appeared invincible in a foreign country. He lo6t 
multitudes of his men at Dol,* a town of Brittany, whither, 
irritated by some broil, he had led a military force. He con- 
stantly found Philip king of France, the daughter of whose 
aunt he had married, unfaithful to him ; because he was en- 
vious of the great glory of a man who was vassal both to hia 
father and to himself. But William did not the less actively 
resist his attempts, although his first-bom son Robert^ 
through evil counsel, assisted him in opposition to his father. 
Whence it happened, that in an attack at Grerborai, the son 
became personally engaged with his father ;. wounded him 
and killed his horse : William, the second son, departed with 
a hurt also, and many of the king's party were slain. In all 
other respects, during the whole of his life, he was so fortu- 
nate, that foreign and distant nations feared nothing more 
than his name. He had subdued the inhabitants so com- 
pletely to his will, that without any opposition, he first caused 
an account to be taken of every person ; compiled a roister 
of the rent of every estate throughout England ;t and made 
all free men, of every description, take the oath of fidelity to 
him. Canute, king of the Danes, who was most highly ele» 
vated both by his affinity to Robert Friso and by his own 
power, alone menaced his dignity ; a rumour being generally 
prevalent, that he would invade England, a country due to 
him from his relationship to the ancient Canute : and indeed 
he would have effected it, had not God counteracted his 
boldness by an unfavourable wind. But this circumstance

292 WILLIAM OF JUULLMSSBUBT. [b. in. 

reminds me briefly to trace the genealogy of the Danish 
kings, who succeeded after our Canute ; adding at the same 
time, somewhat concerning the Norwegians. 

As it has been before observed, Harold succeeded in Eng- 
land ; Hardecanute, and his sons, in Denmark : for Magnus 
the son of Olave, whom I have mentioned in the history of 
our Canute, as having been killed by his subjects, had re- 
covered Norway, which Canute had subdued. Harold dying 
in England, Hardecanute held both kingdoms for a short 
time. On his decease, Edward the Simple succeeded, who, 
satisfied with his paternal kingdom, despised his foreign domi- 
nions as burdensome and barbarous. One Sweyn, doubt- 
lessly a most exalted cliaracter, was then made lung of the 
Danes.* When his government had prospered for several 
years, Magnus, king of the Norwegians, with the consent of 
some of the Danes, expelled him by force, and subjected the 
land to his own will. Sweyn, thus expelled, went to the 
king of Sweden, and collecting, by his assistance, Swedes, 
Yandals, and Goths, he returned, to regain the kingdom: 
but, through the exertions of the Danes, who were attached 
to the government of Magnus, he experi^ced a repetition 
of his former ill-fortune. This was a great and memorable 
battle among those barbarous j^eople : on YL6 other occasion 
did the Danes ever experience Severer conflict, or happier 
success. Indeed, to this very time, they keep unbroken the 
vow, by which they had bound themselves, before the con- 
test, that they would consecrate to future ages the vigil of 
St. Lawrence, for on that day the battle was fought, by fast- 
ing and alms; and then also Sweyn fled, but soon after, on 
the death of Magnus, he received his kingdom entire. 

To Magnus, in Norway, succeeded one Sweyn, surnamed 
Hardhand; not elevated by royal descent, but by boldness 
and cunning : to him Clave, the uncle of Magnus, whom 
they call a saint; to Olave, Harold Harvagre, the brother 
of Olave, who had formerly, when a young man, served 
under the emperor of Constantinople. Being, at his com- 
mand, exposed to a lion, for having debauched a woman of 
quality, he strangled the huge beast by the bare vigour of 
his arms. He was slain in England by Harold, the son of

Godwin. His sons, Olave and Magnus, divided the king- 
dom of their father ; but Magnus dying prematurely, Ohive 
seized the whole. To him succeeded his son Magnus, who 
was lately miserably slain in Ireland, on which he had rashly 
made a descent. They relate, that Magnus, the elder son of 
Harold, was, after the death of his father, compassionately 
sent home by Harold, king of England ; and that in return 
for this kindness, he humanely treated Harold, the son of 
Harold, when he came to him after William's victory : tha 
he took him with him, in an expedition he made to England, 
in the time of William the younger, when he conquered the 
Orkney and Mevanian Isles,* and meeting with Hugo, earl 
of Chester, and Hugo, earl of Shrewsbury, put the first to 
flight, and the second to death. The sons of the last Mag- 
nus, Hasten and Siward, yet reign conjointly, having divideid 
the empire : the latter, a seemly and spirited yout^ shortly 
since went to Jerusalem, passing through England, and per- 
formed many famous exploits against the Saracens; more 
especially in the siege of Sidon, whose inhabitants raged 
ftiriously against the Christians through their connection 
with the Turks. 

But Sweyn, as I have related, on his restorktion to the 
sovereignty of the Danes, being impatient of quiet, sent his 
son Canute twice into England; first with three hundred, 
and then with two hundred, ships. His associate in the 
former expedition was Osbem, the brother of Sweyn ; in 
the latter, Hacco : but, being each of them bribed, they frus- 
trated the young man's designs, and returned home without 
effecting their purpose. In consequence, becoming highly 
disgraced by king Sweyn for bartering their fidelity for 
money, they were driven into banishment. Sweyn, when 
near his end, bound all the inhabitants by oath, that, as he 
had fourteen sons, they should confer the kingdom on each 
of them in succession, as long as his issue remained. On 
his decease, his son Harold succeeded for three years : to 
him Canute, whom his father had formerly sent into Eng- 
land. Bemembering his original failure, he prepared, as we 
have beard, more than a thousand vessels against England : 
his father-in-law, Robert Friso, the possessor of six hundred 
more, supporting him. But being detained, for almost two

jearSf bj the adverseness of the wind, he changed his de- 
sign, affirming, that it must be bj the determination of Grod» 
that he could not put to sea : but afterwards, misled bj the 
suggestions of some persons, who attributed the failure of 
their passage to the conjurations of certain old women, he 
sentenced the chiefs, whose wives were accused of this trans- 
gression, to an intolerable fine ; cast his brother, Olave, the 
principal of the suspected faction into chains, and sent him 
into exile to his father-in-law. The barbarians, in conse- 
^ quenc^ resenting this attack upon their libertj, killed him 
/ while in church, clinging to the altar, and promising repara- 
^tion. They say that many miracles were shown from heaven 
at that place; because he was a man strictly observant of 
fasting and almsgiving, and pursued the transgressors of the 
divine laws more rigorously than those who offended against 
himself; from which circumstance, he was consecrated a 
martyr by the pope of Rome. After him, the murderers^ 
that they might atone for their crime by some degree of 
good, redeemed Olave from captivity, for ten thousand 
marks. After ignobly reigning during eight years, he left 
the government to his brother Henry : who living virtuously 
for twenty-nine years, went to Jerusalem, and breathed his 
last at sea. Nicholas, the fifth in the sovereignty, still 
survives.* 

The king of Denmark then, as I have said, was the only 

(obstacle to William's uninterrupted enjoyment : on whose 
account he enlisted such an immense multitude of stipen- 
diary soldiers out of every province on this side the moun- 
tains, that their numbers oppressed the kingdom. But he, 
with his usual magnaminity, not r^arding the expense^ 
had engaged even Hugo the Great, brother to the king of 
. France, with his bands to serve in Lis army. He was ac- 
customed to stimulate and incite his own valour, by the 
remembrance of Robert Guiscard ; saying it was disgraceful 
. to yield, in courage, to him whom he surpassed in rank. 
For Robert, bom of middling parentage in Normandy, that 
is, neither very low nor very high, had gone, a few years 
before William's arrival in England, with fifteen knights, 
into Apulia, to remedy the narrowness of his own circum-

stancefly by entering into the service of that inaetave raee of 
people. Not manj years elapsed, ere, by the stupendous 
assistance of God, he reduced the whole country under his 
power. For where his strength failed, his ingenuity wao 
alert : first receiving the towns, and after, the cities into 
confederacy with him. Thus he became so successful, as 
to make himself duke of Apulia and Calabria ; his brother ^ 
Richard, prince of Capua; and his other brother, Roger, 
earl of Sicily. At last, giving Apulia to his son Roger, he 
crossed the Adriatic with his other son Boamund, and taking 
Durazzo, was immediately proceeding against Alexius, em- 
peror of Constantinople, when a messenger from pope Hilde- 
brand stopped him in the heat of his career. For Henry, 
emperor of Germany, son of that Henry we have before 
mentioned, being incensed against the pope, for having ex- 
communicated him on account of the ecclesiastical investi- 
tures, led an army against Rome; besieged it; expelled 
Hildebrand, and introduced Guibert of Ravenna. Guiscard 
learning this by the letter of the expelled pope, left his son 
Boamund, with the army, to follow up his designs, and 
returned to Apulia; where quickly getting together a body 
of Apulians and Normans, he proceeded to Rome. Nor did 
Henry wut for a messenger to announce his approach ; bul^ 
affrighted at the bare report, fled with his pretended pope. 
Rome, freed from intruders, received its lawful sovereign; 
but soon after again lost him by similar violence. Then too, 
Alexius, learning that Robert was called home by the ur- 
gency of his affairs, and hoping to put a finishing hand to 
the war, rushed against Boamund, who commanded the 
troops which had been left The Norman youth, however, 
obeervant of his native spirit, though far inferior in number, 
turned to flight, by dint of military skill, the undisciplined 
Greeks and the other collected nations. At the same time, 
too, the Venetians, a people habituated to the sea, attacking 
Guiscard, who having settled the object of his voyage was 
now sailing back, met with a similar calamity: part were . 
drowned or killed, the rest put to flight. He, continuing 
his intended expedition, induced many cities, subject to 
Alexius, to second his views. The emperor took ofi^ by 
crime, the man he was unable to subdue by arms: falsely 
promising his wife an imperial match. By her artifices, he

drank poison,* which she had prepared, and died ; deserving^ 
had God so pleased, a nobler death: for he was unconquer- 
able by the sword of an enemy, but fell a victim to domestic 
treachery. He was buried at Venusium in Apulia, having 
the following epitaph :

And since mention has been made of Hildebrand, I shall 
late some anecdotes of him, which I have not heard triviallyy 
but from the sober relation of a person who would swear 
/ that he had learned them from the mouth of Hugo abbat of 
Clugny ; whom I admire and conmiend to notice, from the 
consideration, that he used to declare the secret thoughts of 
others by the prophetic intuition of his mind. Pope Alex- 
ander, seeing the energetic bent of his disposition, had made 
him chancellor f of the holy see. In consequence, by virtue 
of his office, he used to go through the provinces to correct 
abuses. AU ranks of people flocked to him, requiring judg- 
ment on various affairs; all secular power was subject to 
him, as well out of regard io his sanctity as his office. 
Whence it happened, one day, when there was a greater con> 
course on horseback than usual, that the abbat aforesaid, 
with his monks,' was gently proceeding in the last rank ; and 
beholding at a distance the distinguished honour of this 
man, that so many earthly rulers awaited his nod, he "was 
revolving in his mind sentiments to the following effect: 
" By what dispensation t>f Grod was this fellow, of diminu- 
tive stature and obscure parentage, surrounded by a retinue 
of so many rich men ? Doubtless, from having such a crowd 
of attendants, he was vain^glorious, and conceived loftier no- 
tions than were becoming." Scarcely, as I have said, had 
he imagined this in his heart, when the archdeacon, turning 
back his horse, and spurring him, cried out from a distance, 
beckoning the abbat, " You," said he, " you have imagined 
falsely, wrongly deeming me guilty of a thing of which I am 
innocent altogether ; for I neither impute this as glory to

myself if glory that can be called which vanishes quickly, 
nor do I wish it to be so imputed by others, but to the 
blessed apostles, to whose servant it is exhibited." Redden- 
ing with shame, and not daring to deny a tittle, he replied 
only, " My lord, I pray thee, how couldst thou know the 
secret thought of my heart which I have communicated to 
no one ?" '^ All that inward sentiment of yours," said he, 
** was brought from your mouth to my ears, as though by 
a pipe," 

Again, entering a country church, in the same province, 
they prostrated themselves before the altar, side by side. 
When they had continued their supplications for a long 
period, the archdeacon looked on the abbat with an angry 
countenance. After they had prayed some time longer, he 
went out, and asking the reason of his displeasure, received 
this answer, ^* If you love me, do not again attack me with 
an injury of this kind ; my Lord Jesus Christ, beautiful 
beyond the sons of men, was visibly present to my entreaties, 
listening to what I said and kindly looking assent ; but, at- 
tracted by the earnestness of your prayer, he left me and 
turned to you. I think you will not deny it to be a species 
of injury to take from a friend the author of his salvation. 
Moreover, you are to know that mortality of mankind and 
destruction hang over this place ; and the token by which I 
formed such a conclusion was my seeing the angel of the 
Lord standing upon the altar with a naked sword, and wav- 
ing it to and fro : I possess a more manifest proof of the 
impending ruin, from tilie thick, cloudy air which, as you see, 
already envelopes that province. Let us make haste to 
escape, then, lest we perish with the rest" Having said 
this, they entered an inn for refreshment ; but, as soon as 
food was placed before them, the lamentations of the house- 
hold took away their famished appetites : for first one, and 
then another, and presently many of the family suddenly 
lost their lives by some unseen disaster. The contagion 
then spreading to the adjoining houses, they mounted their 
mules, and departed, fear adding wings to their flight. 

Hildebrand had presided for the pope at a council in Gaul, 
where many bishops being degraded, for having formerly 
acquired their churches by simony, gave place to better men. 
Tbere was one, to whom a suspicion of this apostacy at- 



296 WaZJAU 09 UAIMESBUKT, B.m 

tached, bnt he oonld neither be convicted by any witnesses, 
nor confuted by any argument. When it was supposed he 
must be completely foiled, still like the slippery snake he 
eluded detection ; so skilled was he in speaking, that he baf- 
fled all. Then said the archdeacon, ^ Ijet the oracle of God 
be resorted to, let man's eloquence cease ; we know for certain 
that episcopal grace is the gift of the Holy Spirit^ and that 
whosoever purchases a bishopric, supposes the gift of the 
Holy Ghost may be procured by money. Before you then, 
who are assembled by the will of the Holy Ghost, let him 
say, * Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the 
Holy Ghost,' and if he shall speak it articulately, and with- 
out hesitation, it will be manifest to me that he has obtained 
his office, not by purchase, but legally .'^ He willingly ac- 
cepted the condition, supposing nothing less than any diffi- 
culty in these words; and indeed he perfectly uttered, 
" Glory be to the Father, and to the Son," but he hesitated 
at the " Holy Ghost." A clamour arose on all sides, but he 
was never able, by any exertion, either at that time or for 
the remainder of his life, to name the Holy Spirit. The 
abbat so often mentioned was a witness of this miracle ; who 
taking the deprived bishop with him into different places, 
often laughed at the issue of the experiment Any person 
doubting the certainty of this relation, must be confuted by 
all Europe, which is aware that the numbers of the Clugniac 
order were incresjsed by this abbat. 

On the death of Alexander, therefore, Hildebrand, called 
Gregory the Seventh, succeeded.* He openly asserted what 
others had whispered, excommunicating those persons who^ 
having been elected, should receive the investiture f of their 
churches, by the ring and staff, through the hands of the 
laity. On this account Henry, emperor of Germany, being 
incensed that he should so far presume without his concur- 
rence, expelled him from Rome, as I observed, after the ex- 
piration of eleven years, and brought in Guibert. Not long 
after, the pope, being seized with that fatal disease which he 
had no doubt would be mortal, was requested by the cardinals 

* He waa elected pope the 22Dd of April, 1073, and died 25tli May, 
1085.— Haiidt. 

t Investiture was a symbolical mode of receiving poMeanon of a bake- 
ffoa^ dignity, or office.

to appoint Ids successor ; referring him to the example of St. 
Peter, who, in the church's earliest infancy, had, while jet 
living, nominated Clement He refused to follow this ex- 
ample, because it had anciently been forbidden by councils : 
be would advise, however, that if they wished a person power* 
ful in worldly matters, they should choose Desiderius . abbat 
of Cassino, who would quell the violence of TStiibert success- 
fully and opportunely by a military force ; but if they wanted a 
religious and eloquent man, they should elect Odo b ishop of Os- 
tia. Thus died a man, highly acceptable to God, though perhaps 
rather too austere towards men. Indeed it is affirmed, that in 
the beginning of the first commotion between him and the em- 
peror, he would not admit him within his doors, though bare- 
footed, and carrying shears* and scourges, despising a man 
guilty of sacrilege, and of incest with his own sister. The 
emperor, thus excluded, departed, vowing that this repulse 
should be the death of many a man. And immediately do- 
ing all the iqjury he was able to the Roman see, he excited 
thereby the &vourers of the pope, on every side, to throw off 
their dlegiance to himself; for one Bodulph, revolting at the 
eonmiand of the pope, who had sent him a crown in the 
name of the apostles, he was immersed on all sides in the 
tumult of war. But Henry, ever superior to ill fortune, at 
length subdued him and all others faithlessly rebelling. At 
last, driven from his power, not by a foreign attack, but the 
domestic hatred of his son, he died miserably. To Hilde- 
brand succeeded Desiderius, called Victor, who at his first 
mass fell down dead, though from what mischance is un- 
known ; the cup, if -it be possible to credit such a thing, be* 
ing poisoned. The election then fell upon Odo, a French- 
man by birth, first archdeacon of Rheims, then prior of 
Clugny, afterwards bishop of Ostia, lastly pope by the name 
of Urban. 

Thus fiur I shall be pardoned, for having digressed, as 
from the mention of William's transactions, scone things 
occurred which I thought it improper to omit: now, the

reader, who is so inclined, shall learn the more common 
\ habits of his life, and his domestic manners. Above all 
then, he was humble to the servants of God ; affable to the 
obedient ; inexorable to the rebellious. He attended the 
l, offices of the Christian religion, as much as a secular was 
able ; so that he daily was present at mass, and heard 
vespers and matins. He built one monastery in England, 
and another in Normandy ; that at Caen * first, which he 
dedicated to St Stephen, and endowed with suitable estates, 
.. and most magnificent presents. Plliere he appointed Lan- 
franc, afterwards archbishop of Canterbury, abbat : a man 
worthy to be compared to the ancients, in knowledge, and in 
religion : of whom it may be truly said, *^ Cato the third is 
descended from heaven ; " so much had an heavenly savour 
tinctured his heart and tongue ; so much was the whole 
"^ Western world excited to the knowledge of the liberal arts, 
by his learning ; and so earnestly did the monastic profession 
labour in the work of religion, either from his example, or 
authority. No sinister means profited a bishop in those 
days ; nor could an abbat procure advancement by purchase. 
He who had the best report for undeviating sanctity, was 
most honoured, and most esteemed both by the king and bj 
the archbishop.^ William built another monastery near 
Hastings, dedicated to St. Martin, which was also called 
Battle, because there the principal church stands on the very 
spot, where, as they report, Harold was found in the thickest 
heaps of the slain. When little more than a boy, yet gifted 
with the wisdom of age, he removed his uncle Malger, from 
the archbishopric of Bouen. He was a* man not ordinarily 
learned, but, through his high rank, forgetful of his pro- 
fession, he gave too much attention to hunting and hawking ; 
and consumed the treasures of the church in riotous living. 
The fame of this getting abroad, he never, during his whole 
life-time, obtained the pall, because the holy see refused the 
distinction of that honour, to a man who neglected his 
sacred office. Wherefore being frequently cited, his nephevr

however, a foundation charter granted Buhsequently to 1066, for in it

reprehending his offences, and still conducting himself in 
the same manner, he was, from the urgency of the case, 
ultimately degraded. Some report that there was a secret 
reason for his heing deprived : that Matilda, whom William 
had married, was very nearly related to him : that Malger, 
in consequence, through zeal for the Christian faith, could 
not endure that they should riot in the bed of consanguinity ; 
and that he hurled the weapon of excommunication against 
his nephew, and his consort : that, when the anger of the ^ 
young man was roused by the complaints of his wife, an , 
occasion was sought out, through which the persecutor of 
thdr crime might be driven from his see : but that 
afterwards, in riper years, for the expiation of their offence, 
he built the monastery to St Stephen at Caen ; and she also 
one, in the same town, to the Holy Trinity ; • each of them 
choosing the inmates according to their own sex. 

To Malger succeeded Maurilius of Feschamp ; a monk 
commendable for many virtues, but principally for his 
abstinence. After a holy and well-spent hfe, when he 
came, by the call of God, to his end, bereft of vital breath, 
he lay, as it were, dead for almost half a day. Nevertheless, 
when preparation was made to carry him into the church, / 

recovering his breath, he bathed the by-standers in tears of / 

joy, and comforted them, when lost in amazement, with this '^^ 
address : '^ Let your minds be attentive while you hear the 
last words of your pastor. I have died a natural death, but ^ 
I am come back, to relate to you what I have seen ; yet shall 
I not continue with you long, because it delights me to sleep 
in the Lord. The conductors of my spirit were adorned with 
every elegance both of countenance and attire ; the gentleness 
of their speech accorded with the splendour of their garments; 
so much so, that I could wish for nothing more than the 
attentions of such men. Delighted therefore with their 
soothing approbation, I went, as it appeared to me, towards 
the east. A seat in paradise was promised me, which I was 
shortly to enter. Li a moment, passing over Europe and

entenng Ana, we came to Jerusalem ; where, 

worshipped the saints, we proceeded to Jordan. The 

residents on the hither bank joining company with mj 

condnctors, made a jojful party. I was now hastening to pass 

over the river, through longing desire to see what was 

beyond it, when my companions informed me, that Grod had 

commanded, that I must first be terrified by the sight of the 

demons ; in order that the venial sins, which I had not 

vnped out by confession, might be expiated, by the dread of 

tenific forms. As soon as this was said, there came opposite 

to me, such a multitude of devils, brandishing pointed 

weapons, and breathing out fire, that the plain appeared like 

stee^ and the air like flame. I was so dreadfully alarmed at 

them, that had the earth clave asunder, or the heaven 

opened, I should not have known whither to have betaken 

myself for safety. Thus panic-struck, and doubting whither 

to go, I suddenly recovered my life, though instantaneously 

about to lose it again, that by this relation I might be 

serviceable to your salvation, unless you n^lect it:" and 

almost as soon as he had so said, he breathed out his souL 

His body, then buried under ground, in the church of St^ 

Mary, is now, by divine miracle, as they report, raised up 

more than three feet above the earth. 

ih Moreover, William, following up the design he had 

/Ty formerly begun in Normandy, permitted Stigand, the 

pretended and false archbishop, to be deposed by the Roman 

cardinals and by Ermenfred bishop of Sion. Walkelin 

succeeded him at Winchester, whose good works, surpassing 

fame, will resist the power of oblivion, as long as the 

episcopal see shall there continue : in Kent succeeded 

Lanfranc, of whom I have before spoken, who was, by the 

gift of G<)d, as resplendent in England, 

As Lucifer, who bids the stars retire, 
Day's rosy harbingei with purple fire ; 

SO much did the monastic germ sprout by his care^ so 
strongly grew the pontifical power while he survived. The 
king was observant of his advice in such ^se, that he 
. deemed it proper to concede whatever Lanfranc asserted 
\ ought to be done. At his instigation also was abolished the 
infamous custom of those ill-disposed people who used to sell 
their slaves into Ireland. The credit of this action, I know

not exactly whether to attribute to Lanfranc, or to Wnlstan 
bishop of Worcester ; who would scarcelj have induced the 
king, reluctant from the profit it produced him, to this 
measure, had not Lanfranc commended it, and Wulstan, 
powerful from his sanctity of character, commanded it bj 
episcopal authority : Wuktan, than whom none could be -- 
more just ; nor coidd any in our time equal him in the power 
of miracles, or the gift of prophecy : of which I propose 
hereafter to relate some particulars, should it meet his most 
holy approbation. 

But since the die of fortune is subject to uncertain casts, 
many adverse circumstances happened during those times. 
There was a disgraceful contention* between the abbat of 
Glastonbury and his monks ; so that after altercation they 
came to blows. The monks being driven into the churc^ 
bewailed their miseries at the holy altar. The soldiers, rush- 
ing in, slew two of them, wounded fourteen, and drove away 
the rest Nay the rage of the military had even bristled 
the crucifix with arrows. The abbat, rendered infamous by 
such a criminal outrage, was driven into exile during the 
whole of the king's life ; but, upon his decease, he was re- 
stored to his honours, a sum of money being paid to such as 
interceded for him, for the expiation of his transgression. 

Again, a cruel and ignominious end overtook Walker | ' 
bishop of Durham, whom the Northumbrians, a people ever ' 
ripe for rebellion, throwing off all respect for his holy orders, 
put to death, after having severely insulted him. A consi- 
derable number of Lorrainers were killed there also, for the 
bishop was of that country. The cause of the murder was 
this. The bishop, independently of his see, was warder f of 
the whole county : over public business he had set his rela- 
tion Gilbert, and over domestic, the canon Leobin ; both men 
of diligence in their respective employments, but rash. The 
bishop endured their want of moderation in this respect, out 
of r^ard to their activity ; and, as he had placed them in office, 

* " This diflgraceful contention happened in the year 1083. Itseemi to 
have aiiaen firom the abbat (Thuntan) attempting to introduce a new chant, 
brought (torn Feschamp, instead of the Gregonan^ to which the monks had 
been accustomed." — Hardy. 

f Bracton says (lib. ii. c 8, sec. 4), that the bishop of Durham had as 
full power in the county of Durham as the kjig in his own palace. The 
privileges of ^the see of Durham trnce back to the time of St. Cuthbert.

treated them with great kindness. ''For our nature ever 
indulges itself, and favourably regards its own kind works." 
This Leobin caused Liwulph, a servant so dearly beloved by 
St. Cuthbert that the saint himself used to appear to him, 
even when waking, and prescribe his decisions ; him, I say, 
he caused to be kOled by Gilbert ; smitten with envy at his 
holding the higher place in the prelate's esteem for his know- 
ledge and equity in legal determinations. Walker, terrified 
with this intelligence, offered the furious family of the de- 
ceased the result of a legal inquiry,* afiirming that Leobin 
would be the cause of his death and of that of his friends. 
When the matter came to a trial, this ferocious race of peo- 
ple were not to be soothed by reasons of any kind ; on the 
contrary, they threw the whole blame on the bishop, because 
they had seen both the murderers familiarly entertained in 
his court after the death of Liwulph. Hence arose clamour 
and indignation, and Gilbert, as he was of his own accord, 
going out of the church, where he had been sitting with the 
bishop, that he mighty at his personal peril, save the life of 
his master, was impiously skin. The bishop, while making 
overtures of peace before the gates, next glutted the rage of 
the people with his blood ; the fomenter of the crime, too, 
Leobin, was half-burnt, as he would not quit the church till 
it was set on fire, and when he rushed out he was received 
on a thousand spears. This had been predicted by Edgitha, 
relict of king Edward; for when she had formerly seen 
Walker, with his milk-white hair, rosy countenance, and ex- 
traordinary stature, conducted to Winchester to be conse- 
crated ; " We have here," said she, ** a noble martyr :** being 
led to form such a presage by reflecting on the muti- 
nous disposition of that people. To him succeeded William, 
abbat of St. Carilef, who established monks at Durham. 

Moreover, the year before the king's death, there was a 
mortality both among men and cattle, and severe tempests, 
accompanied with such thunder and lightning, as no person 
before had ever seen or heard. And in the year he died, a 
contagious fever destroyed more than half the people; in- 
deed the attack of the disease killed many, and then, from 
the unseasonableness of the weather, a famine following, it

spread uniyersaUj and cut off those whom the fever had 
spared. 

In addition to his other virtues he, more e^pe^^ljin e^lj \ ^ 
youth, was observant of chastity ; insomuch that it was very 1 - 
commonly reported that he was impotent Marrying, how- , 
ever, at the recommendation of the nobility, he conducted 
himself, during many years, in such wise, as never to be sus- 
pected of any criminal intercourse. He had many children 
by Matilda, whose obedience to her husband and fruitfulness 
in children excited in his mind the tenderest r^ard for her^ 
although there are not wanting persons who prate about his 
having renounced his former chastity ; and that, after he had 
acceded to the royal dignity, he was connected with the 
daughter of a certain priest, whom the queen caused to be 
removed, by being hamstrung by one of her servants ; on 
which account he was exiled, and Matilda was scourged to 
death with a bridle. But I esteem it folly to believe this of > 
so great a king ; though I decidedly assert that a slight dis- I 
agreement arose between them, in latter times, on account of 1 
their son Bobert, whom his mother was said to supply with ' 
a military force out of her revenues. Neverthdiess, he 
proved that his conjugal affecti<Hi was not in the least dimi- 
nished by this circumstance, as he buried her with great 
magnificence, on her death, four years before his own ; and 
weeping most profusely for many days showed how keenly 
he felt her loss : moreover, from that time, if we give credit 
to report, he refrained from every gratification. The queen* 
was buried at Caen, in the monastery of the Holy Trinity. 
The same proof of regard was evident in the care he took 
of the funeral of queen Edgitha ; who, placed by his atten- 
tion near her husband at Westminster, has a tomb richly 
wrought with gold and silver. 

His sons were Robert, Richard, William, and Henry. I 
Xhe two last reigned after him successively in England : 
JE^bert, irritated that Normandy was refused him during his 
father^s life-time, went indignantly to Italy, that by marry-

assistance in those parts, to oppose the king : bat fiuling of 
this connexion, he excited Philip king of Fhwce against his 
father. Wherefore, disappointed of his paternal blessing 
and inheritance, at his death, he missed England, retaining 
with difficulty the duchy of Normandj : and pawning even 
this, at the expiration, of nine years, to his brother William, 
he joined the expedition into Asia, with the other Christians. 
From thence, at the end of four years, he returned with 
credit for his military exploits ; and without difficulty sat 
himself down in Normandy, because his brother William be- 
ing recently dead, king Henry, unsettled on account of hb 
fresh-acquired power, deemed it enough to retain England 
under his command : but as I must sp^Jc of this in another 
place, I will here pursue the relation I had begun oonoerning 
the sons of Williiun the Great. 

Richard affi>rded his noble father hopes of his future 
g^reatness ; a fine youth and of aspiring disposition, consider- 
ing his age : but an imtimely death quickly withered the bud 
of this promising flower. They relate that while hunting 
deer in the New-forest, he contracted a disorder from a 
stream of infected air. This is the place which William his 
&ther, desolating the towns and destroying the churches for 
more than thirty miles, had appropriated for the nurture and 
refuge of wild beasts;* a di^adful spectacle, indeed, that 
where before had existed human intercourse and the worship 
of God, there deer, and goats, and other animals of that 
kind, should now range unrestrained, and these not subjected 
to the general service of mankind. Hence it b tmly 
asserted that, in this very forest^ William his son, and Im 
grandson Richard, son of Robert, earl of Normandy, bj the 
severe judgment of Gk)d, met their deaths, one by a wound 
in the breast by an arrow, the other by a wound in the neck, 
or as some say, from being suspended by the jaws on the 
branch of a tree, as his horse passed beneath it. 

His daughters were five; first, Cecilia, abbess of Ca«3» 
who still survives : the second, Constantia, married to Alaa

Fei^ant, earl of Brittanj, excited the inliabitantSy by the 
severitj of her justice, to administer a poisonous potion to 
her: the third, Adek, the wife of Stephen, earl of Blois, a 
lady celebrated for secular industry, lately took the veil at 
Mfurdgny. The names of the two others have escaped me.* \ 
One of these, as we have said, was betrothed to Harold, and 
died ere she was marriageable : the other was affianced, by 
messengers, to Alphonso, king of Gallicia, but obtained, 
from God, a yirgin death. A hard substance, which proved 
the frequency of her prayers, was found upon her knees afler | 
her decease. 

Honouring the memory of his father, by every practicable 
method, in the latter part of his life, he caused his bones, 
formerly interred at Nicea, to be taken up by means of a 
person sent for that purpose, in order to convey them else- 
where; who, successfuUy returning, stopped in Apulia, on 
hearing of the death of William, and there buried this illus- 
trious man's remains. He treated his mother, who, before 
the death of his father, had married one Herlewin de Conte- 
ville, a man of moderate wealth, with singular indulgence 
as long as she lived. William's brothers, by this match, 
were Robert, a man of hciavy, sluggish disposition, whom he 
made eail of Moreton ; and Odo, whom, while he was earl, 
he made bishop of Bayeux ; and when king, created him earl 
of Kent Being of quicker talents than the other, he was 
gorenMNT of aU EngWd, under the king, after the death of 
Williaai Fitz-Osbeme. He had wonderful skill in accumu- 
ladng treasure; possessed extreme craft in dissembling: so 
t)Mi% though absent, yet, stuffing the scrips of the pilgrims 
with letters and money, he had nearly purchased the Roman 
papacy from the citizens. But when, through the rumour of 
his intended journey, soldiers eagerly flocked to him from aU 
parts of the kingdom, the king, taking offisnce, threw him 
into eoofi&ement ; saying, that he did not seize the bishop of 
Bayeux, but the earl of Kent His partisans being intimi- 
dUited by threats, discovered such quantities of gold, that the 
heap of precious metal would surpass the belief of the present 
afe ; and, at last^ many sackfuls of wrought gold were also 
o«t of the rivers, which he had secretly buried in cer-

tain places. When released, at the death of his brother, he 
joined Robertas party, as he was averse to his nephew 
William : but then too matters turning out unfavourably, he 
was banished England, and went over to his nephew and his 
bishopric in Normandy. Afteiwards, proceeding with him 
on his enterprize to Jerusalem, he died at Antioch while it 
was besieged by the Christians. 

King William kindly admitted foreigners to his friend- 
ship; bestowed honours on them without distinction, and 
was attentive to almsgiving; he gave many possessions in 
England to foreign churches, and scarcely did his own 
munificence, or that of his nobility, leave any monastery un- 
noticed, more especially in Normandy, so that their poverty 
. J was mitigated by the riches of England. Thus, in his time, 
y ' ,/ the monastic flock increased on every side ; monasteries 
arose, ancient in their rule, but modern in building: but 
here I perceive the muttering of those who say, it would 
have been better that the old should have been preserved in 
their original state, than that new ones should have been 
erected from their plunder. 

X He was of just stature, extraordinary corpulence, fierce 

« countenance; his forehead bare of hair: of such great 

strength of arm, that it was often matter of surprise, that no 

^ ne was able to draw his bow, which himself could bend 

when his horse was on full gallop : he was majestic, whether 
sitting or standing, although the protuberance of his belly 
deformed his royal person: of excellent health, so that he 
was never confined with any dangerous disorder, except at 
the last: so given to the pleasures of the chase, that, as 1 
have before said, ejecting the inhabitants, he let a space of 
many miles grow desolate, that, when at liberty from other 
avocations, he might there pursue his pleasures. He gave 
sumptuous and splendid entertainments, at the principal 
festivals; passing, during the years he could conveniently 
remain in England, Christmas at Gloucester; Easter at 
Winchester; Pentecost at Westminster. At these times a 
royal edict summoned thither all the principal persons of 
every order, that the ambassadors from foreign nations fliight 
admire the splendour of the assemblage, and the oostlinees 
of the banquets. Nor was he at any time more afikble or 
indulgent; in order that the visitants might proclaim uni*

His anxiety for money is the only thing for which he can V ^ 
deservedly be blamed.* This he sought all opportunities of ^ 
scraping together, he cared not how ; he would say and do

the country of money, with which he might retard or repel 
their attacks; very often, as it happens in human affairs, 
where strength failed, purchasing the forbearance of his ene- 
mies with gold. This disgraceful calamity is still prevalent, 
and every day increases; so that both towns and churches 
are subjected to contributions: nor is this done with firm- 
kept faith on the part of the imposers, but whoever offers 
more, carries the prize; all former agreements being disre- 
garded. 

Residing in his latter days in Normandy, when enmity 
had arisen between him and the king of France, he, for a 
short period, was confined to the house: Philip, scoffing at 
this forbearance, is reported to have said, " The king of 
England is lying-in at Rouen, and keeps his bed, like a 
woman after her delivery ;" jesting on his belly, which he 
had been reducing by medicine. Cruelly hurt at this sax- ^ 
casm, he replied, " When I go to mass, after my confine- 
ment, I will make him an offering of a hundred thousand 
candles." t He swore this, '^ by the Resurrection and Glory 
of Grod :" for he was wont purposely to swear such oaths as, 
by the very form of his mouth, would strike terror into the 
minds of his hearers.

310 WILLIAJC OF KAUCESBUBT. [■. m. 

Not long afler, in the end of the month of Augnst, when 
the com was ripe on the ground, the clusters on the vines, 
and the orchards laden with fruit in full abundance, collect- 
ing an armj, he entered France in a hostile manner, tramp- 
ling down, and laying every thing waste : nothing could 
assuage his irritated mind, so determined was he to revenge 
this injurious taunt at the expense of multitudes. At last 
he set fire to the city of Mantes, where the church of St 
Mary was bumt^ together with a recluse who did not think 
it justifiable to quit her cell even under such an emergency ; 
and the whole property of the citizens was destroyed. Ex- 
hilarated by tlus success, while furiously commanding his 
people to add fuel to the conflagration, he approached too 
near the flames, and contracted a disorder from the violence 
of the fire and the intenseness of the autumnal heat. Some 
say, that his horse leaping over a dangerous ditch, ruptured 
his rider, where his belly projected over the front <^ the 
saddle. Injured by this accident, he sounded a retreat, and 
returning to Rouen, as the malady increased he took to his 
bed. His phjrsidans, when consulted, affirmed, from an in- 
spection of his urine, that death was inevitable. On hearing 
this, he filled the house with his lamentations, because death 
had suddenly seized him, before he could effect that reforma- 
tion of life which he had long since meditated. Recovering 
his fortitude, however, he performed the duties of a Christiaa 
in confession and receiving the communion. Reluctantly, 
and by compulsion, he bestowed Normandy on Robert ; to 
William he gave England ; while Henry received his mater- 
nal possessions. He ordered all his prisoners to be released 
and pardoned : his treasures to be brought forth, and dis- 
tributed to the churches : ho gave also a certain sum of 
money to repair the church which had been burnt. Thus 
rightly ordering aU things, he departed on the eighth oi the 
ides of September, [Sept. 6,] in the fifty-ninth year of his 
age : the twenty-second of liis reign : the fifty-second of his 
duchy : and in the year of our Lord 1087. This was the 
same year, in which Canute, king of Denmark, as we have 
before related, was killed ; and in which the Spanish Sara- 
cens raging against the Christians, were shortly compelled 
to retire to their own territories by Alphonso^ king of Gral- 
licia ; unwillingly evacuating even the cities they had for- 
merly occupied.

The bodj, enbalmed after royal castom, was brought down 
the river Seine to Caen, and tKere consigned to the earth, a 
large assembly of the clergy attending, but few of the laity. 
Here might be seen the wretchedness of earthly vicissitude ; 
for that man who was formerly the glory of all Europe, and more 
powerful than any of his predecessors, could not find a place 
of everlasting rest, without contention. For a certain knight, 
to whose patrimony the place pertained, loudly exclaiming at 
the robbeiy, forbade his burial ; saying, that the ground be- 
longed to himself by paternal right ; and that the king had 
no claim to rest in a place which he had forcibly invaded. 
Whereupon, at the desire of Henry, the only one of his sons 
who was present, a hundred pounds of silver* were paid to 
this brawler, and quieted his audacious claim : for at that 
time, Robert his elder bom was in France, carrying onjt 
war against his own country : William had sailed for Eng- 
land, ere the king had well breathed his last ; thinking it 
more advantageous to look to his future benefit, than to be 
present at the funeral of his father. Moreover, in the disper- 
sion of money, neither slow, nor sparing, he brought forth from 
its secret hoard, all that treasure which had been accumulated 
at Winchester, during a reign of so many years : to the 
monasteries he gave a piece of gold ; to each parish church 
itve slullings in silver : to every county a hundred pounds 
to be divided to each poor man sevendly. He also very i 
splendidly adorned the tomb of his father, with a large mass I 
of gold and silver and the refulgence of precious stones. 

At this time lived Berengar, the heresiarch of Tours, who 
denied, that the bread and wine, when placed on the altar 
and consecrated by the priest, were, as the holy church 
affirms, the real and substantial body of the Lord. Already 
was the whole of Gaul infected with this his doctrine, dis- 
seminated by means of poor scholars, whom he allured by 
daily hire. On this account pope Leo, of holiest memory, 
alarmed for the catholic faith, calling a council against him 
at Yercelli, dispersed the darkness of this misty error, by the 
effulgence of evangelical testimony. But when, after his 
death, the poison of heresy again burst forth from the bosoms 
of some worthless people where it had long been nurtured, 
Hildebrand, in councils, when he was archdeacon, at Tours,

and after, when pope, at Borne, compelled him, after being 
convicted, to the abjuration of his opinion ; which matters, 
anj person desirous of seeing will find recorded in their pro- 
per place. Archbishop La^Eranc and Guimund, the most 
eloquent man of our times, first monk of St. Leofidd, in Nor- 
mandj, afterwards bishop of Aversa in Apulia, confuted 
him ; but principally and most forcibly the latter. And, 
indeed, though Berengar disgraced the earlier part of his life 
bj defending certain heresies, jet he came so much to his 
senses in riper age, that without hesitation, he was bj some 
esteemed a saint ; admired for innumerable good qualities, 
but especially for his humility and ahns-giving : showing 
himself master of his large possessions, by dispersing, not 
their slave by hoarding and worshipping them. He was so 
guarded with respect to female beauty, that he would never 
suffer a woman to appear before him, lest he should seem to 
enjoy that beauty with his eye, which he did not desire in 
his heart. He was used neither to despise the poor nor flatter 
the rich : to live by nature's rule, ^and having food and 
raiment," in the language of the apostle, '^ therewith to be 
content." In consequence, Hildeberl^ bishop of Mans, a 
first-rate poet, highly conunends him ; whose words I have 
purposely inserted, liiat I may show this celebrated bishop's 
regard to his master ; and at the same lime his opinion wiD 
serve for an example to posterity, how he thought a man 
ought to live : although, perhaps, from the strength of his 
affection, he may have exceeded the bounds of just commend- 
ation. 

Fame, which the urarld allows his due. 
Shall Berengar, when dead, pursue : 
Whom, plac'd on faith's exalted height 
The fifth day ravish'd with fell spite : 
Sad was that day, and &tal too, 
Where grief and loss muted grew, • 

Wherein the church's hope and pride, 
The law, with its supporter, died. 
What sages taught, or poets sung 
Bow'd to his wit, and honey'd tongue. 
Then holier wisdom's path he trod, 
And fiird his heart and lips with God. 
His soul, his voice, his action prov'd 
The great Creator's praise he lov'd. 
So good, so wise, his growing fame 
Shall soar above the greatest name :

Pieferr*d the poor to rich : maintain'd 

The sternest justice. Wealth's wide power 

Ne'er gave to sloth, or waste, an hour. 

Nor could repeated honours, high. 

Seduce him irom humility; 

Who ne'er on money set his mind. 

But griey'd he could no ohiect find 

Where he might give : and helped the poor 

Till poverty assail'd his door. 

His life by nature's laws to guide,

Nor let rank lust disturb his rest.

Ere justice sought her place of rest 

On high, he locked her in his breast.

Surpasses his exceeding famot

Pious and grave, so humble yet, 

That envy ne'er could him beset ; 

For envy weeps, whom still befora

And share the self-^ome portion too. 

Ton may perceive in these verses, that the bishop ex- 
ceeded the jnst measure of praise ; but eloquence is apt to 
recommend itself in such wise; thus a brilliant style pro- 
ceeds in graceful strain ; thus 

** Bewitchiiig eloquence sheds purple flowen." 

But though Berengar himself changed his sentiments, yet 
was he unable to convert all whom he had infected through- 
out the world ; '' so dreadful a thing it is to seduce others 
from what is right, either by example or by word; as, per«

haps, in consequence, you must bear the sins of others after 
having atoned for jour own.** Fulbert, bishop of Chartres, 
whom Mary, the mother of our Lord, was seen to cure when 
sick, by the milk of her breasts, is said to have predicted 
this; for, when lying in the last extremity, he was visited 
by many persons, and the house was scarcely large enough 
to hold the company, he darted his eye through the throng, 
and endeavoured to drive away Berengar, with all the force 
he had remaining; protesting that an immense devil stood 
near him, and attempted to seduce many persons to follow 
him, by beckoning with his hand, and whispering some 
enticement Moreover, Berengar himself, when about to 
expire on the day of the Epiphany, sadly sighing, at the 
recollection of the wretched people whom, when a very 
young man, in the heat of error, he had infected with hits 
opinions, exclaimed, *^ To-day, in the day of his manifesta- 
tion, my Lord Jesus Christ will appear to me, either to 
glorify me, as I hope, for my repentance ; or to punish me, 
as I fear, for the heresy I have propagated on others.* 

We indeed believe, that after ecclesiastical benediction, 
those mysteries are the very body and blood of the Saviour ; 
induced to such an opinion, by ihe authority of the ancient 
church, and by many miracles recently manifested. Such as 
that which St Gregory exhibited at Rome; and such as 
Paschasius relates to have taken place in Grennany ; that the 
priest Plegild visibly touched the form of a boy, upon the 
altar, and that after kissing him he partook of him, turned 
into the similitude of bread, after the custom of the church : 
which, they relate, Berengar used arrogantly to cavil at, and 
to say, that '* it was the treacherous covenant of a scoun- 
drel, to destroy with his teeth, him whom he had kissed with 
his mouth.** Such, too, is that concerning the Jewish boy, 
who by chance running playfully into a church, with a 
Christian of the same age, saw a child torn to pieces on the 
altar, and severally divided to the people ; which when, with 
childish innocence, he related as truth to his parents, they 
placed him in a furnace, where the fire was burning and the 
door closed : whence, after many hours, he was snatched by 
the Christians, without ii^uiy to his person, clothes, or hair ; 
and being asked how he could escape the devouring flamea, 
he replied, " That beautiful woman whom I saw sitting in

the chair, whose son was cBvided among the people^ alwajs 
stood at mj right hand in the fomacey keeping off the 
threatening flames and fiery Yolumes with her garments." 

At that tune^ in a province of Wales, cidled Bos, was 
found the sepulchre of Walwin, the noble nephew of Arthur ; 
he reigned, a most renowned knight, in that part of Britain 
which is stiU named Walwerth; but was driyen from his 
kingdom by the brother and nephew of Hengist, (of whom I 
have spoken in my first book,) though not without first 
making them pay dearly for his expulsion. He deservedly 
shared, with his uncle, the praise of retarding, for many 
years, the calamity of his falling country. The sepulchre of 
Arthur is no where to be seen, whence ancient ballads fable 
that he is still to come. But the tomb of the other, as I 
have suggested, was found in the time of king William, on 
the sea-coast, fourteen feet long: there, as some relate, he 
was wounded by his enemies, and suffered shipwreck ; others 
say, he was killed by his subjects at a public entertainment. 
The truth consequently is doubtful ; though neither of these 
men was inferior to the reputation they have acquired. 

This, too^ was the period in which Grermany, for fifty 
years, bewailed the pitiable, and almost fatal government of 
Henry, of whom I have spoken in the history of William. 
He was neither unlearned nor indolent ; but so singled out 
by fate for every person to attack, that whoever took up 
arms against him seemed, to himscdf, to be acting for the 
good of religion. He had two sons, Conrad and Henry : the 
first, not violating the rights of nature towards his father, 
having subjugated Italy, died at Arezzo, a city of Tuscany: 
the other, in his early age, attacking his parent when he was 
somewhat at rest from external molestation, compelled him 
to retire firom the empire, and when he died shortly after, 
honoured him with an imperial funeral. He still survives, 
obstinately adhering to those very sentiments, on account of 
which he thought himself justified in persecuting his father ; 
lor he grants the investiture of churches by tiie staff and 
ring ; and looks upon the pope as not legally elected without 
his concurrence; although Calixtus, who now presides over 
the papal see, has greatly restrained this man's inordinate 
wnbition: but let ti^e reader wait my farther relation of 
these matters in their proper order. 




816 WTLUAM OF MALMESBUBY. ^^ ^' 

Moreover, pope Hildebrand djing, as I have said, and 
Urban being elected bj the cardinals, the emperor persisted 
in his intention of preferring Guibert, of proclaiming him 
pope, and of bringing him to Rome, by the expulsion of the 
other. The army, however, of the marchioness Matilda, a 
woman, who, foi^etful of her sex, and comparable to the 
ancient Amazons, used to lead forth her hardj troops to 
battle, espoused the juster cause, as it seemed, by her assist- 
ance, in succeeding time. Urban obtaining the papal throne, 
held quiet possession of it for eleven years. After him 
Paschal was appointed by the Romans, who held Henry's 
concurrence in contempt Guibert yet burdened the earth 
with his existence, the only sower of sedition, who never, 
during his whole life, laid aside his obstinacy, nor conformed 
to justice; saying, that the decision of the emperor ought 
to be observed; not that of the assassins, or parchment- 
mongers of Rome.* In consequence, both of them being 
excommunicated in several councils, they treated the sen- 
tence with ridicule. Notwithstanding these circumstances, 
there were many things praiseworthy in the emperor: he 
was eloquent, of great abilities, well r^ad, actively charitable ; 
had many good qualities, both of mind and person : was ever 
prepared for war, insomuch that he was sixty-two times 
engaged in battle; was equitable in adjusting differences; 
and when matters were unsuccessful, he would prefer Jbis 
griefs to heaven, and wait for redress from thence. Many of 
his enemies perished by untimely deaths. 

I have heard a person of the utmost veracity rdate, that 
one of his adversaries, a weak and factious man, while 
reclining at a banquet, was, on a sudden, so completely sur- 
rounded by mice, as to be unable to escape. So great was 
the number of these little animals, that there could scaroely 
be imagined more in a whole province. It was in vain, that 
they were attacked with clubs and fn^ments of the benches 
which were at hand : and though they were for a long time 
assailed by aU, yet they wreaked their deputed curse on no

one else; pursuing him only with their teeth, and with a 
kind of dreadful squeaking. And although he was carried 
out to sea about a javelin's cast bj the servants, jet he could 
not hj these means escape their violence ; for immediately 
so great a multitude of mice took to the water, that jou 
would have sworn the sea was strewed with chaff. But 
when thej began to gnaw the planks of the ship, and the 
water, rushing through the chinks, threatened inevitable 
shipwreck, the servants turned the vessel to the shore. The 
animals, then also swimming close to the ship, landed first. 
Thus the wretch, set on shore, and soon after entirelj 
gnawed in pieces, satiated the dreadful hunger of the mice. 

I deem this the less wonderful, because it is well known, 
that in Asia, if a leopard bite any person, a party of mice ^ 
approach directly, to dischai^e their urine on the wounded 
man ; and that a filthy deluge of their water attends his 
death ; but if^ by the care of servants driving them oS, the 
destruction can be avoided during nine days ; then medical 
assistance, if called in, may be of service. My informant 
had seen a person wounded after this manner, who, de- 
spairing of safety on shore, proceeded to sea, and lay at an- 
chor; when immediately more than a thousand mice swam 
out, wonderful to relate, in the rinds of pomegranates, the 
insides of which they had eaten; but they were drowned 
through the loud shouting of the sailors. " For the Creator 
of all things has made nothing destitute of sagacity ; nor any 
pest without its remedy." 

During this emperor's reign flourished Marianus Scotus,* 
first a monk of Fulda, afterwards a recluse at Mentz, who, 
by renouncing the present life, secured the happiness of that ^ 
which is to come. During his long continued leisure, he 
examined the writers on Chronology, and discovered the 
disagreement of the cycles of Dionysius the Little with 
the evangelical computation. Wherefore reckoning every 
year from the beginning of the world, he added twenty- 
two, which were wanting, to the above mentioned cycles ; 
but he had few, or no followers of his opinion. Wherefore 
I am often led to wonder, why such unhappiness should

attach to the learned of our tune, that in so great a nmnher 
of scholars and students, pale with watching, scarcely one 
can obtain unqualified commendation for knowledge. So 
much does andent custom please, and so little encourage- 
ment, though deserved, is given to new discoveries, however 
consistent with truth. All are anxious to- grovel in the old 
track, and everjthing modem is contemned ; and therefore, 
as patronage alone can foster genius, when that is withheld, 
every exertion languishes. 

But as I have mentioned the monastery of Fulda, I will 
relate what a reverend man, Walker, prior of Medvem, 
whose words if any disbelieve he ofiends against holiness, 
told me had happened there. '* Not more than fifteen years 
have elapsed," said he, ''since a contagious disease attacked 
the abbat of that place, and afterwards destroyed many of 
the monks. The survivors, at first, b^an each to fear for 
himself, and to pray, and give alms more abundantly than 
usual In process of time, however, for such is the nature 
of man, their fear gradually subsiding, they began to omit 
them ; the cellarer more especially : who publicly and ab- 
surdly exclaimed, that tlie stock of provision was not ade- 
quate to such a consumption ; that he had lately hoped for 
some reduction of expense from so many funerals, but that 
his hopes were at an end, if the dead consumed what the 
living could not It happened on a certain night, when, 
from some urgent business, he had deferred going to rest 
for a long time, that having at length despatched every 
concern, he went towards the dormitory. And now you 
shall hear a strange circiunstance : he saw in the chapter- 
house, the abbat, and all who had died that year, sitting 
in the order they had departed : when affrighted and en- 
.deavouring to escape, he was detained by force. Being 
reproved and corrected, after the monastic manner, with a 
scourge, he heard the abbat speak precisely to the following 
effect : that it was foolish to look for advantage by another's 
death, when all were subject to one conmion fate ; that it 
was an impious thing, that a monk who had passed his 
whole life in the service of the church should be grudged 
the pittance of a single year after his death ; that he fainir 
«elf should die very shortly, but that whatever others might 
do for him, should redound only to the advantage of those

whom be had defrauded ; that he might now go and correct, 
by his example, those whom he had corrupted by bis ex- 
pressions." He departed, and demonstrated that he had 
seen nothing imaginary, as well by his recent stripes, as 
by his death, which shortly followed. 

In the meantime, while employed on other subjects, both 
matter and inclination have occurred for the relation ok 
what was determined in William's time, concerning the 
controversy still existing between the archbishops of Can- 
terbury and York. And that posterity may be fully in- 
formed of this business, I will subjoin the opinions of the 
ancient fatWs./^ yf-t<?^ 
JPope Gregory to At^tUtine^yJirst ar^ibuhop of Canterbury, 

^^Let your'Jurisdiction not xSUy extend over the bishops 
you shall have ordained, or such as have been ordained by 
the bishop of York, but also over all the priests of Britain, 
by the authority of our Lord Jesus Christ.'* 

Boniface Jo Justus^ archbishop of Canterbury. 

**^vr be it from every Christian, that anything concern- 
ing the city of Canterbury be diminished or changed, in 
present or future times, which was appointed by our pre- 
decessor pope Gregory, however human circumstances may 
be changed: but more especially, by the authority of St. 
Peter the prince of apostles, we command and ordain, that 
the city of Canterbury shall ever hereafter be esteemed the 
metropolitan see of all Britain ; and we decree and appoint, 
immutably, that all the provinces of the kingdom of Eng- 
land shall be subject to the metropolitan church of the afore- 
said see. And if any one attempt to injure this church, 
which is more especially under the power and protection 
of the holy Roman church, or to lessen the jurisdiction con- 
ceded to it, may Grod expunge him from the book of life ; and 
let him know, that he is bound by the sentence of a curse." 

Alexander to WUUamy king of England. 

** The cause of Alric, formerly called bishop of Chiches- 
ter, we have entrusted to our brother bishop, Lanfranc, to 
be by him diligently reconsidered and determined. We 
have also commended to him the labour of deciding the 
dispute which has arisen between the archbishop of York,

and the bishop of Dorchester, on matters belonging to their 
dioceses; stricidy ordering him to examine this cause most 
diligently and bring it to a just termination. Besides, we 
have so fully committed to him the authority of our per- 
sonal and pontifical power in considering and settling causes, 
that whatever he shall, according to justice, have determined, 
shall be regarded as firm and indissoluble hereafter, as though 
it had been adjudged in our presence." 

"In the year of our Lord Jesus Christ's incarnation 1072, 
^ of the pontificate of pope Alexander the eleventh, and of 
^ vCl ^^ reign of William, glorious king of England, and duke 
' ^ of Normandy, the sixth ; by the command of the said pope 
Alexander, and permission of the same king, in presence of 
himself, his bishops, and abbats, the question was agitated 
concerning the primacy which Lanfranc,* archbishop of 
Canterbury, claimed in right of his church, over that of 
York ; and concerning the ordination of certain bishops, of 
which it was not clearly evident, to whom they especially 
pertained ; and at length, after some time it was proved and 
shown by the distinct authority of various writings, that the 
church of York ought to be subject to that of Canterbury, 
and to be obediei^t to the appointments of its archbishop,' as 
primate of all England, in all such matters as pertained to 
the Christian religion. But the homage of the bishop of 
Durham, that is of Lindisfame, and of all the countries be- 
yond the limits of the bishop of Lichfield, and the great 
river Humber, to the farthest boundaries of Scotland, and 
whatever on this side of the aforesaid river justly pertains 
to the diocese of the church of York, the metropolitan of 
Canterbury allowed for ever to belong to the archbishop of 
York and his successors : in such sort, that if the archbishop 
of Canterbury chose to call a council, wherever he deemed 
fit, the archbishop of York was bound to be present at his 
command, with all his suffiragan bishops, and be obedient to 
his canonical injunctions. And Lanfranc the archbishop 
proved from the ancient custom of his predecessors, that 
the archbishop of York was bound to make profession, even 
—with an oath, to the archbishop of Canterbury ; but through

regard to the king, he dispensed with the oath from Thomas^ 
archbishop of York; and received his written profession 
onlj: bat not forming a j^eeedent for his snccessors who 
might choose to exact the oath, together with the profession,

bury should die, the archbishop of Yoi^ shall come to 
Canterbury; and, with the other bishops of the church 
aforesaid, duly consecrate the person elect as his lawful 
primate. But if the archbishop of York shall die, his suc- 
cessor, accepting the gift of the archbishopric from the king, 
shall come to Canterbury, or where the archbishop of Can-

ordination. To this ordinance consented the king aforesaid, 
and the archbishops, Lanfranc of Canterbury, and Thomas

have been wholesomely enacted by the holy fathers. For 
hence arise strifes, dissensions, envyings, contentions, and 
other things, which plunge the lovers of them into eternal 
punishment. And the more exalted the rank of any person 
is, so much the more exact should be his obedience to divine 
commands : wherefore I Thomas, now ordained metropolitan 
bishop of the church of York, hearing and knowing your

matter I was doubtful, while I was yet about to be ordained 
by you : wherefore I promised obedience unconditionally to 
you, but conditionally to your successors." 

The archbishop of Canterbury, as I remember to have ob- 
served in my first book, originally had subject to him, these 
bishops : London, Winchester, Rochester, Sherborne, Wor- 
cester, Hereford, Lichfield, Selsey, Leicester, Hehnham, 
Sidnacester, Dunwich; in the time of king Edward the

Eider were added, Cornwall, Crediton, Wells in West Sax* 
onj, and Dorchester in Merda, as I noticed in mj second book. 

The archbishop of York had all the bishops on the farther 
side of the Humber subject to him, as Ripon, Hexham, Lin- 
disfame, Candida Casa, which is now called Whitheme ; and 
all the bishops of Scotland and the Orkneys ; as the archbi- 
shop of Canterbury had those of Ireland and Wales. The 
bishoprics of Ripon and Hexham have long since perished 
by hostile ravages ; Leicester, Sidnacester, and Dunwich, by 
means that I cannot account for ; and, in the time of king 
Edward the Simple, Cornwall and Crediton were united, 
and the bishopric translated to Exeter. In king William's 
time, at this council, it was determined that, according to the 
decrees of the canons, the bishops should quit the villages, 
and fix their abode in the cities of their dioceses ; Lichfield 
therefore migrated to Chester, which was anciently called 
the City of Legions ; Selsey to Chichester ; Helmham first to 
Thetford, and now, by bishop Herbert, to Norwich ; Sher- 
borne to Salisbury ; Dorchester to Lincoln. For Lindisfame 
had long before passed to Durham, and lately Wells to Bath. 

In this assembly Lanfiranc, who was yet uninstructed in 
English matters, inquired of the elder bishops, what was the 
order of sitting in council, as originally appointed. They, 
alleging the difficulty of the question, deferred their answer 
tUl the next day ; when, carefully calling circumstances to 
mind, they asserted that they had seen the arrangement as 
follows : that the archbishop of Canterbury, presiding at the 
ootmcil, should have, on the right hand, the archbishop of 
Tork, and next him the bishop of Winchester ; and on his 
left, the bishop of London. But should it ever happen, 
through necessity, that the primate of Canterbury should be 
absent, or should he be dead, the archbishop of York, presid- 
ing at the council, should have the bishops of London on his 
right hand, and of Winchester on his lefl; and the rest 
should take their seats according to the time of their ordina- 
tion. 

At that time, too, the claim of the archbishop of York on 
the see of Worcester and Dorchester was decided and set at 
rest. For he said that they ought to be subject to his juris- 
diction; which, after having pondered for some time in 
secret, when he proceeded to Rome with Lanfranc to receive 

T 2

their pallB from the pope, he brought pahilicly before the 
Roman ooort. Lanfraac, tiiough for the most part unmoyed 
by ix^jmy, could not help betrajing, by his oountenance, his 
emotion at such a wanton and anheard-(^ attack, though he 
for some time refrained from speaking. But pope Alexan- 
der, who felt much for Lanfranc's distress, for he had even 
oondesoendingly risen from his seat wh^ he approached, 
professing thi^ he paid him this mark of respect) not from 
honour to the archbishop but regard to his learning, removed 
from himself the unpleasant task of deciding, and r^erred the 
adjudication of it to an English council In consequence, as 
I have related, the matter, after deep investigation, came to 
this termination in the present council ; that, as these bishops 
were on this side of the Humber, they should belong to 
Canterbury, but all beyond that river to York. 

Here the pious simplicity of St Wulstan, Inshop of Wor- 
cester, and his noble confidence in Grod, demand praise and 
approbation. For when called in question as wdl concern- 
ing this business, as on his slender attainments in learning, 
he had retired to consider more carefully what answer he 
should make, his mind undisturbed by tumult : " Believe 
me," said he, ** we have not yet sung the service for the sixth 
hour : let us sing the service therefore.'' And, on his com- 
panions suggesting the necessity of first expediting the busi- 
ness they had met upon ; that there was ample time for sing- 
ing, and that the king and the nobility would laugh at them^ 
if they heard of it: ''Truly,** said he, ''let us first do our 
duty towards Grod, and afterwards settle the disputes of 
men.** Having sung the service, he directly proceeded 
towards the council-chamber, without devising any subter- 
fuge, or any attempt to disguise the truth. To his d^>end- 
ents, who were desirous of withholding him, and who could 
not be persuaded but their cause was in danger, he said, 
" Know for certain, that I here visibly perceive tbose holy 
archbishops, Dunstan of Canterbury, and Oswald of York ; 
who^ defending me this day with their prayers, will darken 
the understandings of my gainsayers.** Then giving his 
benedicticm to a monk, a man of little eloquence^ but some- 
what acquainted with the Norman language, on summing up 
bis cause, he obtained that he, who was before thought unwor- 
thy of the management of his own diocese^ should be humbly

enlreated by the archbisliap <3i£ York, to condescend to visit 
those parts of his province, which himself, through dread of 
enemies, or ignorance of the hmguage, had refrained from 
approaching. But I will no longer torture the patience of 
mj readers, who perhaps do not regard this matter with 
pleasure, as they are in expectation g£ the history of Wil- . 
Ham's snccessors ; though, if I am not too partial to myself, ) 
a variety of anecdote can be displeasing to no one, unless he } 
be morose enough to rival the superciliousness of Cato. But 
whoever is so inclined, will find such other matters in the 
fourth and fifth book, for here the third shall terminate.^ 



BOOK IV. ^ 

PREFACE. 

I AM aware, that many persons think it unwise in me^ to 
have written the history of the kings of my own time ; 
alleging, that in such a work, truth is often made shipwreck 
of, while falsehood meets with support : because to relate the 
crimes of contemporaries, is attended with danger ; their-good 
actions with applause. Whence it arises, say tfiey, that, as 
all things have, now, a natural tendency to £vil rather than 
to good, the historian passes over any disgraceftd transaction, 
however obvious, through timidity ; and, for the sake of 
approbation, feigns good qualities, when he cannot find them. 
There are others, who, judging of us by their own indolence, 
deem us unequfll to so great a task, and brand our under- 
taking with malignant censure. Wherefore, impelled by 
the reasoning of the one, or the contempt of the other, I had 
long since voluntarily retired to leisure and to silence : bnt^ 
after indulging in them for a lime, the accustomed inclina- 
tion for study again strongly beset me ; as it was impossible 
f^r me to be unoccupied, and I knew not how to give my- 
self up to those forensic avocations, which are beneath the 
notice of a literary character. To this was to be added the

mcitements of my Mends, to whose soggestioiiSy though onlj 
implied, I ought to pay regard : and they indeed gently 
urged me, already sufficiently disposed, to prosecute my un- 
dertaking. Animated, therefore, by the advice of those 
whom I lore most affectionately, I advance to give them a 
lasting pledge of friendship from the stores of my research. 
Gratefid also to those who are in fear for me, lest I should 
either ezdte hatred, or disguise the truth, I will, by the 
help of Christ, make such a return for their kindness, as 
neither to become odious, nor a falsifier. For I will describe, 
both what has been done well, or otherwise, in such wise, 
and so safely steer between Scylla and Charybdis, that my 
u>pinions shall Qot be concealed, though some matters may be 
omitted in my history. Moreover, to those who undenndne 
the labours of others, I make the same answer as St Jerome 
formerly did to his critics ; ^* Let them read if they like : if 
not^ let them <cast it aside ; because I do not obtrude my 
work on the fastidious, but I dedicate it, if any think it 
worth their notice, to the studious ;" which even these men 
will readily pronounce to be consonant to equity, unless they 
are of the number of those, of whom it is said ; *' Fools are 
easy to confute, but not so easy to restrain." I will relate, 
then, in this, the fourth book of my work, every thing which 
may be said of William, son of William the Great, in such 
manner that neither shall the truth suffer, nor shall the 
dignity of the prince be obscured. Some matters also will 
be inserted in these pages, which in his time were calami- 
tous in this country, or glorious elsewhere, as far as my 
knowledge extends. More especially, the pilgrimage of the 
Christians to Jerusalem, which it w^ be proper to annex in 
this place ; because an expedition, so famous in these times, 
is well worth hearing, and will also be an incitement to 
valour. Not indeed that I have any confidence these transac- 
tions will be better treated by me than by others who have 
written on the subject, but that, what many write, many may 
read. Yet, lest so long a prefiice should disgust my reader, 
I will immediately enter on my work.

Of Wimam the Second. [a.d. 1087—1 100.] 

William then, the son of William, was bom in Normandy 
many yean before his father came to England ; and being 
educated with extreme care by his parents, as he had natu- 
rally an ambitious mind, he at length reached the summit of 
dignity. He would no doubt have been a prince incom- 
parable in our time, had not his father's greatness eclipsed 
him ; and had not the fates cut short his years too early for' 
his maturer age to correct errors, contracted by the licen- 
tiousness of power, and the impetuosity of youth. When 
childhood was passed, he spent the period of youth in mili- 
tary occupations ; in riding, throwing the dart, contending 
witii his elders in obedience, with ti^ose of his own age in 
ncdoa : and he esteemed it injurious to his reputation, if he 
was not the foremost to take arms in military commotions ; 
unless he was the first to challenge the adversary, or when 
challenged, to overcome him. To his father he was ever 
dutiful ; always exerting himself in his sight in battle, ever 
at his side in peace. His hopes gradually expanding, he 
already aspired after the succession, especially on the 
r^ection of his elder brother, while the tender age of the 
jounger gave him no uneasiness. Thus, adopted as his suc- 
cessor by his father during his last iUness, he set out to take 
possession of the kingdom ere the king had breathed his last : 
where being gladly received by the people, and obtaining the 
keys of the treasury, he by these means subjected all Eng- 
land to his wilL Archbishop Lanfranc, the grand mover of 
every thing, had educated him, and made him a knight,* 
and now he favoured his pretensions to the throne ; by his 
authority and assistance William was crowned on the day of 
the saints Cosmas and Damian,f and passed the remainder of 
the winter quietly and with general &vour. 

At the expiration of this period, in the beginning of spring, 
his first contention was with his uncle^ Odo, bishop of 

** " At this period the cnstom of receiving knighthood ' fiom the hands 
of bishops or abbots ret obtained. There is a law of Heniy I., prohibiting

Bajeux. For when Odo, on his release from confinement, 
as I have related, had firmly established his nephew, Robert, 
in the duchy of Normandy, he came to England, and received 
from the king the earldom of Kent But when he saw eveiy 
thing in the kingdom managed, not at his own pleasure, as 
formerly, for the administration of public affidrs was now 
committed to William, iHshop of Durham, he was mored 
with envy, and having revolted frmn the king, he tainted 
many others by insinuating, that the kingdom belonged to 
Robert, who was oi gentler disposition, and whose youthful 
follies had been corrected by many adversities ; that William, 
delicately brought up, and overbearing from that ferocity of 
mind which was manifest in his countenance^ would dare 
every thing, in defiance of right and equity : that it must 
soon come to pass, that they would lose the honours they 
had already obtained with so much difficulty : that nothing 
was gained by the father's death, if those whom he had cast 
into prison, were to be killed by the son. To this effect he 
used, at first, secretly to mutter, together with Roger Mont- 
gomery, Gosfrith, bishop of Coutances, with his nephew 
Robert earl of Northumberland, and others ; afterwards they 
were more open in their clamours, rq)eatuig and dissemi- 
nating them by letters and by emissaries. Moreover, even 
William, bishop of Durham, the confidential minister of the 
^ing, had joined in their treachery. This was matter of 
great concern to WUliam, it is said ; because, together with 
the breach of friendship, he was disappointed of the resources 
of the distant provinces. Odo now carried off booty of eveiy 
kind to Rochester, plundering the king's revenues in Kent, 
and especially the lands of the archbishop ; breathing eternal 
hatred against him, because, he said, it was by his advice, 
tiiat his brother had cast him into chains. Nor was this 
assertion false : for when William the elder formerly com- 
plained to Lanfranc, that he was deserted by his brother : 
** Seize, and cast him into chains," said he. ** What T re- 
plied the king, '' he is a clergyman I" Then the archbishop 
with playful archness, as Persius says^ " balancing the olgec- 
tion with nice antithesis,*^ rejoined, ^'you will not seize the 
bishop of Bayeux, but confine the earl of Kent"

Bishop Grosfrith with his nephew, depopulattng Batl^ and 
Berkelej, and part of the coantj of Wilts, treasured up 
their spoils at Bristol Roger Montgomery sending out his 
armj with the Welsh from Shrewsbury, plundered Worces- 
tershire. They had now hostilely approached Worcester, 
when the king's soldiers who guarded it, relying on the bless* 
ing of bishop Wulstan, to whom the custody of the castle 
was committed, though few in number, dispersed this multi- 
tude ; and after wounding and killing many, took some of 
them prisoners. Moreover, Roger Bigod at Norwich, and 
Hugo de Grentmeisnil at Leicester, each with their party, 
were plundering in their respectave neighbourhoods. Li 
vain, however, did the whole power of revolt rage against a 
man, who was deficient neither in prudence nor in good for- 
tune. For seeing almost all the Normans leagued in one 
furious conspiracy, he sent alluring letters, summoning to 
him such brave and honest English as yet remained ; and 
complaining to them on the subject of his wrongs, he bound 
them to his party, by promising them wholesome laws, a 
diminution of tribute, and free leave to hunt.* With equal 
canning he circumvented Roger Montgomery, when riding 
with him, with dissembled pe^dy ; for taking him aside, he 
loaded him with odium, saying, that he would willingly retire 
from the government, if it seemed meet to him and to the 
rest whom his iaAher had left as his guardians ; that he could 
not understand, why they were so outrageous ; if they wanted 
mone^, they might have what they pleased ; if an increase 
of their estates, they might have that also ; in short, they 
might have whatever they chose ; only let them be careful 
that the judgment of his father was not called in question : 
for, if they thought it ought to be disregarded in the instance 
of himself, it might be a bad example for them : for the 
same person made him king, who had made them earls. 
Sxdted by these words and promises, the earl, who, next to 
Odo^ had been the chief leader of the faction, was the first 
to desert. Proceeding, therefore^ immediately against the 
rebels, he laid siege to the castles of his uncle at Tunbridge 
and at Pevensey, and seizing him in the latter compelled 
him to swear, as he dictated, that he would depart England, 
and deliver up Rochester. To fulfil this promise he sent him

forward with a party he could relj on, intending to follow at 
hia leiaure. At that time almost all the young nobility of Eng- 
land and Normandy were at Rochester : three sons of earl 
Roger, Eustace the younger of Boulogne, and many others 
not deserving notice. The royal party, accompanying the 
bishop, were few and unarmed, for who could fear treachery 
where he was present? and going round the walls, they 
called the townsmen to open the gates ; for so the bishop in 
person, and the absent king commanded. Observing from 
the wall, however, that the countenance of the bishop ill 
agreed with the language of the speakers, they suddenly 
sallied out, took horse in an instant^ and carried off, together 
with the bishop, the whole party, captive. The report of 
this transaction quickly reached the king. Fierce from the 
injury, and smothering his indignation, he calls together his 
faithful English subjects, and orders them to summon all 
their countrymen to the siege, unless any wished to be 
branded with the name of *' Nidering,"* which implies 
^abandoned." The English who thought nothing more dis- 
graceful than to be stigmatised by such an appellation, flocked 
in troops to the king, and rendered his army invincible. 
Nor could the townsmen longer delay submission ; expe- 
riencing, that a party, however noble, or however numer- 
ous, could avail nothing against the king of England. Odo, 
now taken a second time, abjured England for ever : the 
bishop of Durham of his own accord retired beyond sea, the 
king allowing him to escape uninjured out of regard to his 
former friendship : the rest were all admitted to fealty. 
During the interval of this siege, some of the king's fleet de- 
stroyed a party which the earl of Normaudy had sent to 
assist the traitors, partly by slaughter, and partly by ship- 
wreck ; the remainder, intent on escaping, endeavoured to 
make sail ; but being soon after disappointed by its falling 
calm, they became matter for laughter to our people, but 
their own destruction ; for, that they might not be taken 
alive^ they leaped from their vesseb into the sea.

The next year, aa the sense of injuries ever grows keener 
from reconsideration, the king began carefollj to examine^ 
how he might revenge his griefs, and repay his brother for 
this insult In consequence, bj his practices, he bribed the 
garrison, and obtained possession of ihe castle of St Yallery, 
the adjoining port, and the town which is called Albemarle. 
The earl had not the courage to resist, but, by means of am- 
bassadors, acquainted his lord, the kis^ of fVanoe, with the 
violence of his brother, and begged his assistance. The 
French king, inactive, and surfeited with daily gluttony, 
came hiccupping, through repletion, to the war : but, as he 
was making great professions, the money of the king of Eng- 
land met him by the way ; with which his resolution being 
borne down, he unbuckled his armour, and went back to his 
gormandizing. In this manner, Normandy, for a long time, 
groaned under intestine war, sometimes one party, sometimes 
the other being victorious : the nobility, men of fidde temper, 
and faithful to neither brother, exciting their mutual fuiy. 
A few, better advised, attentive to their own advantage, for 
they had possessions in both countries, were mediators of a 
peace : the basis of which was, that the king should get pos- 
session of Maine for the earl ; and the earl should cede to 
the king those castles which he already held, and the monas- 
tery of Feschamp. The treaty was ratified and confirmed by 
the oath of the nobles on both sides. 

Not bng afiter the king went abroad to execute these con- 
ditions. Each leader made great efforts to invade Maine ; 
but when they had completed their preparations, and were 
just ready to proceed,, an obstacle arose, through the spirit of 
Henry, the younger brother, loudly remonstrating against 
their covetousness, which had shared their paternal posses- 
sions between themselves, and blushed not at having left him 
almost destitute. In consequence he took possession of Mount 
St Michael, and harassed, with constant sallies, the besieg- 
ing forces of his brothers. During this siege, a noble speci- 
men of disposition was exhibited, both by the king and by 
the earl : of compassion in the one, and of magnanimity in 
the other. I shall subjoin these instances, for the informa- 
tion of my readers.

and at the same lime confident that none would dtae remtft

for fifteen marks of silver, being killed under him, he was

The soldier who had unhorsed him, was at this instant draw- 
ing his sword to strike him, when, terrified at the eztt^endty 
of his danger, he cried out, '* Hold, rascal, I am the king of 
England.'' The whole troop trembled at the well4uiown 
voice of the prostrate UMnarch, and immediately raised him 
respectfully from the ground, and brought him another horse. 
Leaping into the saddle without waiting assistance^ and dart* 
ing a keen look on the by-standers : " Who unhorsed aoe ?** 
said he. While the rest were silent through fear, the bold 
perpetrator of the deed readily defended himself, saying, 
" 'Twas I, who took you, not for a king, but for a soldier.'' 
The king, soothed, and regaining the serenity of his counte- 
nance, exclaimed, "By the crucifix* at Lucca," for such 
was his oath, " henceforth thou shalt be mine, and, placed 
on my roll, shalt receive the reoompence of this gallant ser- 
vice." Nobly done, magnanimous king ! what encomium 
shall I pass on this speech I Equal to Alexander the Great

mankind : let him try hb courage another way if he chose ; 
and not employ the violence of the elements, but the valour

brother might not be deprived of wttter. This drcumstance, 
when rehited to the king, who was always inclined to warmth 
of temper, made him say to the earl, '^ You well know how 
to carry on war indeed, who allow your enemies plenty of 
water : and pray, how shall we subdue them, if we indulge 
them in food aiid drink ?" But he smiling, uttered this kind 
and truly laudable expression, '* Oh, shame ! should I suffer 
my Iwother to die with thirst ? and where shall we find 
another, if we lose him ?" On this the king, deriding the 
mild temper of the man, put an end to the war without ac- 
complishing his design ; and as the ocxnmotions of the Soots 
and Welsh required his presence, he retired with both his 
brothers to his kingdom. 

Immediately he led an expedition, first against the Welsh, 
and then against the Scots, in which he p^ormed nothing 
worthy of his greatness ; but lost many of his soldiers, and 
had his sumpter-horses intercepted. And, not only at that 
time, but frequently, in Wales, was fortune im&vourable to 
him ; which may seem strange to any one, when the chance 
of war was generally on his side in other places. But it 
i^pears to me that the imevenness of the country, and the 
badness of the weather, as it assisted their rebellion, was 
also an impediment to his valour. But king Henry, who 
now reigns, a man of excellent talents, discovered a mode of 
counteracting their designs: which was, by stationing in 
their country the Flemings, to be a barrier to them, and con- 
stantly keep them within bounds. At that time, by the 
industry of earl Robert, who had long since gained the good 
graces of the Scot, the basis of a peace was laid between 
Malcolm and William. But various grounds of difibrence 
still e"irf^'Pg on both sides, and justice wavering through 
iheoT mutual animosity, Malcolm came of his own accord to 
Gloucester, a hearty solicitor for peace, so that it were on 
equitable conditions. He obtained, however, nothing more 
tlum permission to return unii\jured to his kingdom : for the 
king disdained to take a man by subtlety, whom he might 
have conquered by arms. But the next winter he was dis- 
patched by the party of Robert, earl of NorthumWrland, 
rather through stratagem than force. When his wife, Mar- 
garet, a woman distinguished for alms-giving and for chas- 
tity, heard of lus death* disgusted with the continuance of

life, she eamestlj entreated of God to die. Thej were both 
remarkable for piety, but the queen more especially. For 
during her whole life, wherever she might.be, she had 
twenty-four poor persons whom she supplied with meat and 
clothing. In Lent, waiting for the singing of the priests, 
she used to watch all night in the church, herself assisting at 
triple matins, of the Trinity, of the Cross, of St. Mary, and 
afterwards repeating the Psalter ; with tears bedewing her 
garments, and agitating her breast. Departing from the 
church, she used to feed the poor ; first three, then nine, then 
twenty-four, at last three hundred : herself standing by with 
the kmg, and pouring water on their hands. Edgar his son, 
when expelled by his uncle, was restored by William ; as- 
suredly with a noble compassion, and worthy of so great a 
personage, who, forgetting the injuries of the father, replaced 
the son, when suppliant, on his throne. 

Greatness of soul was pre-eminent in the king, which, in 
process of time, he obscured by excessive severity; vices, 
indeed, in place of virtues, so insensibly crept into his bosom, 
that he could not distinguish them. The world doubted, for 
a long time, whither he would incline; what tendency his 
disposition would take. At first, as long as archbishop Lan- 
franc survived, he abstained from every crime; so that it 
might be hoped, he would be the very mirror of kings. 
After his death, for a time, he showed himself so variable, 
that the balance hung even betwixt vices and virtues. At 
last, however, in his latter years, the desire after good grew 
cold, and the crop of evil increased to ripeness : his liberality 
became prodigality; his magnanimity pride; his austeri^ 
\ cruelty. I may be allowed, with permission of the royal 
majesty, not to conceal the truth; for he feared God but 
litde, man not at all. If any one shall say this is undiscem- 
ing, he will not be wrong ; because wise men should observe 
this rule, *^ Grod ought to be feared at all times ; man, ac- 
cording to circumstances." i He was, when abroad, and in 
public assemblies, of supercilious look, darting his threaten- 
ing eye on the by-stander; and with assumed severity and 
ferocious voice, assailing such as conversed with him. From 
apprehension of poverty, and of the treachery of others, as 
may be conjectured, he was too much given to lucre, and to 
cruelty. At home and at table, with his intimate com- 



A.&.10M.] 0HAR4CTEB OF WILLIAM n. 885 

panions, he gave loose to levitj and to mirth. He was a 
most facetious raUer at anj thing he had himself done amiss, 
in order that he might thus do awaj obloquy, and make it 
matter of jest. But I shall dilate somewhat on that libe- 
rality, in which he deceived himself; and afterwards on his 
other propensities, that I may manifest what great vices 
sprang up in him under the semblance of virtues. 

For, in fact, there are two kinds of givers: the one is 
denominated prodigal, the other liberaL The prodigal are 
such as lavish their money on those things, of which they 
will leave either a transient^ or perhaps no memory in this 
world; neither will they gain mercy by them from God. 
The liberal, are those who redeem the captive from the 
plunderer, assist the poor, or discharge the debts of their 
friends. We must give, therefore, but with discrimination 
and moderation; for many persons have exhausted their 
patrimony by giving inconsiderately. " For what can be 
more silly, than to ^e pains to be no longer able to do that 
which you do with pleasure?^* Some, therefore, when they 
have nothing to give turn to rapine, and get more hatred 
from those from whom they take, than good will from those 
to whom they give. We lament that thus it happened to 
this king; for, when in the very beginning of his reign, 
through fear of tumults, he had assemblc^d soldiers, and 
denied them nothing, promising still greater remuneration 
hereafter; the consequence was, that as he had soon ex- 
hausted his father's treasures, and had then but moderate 
revenues, his substance failed, though the spirit of giving 
remained, which, by habit, had almost become nature. He 
was a man who knew not how to take off from the price of 
any thing, or to judge of the value of goods ; but the trader 
might sell him his commodity at whatever rate, or the soldier 
demand any pay he pleased. He was anxious that the cost 
of his clothes should be extravagant, and angry if they were 
purchased at a low price. One morning, indeed, whUe put- 
ting on his new boots, he asked his chamberlain what they 
cost ; and when he replied, " Three shillings," indignantly 
and in a rage he cried out, " You son of a whore, how long 
has the king worn boots of so paltry a price? go, and bring 

* Cicero de Officiis, li. 15. Much of the aigumeat is bonowcd from the

me a pair woiiih a mark of silver." He went, and bringing 
him a much cheaper pair, told him, &Isel j, that Ihej cost as 
much as he had ordered: ^ Aye," said the king, *^ these are 
suitable to rojal majestj." Thus his chamberlain used to 
charge him what he pleaiied for his clothes; acquiring bj 
these means manj things for his own advantage. 

The fame of his generosity, tiierefore^ pervaded all the 
West, and reached even to the East Military men came to 
him out of every province on this side of the mountains, whom 
he rewarded most profusely. In consequence, when he had 
no longer aught to bestow, poor and exhausted, he turned 
his thoughts to rapine. The rapacity of his disposition was 
seconded by Ralph, the inciter of his covetousness ; a clergy- 
man of the lowest origin, but raised to eminence by his wit 
and subtilty. If at any time a royal edict issued, that Eng- 
land should pay a certain tribute, it was doubled by this 
plunderer of the rich, this exterminator of the poor, this con- 
fiscator of other men's inheritance. He was an invincible 
pleader, as unrestrained in his words as in his actions ; and 
equally furious against the meek or the turbulent. Where- 
fore some people used to laugh,* and say, that he was the 
only man who knew how to employ his talents in this way, 
and cared for no one's hatred, so that he could please Ins 
master. At this person's suggestion, the sacred honours of 
the church, as the pajstors died, were exposed to sale: for 
whenever the death of any bishop or abbat was announced, 
directly one of the king's clerks was admitted, who made an 
inventory of every thing, and carried all i^ture rents into 
the royal exchequer. Li the meantime some person was 
sought out fit to supply the place of the deceased ; not from 
proof of morals, but of money; and, at last, if I may so say, 
the empty honour was conferred, and even that purchased, 
at a great price. These things appeared the more disgrace- 
ful, because, in his father's time, after the decease of a i^hop 
or abbat, all rents were reserved entire, to be given up to the 
succeeding pastor ; and persons truly meritorious, on account 
of their religion, were elected. But in the lapse of a very 
few years, every thing was changed. There was no man 
rich except the money-changer; no derk, unless he was a 
lawyer; no priest, urdess (to use a word which is hardly

Latin*) be was a farmer. Men of the meanest conditioni or 
^^tj of whatever crime, were listened to, if thej could sug- 
gest any thing likely to be advantageous to the king: the 
baiter was loosened from the robber's neck, if he could pro- 
mise any emolument to the sovereign. All military discipline 
being relaxed, the courtiers preyed upon the property of the 
country people, and consumed their substance, ta^g the 
very meat from the mouths of these wretched creatures, f 
Then was there flowiug hair and extravagant dress; and 
then was invented the fashion of shoes { with curved points; 
then the model for young men was to rival women in deli- "^ 
cacy of person, to mince their gait, to walk with loose gesture, 
and half naked. Enervated and effeminate, they unwillingly 
remained what nature had made them; the assailers of 
others' chastity, prodigal of their own. Troops of pathics, 
and droves of harlots, followed the court ; so that it was said, 
with justice, by a wise man, that England would be fortunate 
if Henry could reign ;§ led to such an opinion, because he 
abhorred obscenity from his youth. 

Here, were it necessary, I could add, that archbishop > ^-s' 
Anselm attempted to correct these abuses ; but failing of the 
co-operation of his suffiragans, he voluntarily quitted the 
kingdom, yielding to the depravity of the times. Anselm, -^

spiritaal ; the father of his country, the mirror of the world: 
he, when just about to set sail, after waiting in port for a 
wind, was rifled, as though he had been a public robber ; all 
his bags and packages being brought out and ransacked. Of 
this man's injuries I could speak farther, had the sun wit- 
nessed anj thing more unjust than this single transaction, or 
were it not necessary to omit a relation, which has been 
anticipated by the eloquence of the very reverend Edmer.* 

Hence may be perceived how fierce a flame of evil burst 
forth firom what the king conceived to be liberality. In 
repressing- which as he did not manifest so much diligence 
as negligence, he incurred a degree of infamy, not only 
great^ but scarcely to be wiped out I think undeservedly, 
however ; because he never could have exposed himself to 
such disgrace, had he only recollected the dignity of his 
station. I pass over, therdbre, these matters slightly, and 
hasten in my composition, because I blush to relate the 
crimes of so great a king ; rather giving my attention to 
refute and extenuate them. 

The Jews in his reign gave proofs of their insolence 
towards GU)d. At one time, at Rouen, they endeavoured to 
prevail, by means of presents, on some converted Jews, to 
return to Judaism ; f at another, at London, entering into 
controversy with our bishops ; because the king, in jest, as I 
suppose, had said, that if they mastered the Christians in 

* Edmer, besides constant mention of Anaelm in his Histoiia NoTomm, 
wrote his life also, in a separate fbim. 

f A Jewish youth imagined that St Stephen had appealed to him, and 
commanded him to be baptized : this he obeyed. His &ther immediately 
flew to the king, eanestly entreating an order for his son to be restored to 
the &ith of his ancestors. The king not discoTering any adrantage as likely 
to accrue to himself, remained silent: on this ue Jew offiars him dxlj 
marks, on condition that he would restore his son to Judaism. William 
then orders the youth to be brought before him ; relates his fiither's com- 
plaint, and commands him to renounce his baptism. The lad, astonished, 
replies^ ^ Your mijesty is joking surely." ** I joke with thee,^ exclaims 
the king, ^ thou son of ordure I begone, and obey my commands instantly, 
or by the cross at Lucca I will have your eyes torn out.*' The young man 
remaining inflexible^ he drove him from his presence. The father was 
then ordered before the king, who desired him to pay down the money he 
had promised ; but, on the Jew's remonstrating that he had not reconverted 
his son, and the king's declaring that his labour was not to go unrewarded, 
it was agreed that he should receive half the sum. Edmer. Hist Now.

Open argmnent, be would become one of tbeir sect Tbe 
question tberefore was agitated witb much apprehension on 
tiie part of the bishops and clergy, fearful, through pious 
anxiety, for the Christian faith. fSrom this contest, however, 
the Jews reaped nothing but confusion : though thej used 
repeatedly to boast that they were yanquished, not by 
argument, but by power. 

In later times, that is, about the ninth year of his reign, 
Bobert^ earl of Normandy, at the admonition of pope Urban, 
as will be related hereafter, took the resolution of going to 
Jerusalem, and pawned Normandy to his brother, for the 
sum of ten thousand marks. In consequence, an edict for 
an intolerable tax was circulated throughout England. On 
this the bishops and abbats, in great numbers, went to court, 
to complain of the injury; observing that they could not 
raise so great an impost, unless they drove away their 
wretched husbandmen altogether. To this the courtiers, 
with angry countenance, as usual, replied, *' Have you not 
shrines adorned with gold and silver, fiill of dead men's 
bones ? " deigning the petitioners no other answer. In 
consequence, perceiving the drift of the reply, they took 
off the gold from the shrines of their saints ; robbed their 
crucifixes ; melted their chalices ; not for the service of the 
poor, but of the king's exchequer. For almost every thing, 
whidi the holy parsimony of tiieir ancestors had saved, was 
consumed by the rapacity of these freebooters. 

Just so, too, were their proceedings against their vassals ; 
first taking their money, tiien their land : neither the poor 
man's poverty, nor the rich man's abundance, protecting him. 
He so restricted the right of hunting, which he had formerly 
allowed, that it became a capital offence to take a stag. This 
extreme severity, which was tempered by no affability, was 
the cause of many conspiracies, among the nobili^, against 
his safety : one of whom, Ilobert de Mowbray earl of 
Northumberland, in consequence of very high words between 
bim and the king, retired to his province, with the intention 
of making powerful efforts against his lord ; but William 
pursuing him, he was taken, and doomed to perpetual 
captivity. Another, William de Hou, being accused of 
treachery towards the king, challenged his accuser to single 
combat ; but being unable to justify himself in the duel, he 

z2

was deprived of his sight, and of his manhood. The same 
accusation involved many innocent and honourable men; 
among whom was Williun de Aldrej, a man of handsome 
person, who had stood godfather* with the king. Being 
sentenced to be hanged, he made his confession to Osmund 
bishop of Salisbury, and was scourged at every church of 
the town. Parting his garments to the poor, he went naked 
to the gallows, often making the blood gush from his delicate 
flesh by falling on his knees upon the stones. He satisfied 
the minds of the bbhop, and of the people who followed 
him to the place of punishment, by exclaiming, ** God help 
my soul, and deliver it from evil, as I am free from the 
charge, of which I am accused : the sentence, indeed, passed 
upon me will not be revoked, but I wish all men to be 
certified of my innocence." The bishop then, commending 
his soul to heaven, and sprinkling hini with holy water, 
departed. At his execution, he manifested an admirable 
degree of courage; neither uttering a groan before, nor 
even a sigh, at the moment of his death. 

But still there are some proofs of noble magnanimily in 
the king, the knowledge of which, I will not deny posterity. 
As he was once engaged in hunting in a certain forest, a 
foreign messenger acquainted him that the city of Mans, 
which he had lately added to his dominions on the departure 
of his brother, was besieged. Unprepared as he was, he 
turned his horse instantly, and shaped his journey to the 
sea. When his nobles reminded him, that it would be 
necessary to call out his troops, and put them in array ; *^ I 
shall see," said he^ '^ who will follow me : do you think I 
shall not have people enough? If I know the temper of 
the young men of my kLigdom, they will even brave 
shipwreck to come to me." In this manner he arrived, 
almost unattended, at the sea-coast. The sky at that time 
was overcast, the wind contrary, and a tempest swept the 
surface of the deep. When he determined to embark directly, 
the mariners besought him, to wait tiU the storm should 
subside, and the wind be favourable. " Why," said William, 
** I have never heard of a king perishing by shipwreck : no^ 
weigh anchor immediately, and you shall see the elements 
conspire to obey me." When the report of his having

crossed tlie sea reached the besiegers, thej hastilj retreated. 
One Helias, the author of the commotion, was taken ; to 
"whom, when brought before him, the king siud jocularlj, 
** I have you, master." But he, whose haughty spirit, even 
in such threatening danger, knew not how to be prudent, or 
to speak submissively, replied, ''You have taken me by 
chance ; if I could escape, I know what I would do." At 
this William, almost beside himself with rage, and seizing 
Helias, exclaimed, " You scoundrel ! and what would you 
do ? B^one, depart^ fly : I give you leave to do whatever 
you can ; and by the crucifix at Lucca, if you should 
conquer me, I will ask no return for this favour." Nor did 
he falsify his word, but immediately suffered him to escape ; 
rather admiring than following the fugitive. Who could 
believe this of an unlettered man ? And perhaps there may 
be some person, who, from reading Lucan, may falsely 
suppose, that William borrowed these examples from Julius 
Csesar ; * but he had neither inclination, nor leisure to 
attend to learning ; it was rather the innate warmth of his 
temper, and his conscious valour which prompted him to 
such expressions. And indeed, if our religion would aUow 
it, as the soul of Euphorbus was formerly said to have 
passed into Pythagoras of Samos, so might it equally be 
asserted, that the soul of Julius Cesar had migrated into 
king William. 

He b^an and completed one very noble edifice, the pa- 
lace j in London ; sparing no expense to manifest the great- 
ness of his liberality. His disposition therefore the reader 
will be able to discover &om the circumstances we have 
enumerated. 

Should any one be desirous, however, to know the make 
of his person, he is to understand, that he was well set ; his 
complexion florid, his hair yellow ; of open countenance ; 
cElfferent-coloured eyes, varying with certain glittering specks ; 
of astonishing strength, though not very tdl, and his belly

rather projecting ; of no eloquence, but remarkable for a 
hesitation of speech, especiallj when angry. Many sudden 
and sorrowful accidents happened in his time, which I shall 
arrange singly, according to the years of his rdgn ; chiefly 
Touching for their truth on the credit of the Chronicles. 

In the second year of his reign, on the third before the 
ides of August, a great e^hquake terrified all England with 
a horrid spectacle ; for atTtheJ^uHdipgs were lifl^ up, and 
then again settled as before. A scarcity of every kind of 
produce followed ; the com ripened so slowly, that the har- 
yest was scarcely housed before the feast of St Andrew. 

In his fourth year was a tempest of lightning, and a whirl- 
wind: finally, on the ides of October, at Winchcombe, a 
stroke of lightning beat against the side of the tower with 
such force, that, shattering the wall where it joined to the 
roof, it opened a place wide enough to admit a man ; enter- 
ing there, it struck a very large beam, and scattered frag- 
ments of it over the whole church ; moreover it cast down 
the head of the crucifix, with the right leg, and the image of 
St. Mary. A stench so noisome foUowed, as to be insuffer- 
able to human nostrils. At length, the monk% with aus- 
picious boldness^ entering, defeated the contrivances of the 
devil, by the sprinkling of holy water. But what could this 
mean ? such a thing was unknown to every previous age. 
A tempest of contending winds, from the south-east^ on the 
sixteenth before the kalends of November, destroyed more 
than six hundred houses in London. Churches were heaped 
on houses, and walls on partitions. The tempest proceecBng 
yet farther, carried off altogether the roof of the church of 
St. Mary le Bow, and kOled two men. Rafters and beams 
were whirled through the air, an object of surprise to such 
as contemplated them from a distance ; of alarm, to those 
who stood nigh, lest they should be crushed by them. For 
four rafters, six and twenty feet long, were driven with such 
violence into the ground, that scarcely four feet of them were 
visible. It was curious to see how they had perforated the 
solidity of the public street, maintaining there the same posi- 
tion which they had occupied in the roof from the hand of 
the workman, until, on account of their inconvenience to 
passengers, they were cut off level with the ground, as they 
oould not be otherwise removed.

In his fifth year, a similar thunder-storm at Salisbniy en- 
tirelj destroyed ^e roof of the church-tower, and much 
injured the wall, only five days after Osmund, the bishop of 
famed memorji had consecrated it 

In his sixth year there was such a deluge from rain, and 
such incessant showers as none had ever remembered. 
Afterwards, on the approach of winter, the rivers were so 
frozen, that they bore horsemen and waggons ; and soon 
after, when the frost broke, the bridges were destroyed by 
the drifting of the ice. . 

In bis seventh year, on account of the heavy tribute which I 
the king, while in Normandy, had levied, agriculture failed ;0 
of which failure the immediate consequence was a famine. 
This also gaining ground a mortality ensued, so general, that 
the dying wanted attendance, and the dead, burul. At that / 
time, too, the Welsh, fiercely raging against the Normans^ ^ 
and depopulating the county of Chester and part of Shrop- 
shire, obtained Anglesey by force of arms. 

In his tenth year, on the kalends of October, a comet 
appeared for fifteen diays, turning its larger train to the east, 
and the smaller to the south-east. Other stars also appeared, 
darting, as it were, at each other. This was the year in 
which Anselm, that light of England, voluntarily escaping 
firom the darkness of error, went to Rome. 

In his eleyenth year, Magnus, king of Norway, with Ha- 
rold, son of Harold, formerly king of England, subdued the 
Orkney, Mevanian, and other circumjacent isdes ; and was 
now obstinately bent against England from Anglesey. But 
Hugh, earl of Chester, and Hugh, earl of Shrewsbury, op- 
posed him ; and ere he could gain the continent, forced hun 
to retire. Here fell Hugh of Shrewsbury, being struck from 
a distance with a &tal arrow. 

In his twelfth year an excessive tide flowed up the Thames, 
and overwhelmed many villages, with their inhabitants. 

In his thirteenth year, which was the last of his life, there 
were many adverse events ; but the most dreadful circum- 
stance was that the devil visibly appeared to men in woods 
and secret places, and spoke to them as they passed by. 
Moreover in the county of Berks, at the village of Finch- 
hampstead, a fountain so plentifully flowed with blood for 
fifteen whole days, that it discoloured a neighbouring pool

The king heard of it and laughed ; neither did he care for 
his own dreams, nor for what others saw concerning him. 

Thej relate manj visions and predictions of his death, 
three of which, sanctioned bj the testiiocmj- of credible au- 
thors, I shall communicate to mj readers. £dmer, the his- 
torian of our times, noted for hisyeradtj, sajs that Anselm^ 
the noble exile, with whom~aII reEgion was also banished, 
came to Mardgnj that he might communicate his sufferings 
to Hugo, abbat of Clugnj. There, when the conversation 
turned upon king William, the abbat aforesaid observed, 
'' Last night that king was brought before Grod ; and bj a 
deliberate judgment, incurred the sorrowful sentence of 
damnation.'* How he came to know this he neither explained 
at the time, nor did anj of his hearers ask : nevertheless, out 
of respect to his piety, not a doubt of the truth of his words 
remained on the minds of any present. Hugh led such a 
life, and had such a character, that all regarded his discourse 
and venerated his advice, as though an oracle from heaven had 
spoken. And soon after, the king being slain as we shall 
relate, there came a messenger to entreat the archbishop to 
resume his see. 

The day before the king died, he dreamed that he was let 
blood by a surgeon ; and that the stream, reaching to hea- 
ven, clouded the light, and intercepted the day. Calling on 
St Mary for protection, he suddenly awoke, commanded a 
light to be brought, and forbade his attendants to leave him. 
Thej then watched with him several hours imtil daylight. 
Shortly after, just as the day began to dawn, a certain fo- 
reign monk told Robert Fitz Hamon, one of the principal 
nobility, that he had that night dreamed a strange and fear- 
fid dream about the king : *' That he had come into a certain 
church, with menacing and insolent gesture, as was his cus- 
tom, looking contemptuously on the standers by ; then 
violently seizing the crucifix, he gnawed the arms, and al- 
most tore away the legs : that the image endured this for a 
long time, bat at length struck the king with its foot in such 
a manner that he fell backwards : from his mouth, as he lay 
prostrate, issued so copious a flame that the volumes <» 
«moke touched the very stars.** Robert, thinkii^ that thia

laughing, exclaimed, " He is a monk, and dreams for money 
like a monk : give him a hundred shillings.'* Neverthe^ 
less, being greatly moved, he hesitated a long while whether 
lie should go out to hunt, as he had designed : his friends 
persuading him not to suffer the truth of Sie dreams to be 
tried at his personal risk. In consequence, ,he abstained 
from the chase before dinner, dispelling the uneasiness of 
his unregulated mind by serious business. They relate, that, 
having plentifully regaled that day, he soothed his cares with 
a more than usual quantity of wine. After dinner he went 
into the foresl^ attended by few persons ; of whom the most 
intimate with him was Walter, sumamed Tirel, who had 
been induced to come from France by the libenJity of the 
king. This man alone had remained with him, while the 
others, employed in the chase, were dispersed as chance 
directed. The sun was now declining, when the king, draw- 
ing his bow and letting fly an. arrow, slightly wounded a 
stag which passed before hun ; and, keenly gazing, followed 
it, still running, a long time with his eyes, holding up his 
hand to keep off the power of the sun's rays. At this instant 
Walter, conceiving a noble exploit, which was while the 
king's attention was otherwise occupied to transfix another 
stag which by chance came near him, unknowingly, and 
without power to prevent it. Oh, gracious God ! pierced his 
breast with a fatal arrow.* On receiving the wound, the 
king uttered not a word ; but breaking off the shaft 6f the 
weapon where it projected from his body, fell upon the 
wound, by which he accelerated his death. Walter imme- 
diately ran up, but as he found him senseless and speechless, 
he leaped swiftly upon his horse, and escaped by spurring 
him to his utmost speed. Indeed there was none to pursuq 
him : some connived at his flight ; others pitied him ; and all

fect construction, even though he had nerer beoi buried 
there. He died in the year of our Lord's incarnation 1100, 
of his reign the thirteenth, on the fourth before the nones of 
August, aged above forty years. He formed migh^ plans, 
which he would have brought to effect, could he have spun 
out the tissue of fate, or broken through, and disengaged 
himself from, the violence of fortune. Such was the energy 
of his mind, that he was bold enough to promise Mtw^lf any 
kingdom whatever. Indeed the day before his death, being 
asked where he would keep his Christmas, he answered, in 
Poitou ; because the earl of Poitou, wishing anxiously to 
go to Jerusalem, was said to be about to pawn his territory 
to him. Thus, not content with his paternal possessiona, 
and allured by expectation of greater glory, he grasped at 
honours not pertaining to him. He was a man much to be 
pitied by the clergy, for throwing away a soul which they 
could not save ; to be beloved by stipendiary soldiers^. for 
the multitude of his gifts ; but not to be lamented by the peo- 
ple, because he suffered their substance to be plundered. I 
remember no council being held in his time, wherein the health 
, of the church might be strengthened through the correction of 
« abuses. He hesitated a long time ere he bestowed ecclesias- 
tical honours, either for the sake of emolument, or of weigh- 
ing desert So that on the day he died, he held in his own 
I hands three bishoprics, and twelve vacant abbeys. Besides, 
seeking occasion from the schism between Urban in Borne 

and Guibert at Ravenna, he forbade the payment of the tri-

bute f to the holy see : though he was more inclined to BBtvonr

tween himself and Ansefan was, that this man, so dear to Grod,

In his time b^an the Cistertian order, which is now both 
believed and asserted to be the surest road to heaven.* To 
speak of this does not seem irrelevant to the work I have 
undertaken, since it redounds to the gloiy of England to 
have produced the distinguished man who was the author and 
promoter of that rule. To us he belonged, and in our schools 
passed the earlier part of his life. Wherefore, if we are not 
envious, we shall embrace his good qualities the more kindly 
in proportion as we knew them more intimatelj. Axkd, 
iiK»eover, I am anxious to extol his praise, ''because it is 
a mark of an ingenuous mind to approve that virtue in 
others, of which in yourself you regret the absence." He 
Was named Harding, and bom in England of no very IQus- 
trious parents. Ffom his early years, he was a monk at 
Sherborne; but when secular desires had captivated his 
youth, he grew disgusted with the monastic garb, and went 
first to Scotland, and afterwards to France. Here, after 
some years' e xercise j ti thi» ]|ihftyRl nrtA^ he became awakened 
toJhaigYe.ijCjTOcl. For, when manlier years had put away 
childish things, he went to Rome with a clerk who partook 
of his studies ; neither the length and difficulty of the jour- 
ney, nor the scantiness of their means of subsistence by the 
way, preventing them, both as they went and returned, froip 
singing daily the whole psalter. Indeed the mind of this 
celebrated man was already meditating the design which 
0oon after, by the grace of God, he attempted to put in exe- 
cution. For returning into Burgundy, he was shorn at Mo- 
lesmes, a new and magnificent monastery. Here he readily 
admitted the first elements of the order, as he had formerly 
seen them; but when additional matt^ were proposed for 
his observance, such as he had neither read in the rule nor 
seen elsewhere, he began, modestly and aa became a monk, 
to ask the reason of them, saying ; ^ By reason the supreme 
Creator has made all things ; l^. reason he gov^s aU things ; 
by reason the fabric of the worts' devolves ; by reason even 
the planets move ; by reason the elements are directed ; and

by reason, and bj due regulation, our nature ought to con- 
duct itself. But since, tkrough sloth, she too often departs 
from reason, manj laws were, long ago, enacted for her use ; 
and, latterl J, a divine rule has been promulgated bj St. Bene- 
dict^ to bring back the deviations of nature to reason. In 
this, though some things are contained the design of which I 
cannot fathom, jet I deem it necessary to yield to authority. 
And though reason and the authority of the holy writers 
may seem at variance, yet still they are one and the same. 
For since God hath created and restored nothing without 
reason, how can I believe that the holy fathers, no doubt 
strict followers of God, could command anything but what 
was reasonable, as if we ought to give credit to their bare 
authority. See then that you bring reason, or at least autho- 
rity, for what you devise ; although no great credit should 
be given to what is merely supported by human reason, be- 
cause it may be combated with arguments equally forcible. 
Therefore from that rule, which, equally supported by reasost 
and authority, appears as if dictated by the spirit of all just 
persons, produce precedents, which if you fail to do^ in vain 
shall you profess his rule, whose regulations you disdain to 
comply with." . 

Sentiments of this kind, spreading as usual from one to 
another, justly moved the hearts of such as feared €rod, 
'* lest haply they should or had run in vaLn." The subject^ 
then, being canvassed in frequent chapters, ended by bring- 
ing over the abbat himself to the opinion that all superfluous 
matters should be passed by, and merely the essence of the 
rule be scrutinized. Two of the fraternity, therefore, of 
equal faith and learning, were elected, who, by vicarious ex- 
amination, were to discover the intention of the founder's 
rule ; and when they had discovered it) to propound it to the 
rest. The abbat diUgently endeavoured to induce the whole 
convent to give their concurrence, but " as it is difficult to 
eradicate from men's minds, what has early taken root, since 
they reluctantly relinquish the first notions they have im- 
bibed," almost the whole of them refused to accept the new 
regulations, because they were attached to the old. Eighteen 
only, among whom was Harding, otherwise called Stephen, 
persevering in their holy determination, together with their 
abbat, left the monastery, declaring that the purity of the 



A,9, UOO.] OF TBS aSTSBTIAN OEDSB. 349 

institution could not be preserved in a place where riches 
and gluttonj warred against even the heart that was well in- 
clined. Thej came therefore to Citeaux; a situation for- 
merly covered with woods, but now so conspicuous from the 
abundant pietj of its monks, that it is not undeservedly 
esteemed conscious of the Divinity himself. Here, by the 
countenance of the archbishop of Yienne, who is now pope, 
they entered on a labour worthy to be remembered and vene- 
rated to the end of time. 

Certainly many of their regulations seem severe, and more 
particularly these: they wear nothing made with furs or 
linen, nor even that finely spun linen garment, which we 
call Staminium;* neither breeches, unless when sent on a 
journey, which at their return they wash and restore. They 
have two tunics with cowls, but no additional garment in win- 
ter, though, if they think fit, in smnmer they may lighten their 
garb. They sleep clad and girded, and never after matins 
return to their beds : but they so order the time of matins 
that it shall be light ere the lauds f begin ; so intent are they 
on their rule, that they think no jot or tittle of it should be 
disregarded. Directly after these hymns they sing the 
prime, after which they go out to work for stated hours. 
They complete whatever labour or service they have to per- 
form by day without any other light No one is ever absent 
from the daUy services, or &om complines, except the sick. 
The cellarer and hospitaller, after complines, wait upon the 
guests, yet observing the strictest silence. The abbat allows 
himself no indulgence beyond the others,— every where pre- 
sent, — rcvery where attending to his flock; except that he 
does not eat with the rest, because his table is with the 
strangers and the poor. Nevertheless, be he where he may, 
he is equally sparing of food and of speech ; for never more 
than two dishes are served either to him or to his company ; lard 
and meat never but to the sick. From the Ides of Septem- 
ber till Easter, through regard for whatever festival, they do 
not take more than one meal a day, except on Sunday. They 
never "^e^ leave the cloister but for the purpose of labour, 
nor do they ever speak, either there or elsewhere, save only 
to the abbat or prior. They pay unwearied attention to the

canonical* services, making no addition to them except the 
vigil for the defunct Thej use in their divine service the 
Ambrosian chants f and hymns, as far as thej were able to 
learn them at Milan. Wlule thej bestow care on the stran- 
ger and the sick, thej inflict intolerable mortifications on 
their own bodies, for the health of their souls. 

The abbat, at first, both encountered these privations with 
much alacrity himself, and compelled the rest to do the same. 
In process of time, however, the man repented ;f he had 
been delicately brought up, and could not well bear such 
continued scantiness of diet. The monks, whom he had left 
at Molesmes, getting scent of this disposition, either by mes- 
sages or letters, for it is uncertain which, drew him back to 
the monastery, by his obedience to the pope, for such was 
their pretext : compelling him to a measure to which he waa 
already extremely well-disposed. For, as if wearied out 
by the pertinacity of their entreaties, he left the narrow 
confines of poverty, and resought his former magnificence. 
All followed him ftt)m Citeaux, who had gone thither with 
him, except eight These, few in number but great in virtue, 
appointed Alberic, one of their party, abbat, and Stephen 
prior. The former not surviving more than eight years was^ 
at the will of heaven, happily called away. Then, doubt- 
less by Grod's appointment, Stephen though absent waa 
elected abbat ; the original contriver of the whole scheme ; 
the especial and celebrated ornament of our times. Sixteen 
abbeyB which he has already completed, and seven which he 
has begun, are sufficient testimonies of his abundant merit 
Thus, by the resounding trumpet of God, he directs the 
people around him, both by word and deed, to heaven ; act- 
ing fully up to his own precepts ; afiable in speech, pleasant 
in look, and with a mind always rejoicing in the Lord.

Hence, openlji that noble joj of countenance; henoe^ 
secretlj, that compunction, coming from above ; because, 
despising this state of a sojourner, he constantly desires to 
be in a place of rest. For these causes he is beloved by all ; 
** For God graciouslj imparts to the minds of other men a 
love for that man whom he loves.** Wherefore the inhabit- 
ant of that country esteems himself happy if, through his 
hands, he can transmit his wealth to God. He receives 
much, indeed, but expending little on his own wants, or 
those of his flock, he distributes the rest to the poor, or em- 
ploys it immediately on the building of monasteries ; for the 
purse of Stephen is ihe public treasury of the indigent. A proof 
of his abstinence is that you see nothing there, as in other 
monasteries, flaming with gold, blazing with jewels, or glit- 
tering with silver. For as a Gentile says, *' Of what use is 
gold to a saint ?" We think it not enough in our holy vases, 
unless the ponderous metal be eclipsed by precious stones ; 
by the flame of the topaz, the violet of the amethyst, and 
the green shade of the emerald : unless the sacerdotal robes 
wanton with gold ; and unless the walls glisten with various 
coloured paintings, and throw the reflexion of the sun's rays 
upon the ceiling. These men, however, placing those things 
which mortals foolishly esteem the first, only in a secondary 
point of view, give all their diligence to improve their morals, 
and love pure minds, more than glittering vestments ; knowing 
that the best remuneration for doing well, is to enjoy a dear 
conscience. Moreover, if at any time the laudable kindness 
of the abbat either desires, or feigns a desire, to modify 
aught from the strict letter of the rule, they are ready to 
oppose such indulgence, saying, that they have no long time 
to live, nor shall they continue to exist so long as they have 
already done ; that they hope to remain stedfast in their pur 
pose to the end, and to be an example to their successors, 
who will transgress if they should give way. And, indeed, 
through human weakness, the perpetual law of whidi is that 
nothing attained, even by the greatest labour, can long re- 
main unchanged, it will be so. But to comprise, briefly, all 
things which are or can be said of them, — ^the Cistertian 
monks at the present day are a model for all monks, a mirror 
for the diligent, a spur to the indolent 

At this time three sees in England were transferred from 



362 wnxiAic of icalmesburt* Is.it.cl 

their ancient situations ; Wells to Bath, hj John ; Chester to 
Coventry, by Eobert; Thetford to Norwich, by Herbert; all 
through greater ambition, than ought to have influenced men 
of such eminence. Finally, to speak of the last first : Herbert, 
from his skill in adulation, sumamed Losinga,* was first abbat 
of Ramsey, and then purchased the bishopric of Thetford, 
while his father, Eobert, sumamed as himself was intruded 
on the abbey of Winchester. This man, then, was the great 
source of simony in England; having craftily procured by 
means of his wealth, both an abbey and a bishopric. For 
he hood-winked the king's solicitude for the church by his 
money, and whispered great promises to secure the fiivonr 
of the nobility: whence a poet of those times admirably 
observes, 

'^ A monster in the church firom Losing rose, 
Baae Simon's sect, the canons to oppose. 
Peter, thou*rt slow; see Simon soars on high; 
If present, soon thou'd'st hurl him from tiie skj.f 
Oh grief, tiie church is let to sordid hire. 
The son a bishop, abbat is the sire. 
All may be hoped from gold's prevailing sway, 
Which gOTcms all things; gives and takes away; 
Makes bishops, abbats, basely in a day." 

Future repentance, however, atoned for the errors of his 
youth: he went to Home, when he was of a more serious 
age, and there resigning the staff and ring which he bad 
acquired by simony, had them restored through the indulg- 
ence of that most merciful see; for the Eomans regard it 
both as more holy and more fitting, that the dues from each 
church should rather come into their own purse, than be 
subservient to the use of any king whatever. Herbert thus 
returning home, removed the episcopal see, which had for- 
merly been at Helmham, and was then at Thetford, to a 
town, celebrated for its trade and populousness, called Nor- 
wich. Here he settled a congregation of monks, famous for 
their numbers and their morals ; purchasing everything for 
them out of his private fortune. For, having an eye to the 
probable complaints of his successors, he gave none of the

epiBeopal lands to the monastery, lest they should deprive 
the servants of Grod of their subsistence, if they found any 
thing given to them which pertained to their see. At Thet- 
ford, too^ he settled Clugniac monks» because the members 
of that order, dispersed throughout the world, are rich in 
worldly possessions^ and of dbtinguished piety towards God. 
Thus, by the great and extensive merit of his virtues, he 
shrouded the multitude of his former failings; and by his 
abundant eloquence and learning, as well as by his know- 
ledge in secular affidrs, he became worthy even of the Bo- 
man pontificate. Herbert thus changed, as Lucan obsehres 
of Curio^ became the changer and mover of all things ; and^ 
as in the times of this king, he had been a pleader in behalf 
of simony, so was he, afterwards, its most strenuous opposer ; 
nor did he suffer that to be done by others, which he la- 
mented he had ever himself done through the presumption 
of juvenile ardour : ever having in his mouth, as they relate, 
the saying of St Jerome, '* We have erred when young ; let 
us amend now we are old." Finally, who can sufficiently 
extol his conduct, who, though not a very rich bishop, yet 
built so noble a monastery ; in which nothing appears defec- 
tive, either in the beauty of the lofty edifice, the elegance of 
its ornaments, or in the piety and univeroEd charity of its 
monks. These things soothed him with joyful hope while 
he lived, and when dead, if repentance be not in vain, con- 
ducted him to heaven.* 

John was bishop of Wells ; a native of Touraine, and an 
approved physician, by practice, rather than education. On 
the death of the abbat of Bath, he easily obtained the abbey 
from the king, both because all things at court were exposed 
to sale, and his covetousness seemed palliated by some de- 
gree of reason, that so famed a city might be still more 
celebrated, by becoming the see of a bishop. He at first 
1)^;an to exercise his severity against the monks, because 
.ihej were dull, and in his estimation, barbarians; taking 
away all the lands ministering to their subsistence, and 
furnishing them with but scanty provision by his lay de- 
.pendants. In process of time, however, when new monks

had been admitted, he condacted himself with more mild- 
ness; and gave a small portion of land to the pnor, hj 
which he mighty in some measure, support himself and his 
inmates. And although he had begun austerely, yet manj 
things were there bj him both noblj begun and completed, 
in decorations and in books ; and more especially, in a selec- 
tion of monks, equally notable for their learning and kind 
offices. But still he could not, even at his death, be softened 
far enough totally to exonerate the lands finom bondage; 
leaving, in this respect, an example not to be followed by 
his successors. 

There was in the diocese of Chester, a monastery, called 
Coyentry, which, as I have before related, the most noble 
earl Leofric, widi his lady Godiva, had built; so splendid 
for its gold and silver, that the very walls of the church 
seemed too scanty to receive the treasures, to the great 
astonishment of the beholders. This, Robert bish<^ of the 
diocese ei^erly seized on, in a manner by no means epis- 
copal ; stealing from the very treasures of the church where- 
with he might fill the hand of the king, b^uile the vigilance 
of the pope, and gratify the covetousness of the Romans. 
Continuing there many years, he gave no proof of worth 
whatever: for, so far firom rescuing the nodding roofs from 
ruin, he wasted the sacred treasures, and became guilty of 
peculation ; and a bishop might have been convicted of 0- 
legal exactions, had an accuser been at hand. He fed the 
monks on miserable fare, made no attempts to excite in them 
a love for their profession, and suffered them to reach only 
a very common degree of learning; lest he should make 
them delicate by sumptuous living, or strictness of rule 
and depth of learning should spirit them up to oppose 
him. Contented therefore with rustic fare, and humble 
literary attainments, they deemed it enough, if they could 
only live in peace. Moreover, at his death, paying little 
attention to the dictates of the canons, by which it is 
enacted, that bishops ought to be buried in their cathe- 
drals, he commanded himself to be interred, not at Chester, 
but at Coventry; leaving to his successors by such a de- 
cision, the task, not of claiming what was not due to them, 
but as it were, of vindicating their proper right

induced to relate the translation of the most excellent Augas- 
tine, the apostle of the English and of his companions, had 
not the talents of the learned Josceljn, anticipated me :* of 
Josceljn, who being a monk of St. Bertin, formerly came 
to England with Herman bishop of Salisbury, skilled equally 
in literature and music. For a considerable time he visited 
the cathedrals and abbeys, and left proofs of uncommon 
learning in many places ; he was second to none after Bede 
in the celebration of the English saints ; next to Osbemef 
too^ he bore away the palm in music. Moreover he wrote 
innumerable lives of modem saints, and restored, in an ele- 
gant manner, such of those of the ancients as had been lost 
through the confusion of the times, or had been carelessly 
edited. He also so exquisitely wrought the process of this 
translation, that he may be said to have realized it to the 
present race, and given a view of it to posterity. Happy 
that tcmgue, which ministered to so many saints ! happy that 
▼oice, which poured forth such melody ! more especially as 
in his life, his probity equalled his learning. But, as I have 
hitherto recorded disgraceful transactions of certain bishops, 
I will introduce others of different lives and dispositions^ 
who were in being at the same time ; that our age may not 
be said to have grown so negligent as not to produce one 
single saint Such as are desirous, may find this promise 
completed in a subsequent book, after the narrative of king 
Henry's transactions.

acqtudnted with these matters, and meets with iMs work, 
msLj have something to communicate to others. But for 
sach a relation there needs a more fenrent spirit, m order 
to complete effectnaQj, what I b^in^rith such pleasure. 
Invoking, therefore, the Divinity, as #asua], I b^ as 
follows. 

In the jear of the incarnation 1095, pope Urban the 
second, who then filled the papal throne, passing the Alps, 
came into France. The ostensible cause of his journey, was, 
that, being driven from home hj fhe violence <;f Goitert, ^ 
might prevail on the churches on this side of the mountains to 
acknowledge him. His more secret intention was not so weU 
known ; this was, bj Boamund's advice, to excite almost the 
whole of Europe to undertake an expedition into Asia ; that 
in such a general commotion of aJil countries^ auxiliaries 
might easily be engaged, by whose means both Urban might 
obtain Rome; and Boamund, Dlyria and Ilflacedonia. For 
Guiscard, his father, had conquered those countries from 
Alexius, and also all the territoiy extending from Durazzo 
to Thessalonica ; wherefore Boamund claimed them as his 
due, since he obtained not the inheritance of Apulia, which 
his father had given to his younger son, Roger. Still 
nevertheless, whatever might be the cause of Urban's journey, 
it turned out of great and singular advantage to the Christian 
world. A council, therefore, was assembled at Clermont,* 
which is the most noted city of Auvergne. The number of 
bishops and abbats was three hundred and ten. Here at

the snake of simonj had so reared her slippery crest, and 
oherishedy with poisonous warmth, her deadly eggs, that the 
whole world became infected with her mortal hbsing, and 
tainted the honoui^lf the church. At that time, I vnR not 
saj bishops to their sees merely, but none aspired even to 
any ecclesiastical degree, except by the influence of money. 
Then too, many persons putting away their lawful wives, 
procured divorces, and invaded the marriage-couch of others. 
Wherefore, as in both these cases, there was a mixed multi- 
tude of offenders, the names of some powerful persons were 
singled out for punishment. Not to be tedious, I will sub- 
join the result of the whole council, abbreviating some parts, 
in my own language. 

In a council at Clermont, in the presence of pope Urban, 
these articles were enacted. ^' That the catholic church 
shall be pure in faith ; free from all servitude : that bishops, 
or abbats, or clergy of any rank, shall receive no ecclesiasti- 
cal dignity from the hand of princes, or of any of the laity : 
that clergymen shall not hold prebends in two churches or 
cities : ^at no one shall be bishop and abbat at the same 
time : that ecclesiastical dignities shall be bought ^nd sold 
by no one : that no person in holy orders shall be guilty of 
carnal intercourse : that such as not knowing the canonical 
prohibition had purchased canonries, should be pardoned : 
but that they should be taken from such as knew they pos- 
sesed them by their own purchase, or that of their parents : 
that no layman from Ash- Wednesday, no clergyman from 
Quadragesima, to Easter, shall eat flesh : that, at all times, 
the first £Eist of the Ember Weeks, should be in the first 
week of Lent : that orders should be conferred, at all times, 
on the evening of Saturday, or on a Sunday, continuing fast- 
ing :* that on Easter-eve, service should not be celebrated 
tiU after the ninth hour : that the second fast should be 
observed in the week of Pentecost : that from our Lord's 
Advent, to the octave of the Epiphany ; from Septuagesima 
to the octaves of Easter ; from the first day of the Rogations 

* If orden could not be completely conferred on Saturdftj, the cere- 
mony might be performed on Sunday ; and the partiefl continuing to fast 
the two days were considered as one only.^-DcTBiND.

to the octaves of Pentecost ; and from the fourth day of the 
week at sunset, at all times, to the second daj in the follow- 
ing week at sunrise, the Truce of God be observed :* that 
whoever laid violent hands on a bishop should be excommu- 
nicated : that whoever laid violent hands on clergymen or 
their servants should be accursed : that whoever seized the 
goods of bishops or clergymen at their deaths, should be 
accursed : that whoever married a relation, even in the sixth 
degree of consanguinity, should be accursed : that none 
should be chosen bishop, except a priest, deacon, or sub- 
deacon who was of noble descent, unless under pressing 
necessity, and licence from the pope : that the sons cS priests 
and concubines should not be advanced to the priesthood, 
unless they first made their vow : that whosoever fled to the 
church, or the cross, should, being insured from loss of limb, 
be delivered up to justice ; or if innocent, be released : that 
every church should ei^goy its own tithes, nor pass them 
away to another : that laymen should neither buy nor sell 
tithes ; that no fee should be demanded for the burial of the 
dead. In this council the pope excommunicated Philip, king 
of France, and all who called him king or lord, and obeyed 
or spoke to him, unless for the purpose of correcting him : in 
like manner too his accursed consort, and all who called her 
queen or lady, till they so far reformed as to separate from 
each other : and also Guibert of Ravenna, who calls him- 
self pope : and Henry, emperor of Germany, who supports 
him,^ 

^Afterwards, a clear and forcible discourse, such as should 
come from a priest, was addressed to the people, on the sub- 
ject of an expedition of the Christians, against the Turks. 
This I have thought fit to transmit to posterity, as I have 
learned it from those who were present, preserving its 
sense unimpaired. For who can preserve the force of 
that eloquence? We shall be fortunate, if, treading an 
adjacent path, we come even by a circuitous route to its 
meaning. 

* The Truce of God, was so called from the eageraeas with which h* 
first proposal was received by the suffering people of every degree : dorixig 
the time it endured, no one dared infringe it, by attacking his fellows. See 
Du Cange : and Robertson's Charles V. vol. i. It was blamed by boiim 
bishops as ftimishing an occasion of peijury, and was rejected by the Nor^

**Tou recollect,*'* said he, "my dearest brethren, many 

things which have been decreed for 70a, at this time ; some 

matters, in our council, commanded ; others inhibited. A 

rude and confused chaos of crimes required the deliberation 

of many dajs ; an inveterate maladj demanded a sharp 

remedy. For while we give unbounded scope to our 

clemency, our papal office finds numberless matters to 

proscribe; none to spare. But it has hitherto arisen 

from human frailty, that you have erred, and that, 

deceived by the speciousness of vice, you have exasperated 

the long suffering of God, by too lightly regarding his 

forbearance. It has arisen too from human wantonness, 

that, disregarding lawful wedlock, you have not duly 

considered the heinousness of adultery. From too great 

covetousness also, it has arisen, that, as opportunity offered, 

making captive your brethren, bought by the same great 

price, you have outrageously extorted from them their 

wealth. To you, however, now suffering this perilous 

shipwreck of sin, a secure haven of rest is offered, 

unless you neglect it A station of perpetual safety will 

be awarded you, for the exertion of a trifling labour against 

the Turks. Compare, now,-tfae iabonr? which you underwent 

in the practice of wickedness, and those which you will 

encounter in the undertaking I advise. The intention of 

committing adultery, or murder, begets many fears ; for, as 

Soloman says, ' There is nothing more timid than guilt : ' 

many labours ; for what is more toilsome than wickedness ? 

But, 'He who walks uprightly, walks securely.' Of these 

labours, of these fears, the end was sin ; the wages of sin is 

death ; the death of sinners is most dreadful. Now the same 

labours and apprehensions are required from you, for a better 

consideration. The cause of these labours, will be charity ; 

if thus warned by the command of Grod, you lay down your 

lives for the brethren : the wages of charity wiU be the grace 

of God ; the grace of God is followed by eternal life. Go 

then prosperously : Go, then, with confidence, to attack the 

enemies of God. For they long since, oh sad reproach to 

Bwns, as rrnitmry to their privileges. The Trace of God was fint esta-

Christians ! have seized Syria, Armeiiia» and lastly, all Asia 
Minor, the provinces of which are Bithjnia, Fhrygia, 
Gralatia, Ljdia, Caria, Famphjlia, Isauria, Ljcia, Cilicia; 
and, now they insolently domineer over lUyricum, and all 
the hither countries, even to the sea which is called the 
Straits of St G^rge. Nay, they usurp even the sepulchre 
of our Lord, that singular assurance of our £uth ; and sell 
to our pilgrims admissions to that city, which ought, had 
they a trace of their ancient courage lefi^ to be open to 
Christians only. This alone might be enough to cloud our 
brows ; but now, who except the most abandoned, or the 
most envious of Christian reputation, can endure that we do 
not divide the world equally with them ? They inhabit Asia, 
the third portion of the world, as their native soil, which was 
justly esteemed by our ancestors equal, by the extent of its 
tracts and greatness of its provinces, to the two remaining 
parts. There, formerly, sprang up the first germs of our 
fiuth ; there, all the apostles, except two, consecrated their 
deaths ; there, at the present day, the Christians, if any 
survive, sustaining life by a wretched kind of agriculture^ 
pay these miscreants tribute, and even with stifled sighs, 
long for the participation of your liberty, since they have 
lost their own. They hold Aj&ica also, another quarter of 
the world, already possessed by their arms for more than 
two hundred years ; which on this account I pronounce 
derogatory to Christian honour, because that country was 
anciently the nurse of celebrated geniuses, who, by their 
divine writings, Will mock the rust of antiquity as long as 
there shall be a person who can relish Boman literature : * 
the learned know the truth of what I say. Europe^ the 
third portion of the world remains ; of which, how small a 
part do we Christians inhabit ? for who can call all those 
barbarians who dwell in remote islands of the Frozen Ocean, 
Christians, since they live after a savage manner ? Even 
this small portion of the world, belonging to us, is oppressed 
by the Turks and Saracens. Thus for three hundred years, 
Spain and the Balearic isles have been subjugated to them, 
and the possession of the remainder is eagerly anticipated 
by feeble men, who, not having courage to engage in dose 
encounter, love a flying mode of wariare. For the Turk

never ventares upon close fight ; but^ when dnven from his 
station, bends his bow at a distance, and trusts the winds 
with his meditated wound ; and as he has poisoned arrows^ 
venom, and not valour, inflicts the death on the man he 
strikes. Whatever he effects, then, I attribute to fortune, 
not to courage, because he wars bj flight, and bj poison* It 
is apparent too^ that every race, bom in that region, being 
scorched with the intense heat of the sun, abounds more in 
reflexion, than in blood ; and, therefore, they avoid coming 
to close quarters, because they are aware how little blood 
they possess. Whereas the people who are bom amid the 
polar frosts, and distant firom the sun's heat, are less cautious 
indeed j but, elate from their copious and luxuriant flow of 
blood, they flght with the greatest alacrity. You are a nation 
born in the more temperate regions of the world ; who may 
be both prodigal of blood, in defiance of death and wounds ; 
and are not deficient in prudence. For you equally preserve 
good conduct in camp, and are considerate in batde. Thus- 
endued with skill and with valour, you undertake a memora- 
ble expedition. You will be extolled throughout aU ages, if 
you rescue your brethren from danger. To those present, in 
Grod's name, I command this ; to the absent I enjoin it. Let 
such as are going to fight for Christianity, put the form of 
the cross upon their garments, that they may, outwardly, 
d^nonstrate the love arising from their inward faith ; 
enjoying by the gift of God, and the privilege of St. Peter, 
absolution from all their crimes : let this in the meantime 
soothe the labour of their journey ; satisfied that they shall 
obtain, after death, the advantages of a blessed martyrdom. 
Putting an end to your crimes then, that Christians may 
at least live peaceably in these countries, go> and employ in 
nobler warfare, that valour, and that sagacity, which you 
used to waste in civil broils : Go, soldiers every where 
renowned in fame, go, and subdue these dastardly nations. 
Let the noted vsdour of the French advance, which, 
accompanied by its adjoining nations, shall affiright the 
whole world by the single terror of its name. But why do 
I delay you longer by detracting from the courage of the 
gentiles ? Rather bring to your recollection the saying of 
God, ' Narrow is the way which leadeth to life.' Be it so 
then : the track to be followed is narrow, replete with deaths

and terrible with dangers ; still this path will lead to your 
lost country. No doubt you must, <by much tribulation 
enter into the kingdom of God.' Place then, before your 
imagination, if you shall be made captive, torments and 
chains ; nay, every possible suffering that can be inflicted. 
Expect, for the firmness of your faith, even horrible punish- 
ments ; that so, if it be necessary, you may redeem yoor 
souls at the expense of your bodies. Do you fear death ? 
you men of exemplary courage and intrepidity. Surely 
human wickedness can devise nothing against you, worthy 
to be put in competition with heavenly glory : for the 
sufferings of the present time are not worthy to be compared 
* to the glory which shall be revealed in us.' Know ye not, 
^that for men to live is wretchedness, and happiness to 
die ? ' This doctrine, if you remember, you imbibed with 
your mother's milk, through the preaching of the clergy : 
and this doctrine your ancestors, the martyrs, held out by 
example. Death sets free from its filthy prison the human 
soul, which then takes flight for the mansions fltted to its 
virtues. Death accelerates their country to the good : death 
cuts short the wickedness of the ungodly. By means of 
death, then, the soul, made free, is either soothed with joyful 
hope, or is punished without farther apprehension of worse. 
So long as it is fettered to the body, it derives from it 
earthly contagion ; or to say more truly, is dead. For, 
earthly with heavenly, and divine with mortal, ill agree. 
The soul, indeed, even now, in its state of union with the 
body, is capable of great efforts ; it gives life to its instru- 
ment^ secretly moving and animating it to exertions almost 
beyond mortal nature. But when, freed from the clog which 
drags it to the earth, it regains its proper station, it partakes 
of a blessed and perfect energy, communicating after some 
measure with the invisibility of the divine nature. Dis- 
charging a double office, therefore, it ministers life to the 
body when it is present, and the cause of its change, when 
it departs. You must observe how pleasantly the soul wakes 
in the sleeping body, and, apart from the senses, sees many 
future events, from the principle of its relationship to the 
Deity. Why then do ye fear death, who love the repose of 
sleep, which resembles death ? Surely it must be madness, 
through lust of a transitory life, to deny yourselves that

which IB etemaL Rather, my dearest brethren, should it so 
happen, lay down your lives for the brotherhood. Rid Grod's 
sanctuary of the wicked : expel the robbers : bring in the 
pious. Let no love of relations detain you ; for man's 
chiefest love is towards Grod. Let no attachment to your 
native soil be an impediment; because, in different points 
of view, all the world is exile to the Christian, and all the 
world his country. Thus exile is his country, and his 
country exile. Let none be restrained from going by the 
largeness of his patrimony, for a still larger is promised 
him ; not of such things as soothe the miserable with vain 
expectation, or flatter the indolent disposition with the mean 
advantages of wealth, but of such as are shewn by perpetual 
•xample and approved by daily experience. Yet these too 
are pleasant, but vain, and which, to such as despise them, 
produce reward a hundred-fold. These things I publish, 
these I command : and for their execution I fix the end of 
the ensuing spring. God will be gracious to those who 
undertake this expedition, that they may have a favourable 
year, both in abundance of produce, and in serenity of 
season. Those who may die will enter the mansions of 
heaven ; while the living shall behold the sepulchre of the 
Lord. And what can be greater happiness, than for a man, 
in his life-lime, to see those places, where the Lord of 
heaven was conversant as a man ? Blessed are they, who, 
called to these occupations, shall inherit such a recompence : 
fortunate are those who are led to such a conflict, that they 
may partake of such rewards." 

I have adhered to the tenor of this address, retaining 
some few things unaltered, on account of the truth of the re- 
marks, but omitting many. The bulk of the auditors were 
extremely excited, and attested their sentiments by a shout ; 
pleased with the speech, and inclined to the pilgrimage. And 
immediately, in presence of the council, some of the nobility, 
falling down at the knees of the pope, consecrated themselves 
and their property to the service of Grod. Among these was 
Aimar, the very powerful bishop of Puy, who afterwards 
ruled the army by his prudence, and augmented it through 
his eloquence. In the month of November, then, in which 
this council was held, each departed to his home : and the 
report of this good resolutioA soon becoming general, it

gently wafted a cheering gale oyer the minds of the Chris* 
tians : which heing uniyersallj diffused, there was no nation 
so remote, no people so retired, as not to contribute its por- 
tion. This ardent love not only inspired the continental 
provinces, but eyen all who had heard the name of Christ, 
whether in the most distant islands, or savage countries. 
' The Welshman left his hunting ; the Scot his fellowship with 
I ^ lice ;* the Dane his drinking party ; the Norw^ian his raw 
I fish. Lands were deserted oi their husbandmen ; houses of 

their inhabitants ; even whole cities migrated. There was 
; no regard to relationship ; affection to their country was 
held in little esteem ; Gkid alone was placed before their eyes. 
Whatever was stored in granaries, or hoarded in chambers, 
to answer the hopes of the avaricious husbandman, or the 
covetousness of the miser, all, all was deserted ; they htm- 
gered and thirsted after Jerusalem alone. Joy attended such 
as proceeded ; while grief oppressed those who remained. 
But why do I say remained? You might see the husband 
departing with his wife, indeed, with all his family ; you 
would smile to see the whole household laden on a carriage, 
about to proceed on their journey.t The road was too nar- 
row for the passengers, the path too confined for the travel- 
lers, so thickly were they thronged with endless multitudes. 
The number surpassed all human imagination, though the 
itinerants were estimated at six millions.} Doubtless, never 
did so many nations unite in one opinion ; never did so im- 
mense a population subject their unruly passions to one, and 
almost to no, direction.y For the strangest wonder to behold 
was, that such a countless multitude marched gradually 
through various Christian countries without plundering, 
though there was none to restrain them. Mutual i^egard

blazed forth in all ; so that if anj one found in his possession 
what he knew did not belong to him, he exposed it every- 
where for several days to be owned ; and the desire of the 
finder was suspended, till perchance the wants of the loser 
might be repaired.* 

The long-looked for month of March was now at hand, 
when, the hoary garb of winter being laid aside, the world, 
dad in vernal bloom, invited the pilgrims to the confines of 
the east ; nor, such was the ardour of their minds, did they 
seek delay. Godfre y, duke of Lorraine, proceeded by way of * 
Hungary : second tottoue hi llfiUlary virtue, and, descended ' 
from the ancient lineage of Charles the Great^ he inherited 
much of Charles both in blood and in mind. He was fol- 
lowed by the Frisons, Lorrainers, Saxons, and all the people 
who dwell between the Rhine and the G«ronne.| ^aimund, 
earl of St. Giles, and Aimar, bishop of Puy, nobly matched 
in valour, and alike noted for spirit against the enemy and 
piety to Grod, took the route of DaJmatia. Under their 
standard marched the Goths and Gascons, and all the people 
Bcattered throughout the Pyrenees and the Alps. Before 
them, by a shorter route, went Boamund, an Apulian by 
residence, but a Norman by descent For embarking at 
Brindisi, and landing at Durazzo, he marched to Constanti- 
nople by roads with which he was well acquainted. Under 
his command, Italy, and the whole adjacent province, from 
the Tuscan sea to the Adriatic, joined in the war. All these 
assembling at the same time at Constantinople, partook some- 
what of mutual joy. Here, too, they found Hugh the Great^ 
brother of JPhilip, king of France : for having inconsiderately, 
and with a few soldiers, entered the territories of the empe- 
ror, he was taken by his troops, and detained in free custody. 
But Alexius, emperor of Constantinople, alarmed at the arri- 
val of these chiefs, willingly, but, as it were, induced by their 
entreaties, released him. Alexius was a man famed for his 
duplicity, and never attempted any thing of importance, 
nnless by stratagem. He had taken off Guiscard, as I before

related, by poisoD, and had oormpted his wife by gold; 
falsely promising by his emissaries to marry her. Again, 
too^ he allowed William, earl of Poitoo, to be led into an 
ambush of the Turks, and, after losing sixty thousand sol- 
diers, to escape almost unattended ; being incensed at his 
reply, when he refused homage to the Greek. In after time^ 
he laid repeated snares for Boamund, who was marching 
against him to avenge the injuries of the crusaders ; and 
when these failed he bereaved him of his brother Guido^ and 
of almost all his army ; making use of his usual arts either 
in poisoning the rivers, or their garments : but of this here- 
after. Now, however, removing the army hx>m the city, and 
mildly addressing the chiefs, lus Grecian eloquence proved 
so powerful, that he obtained from them all homage, and an 
oath, that they would form no plot against him ; and that if 
they could subdue the cities pertaining to his empire, they 
would restore them to him, thus purchasing another's advan- 
tage at the expense of their own blood. The credit of main- 
taining his liberty appeared more estimable to Raimund 
alone ; so that he neither did homage to him, nor took the 
oath. Ck)llecting, then, all their forces, they made an attack 
on Nicea, a city of Bithynia : for they chose to assault this 
first, both as it was an obstacle to the crusaders, and as they 
were eager to revenge the death of those pilgrims who had 
recently been slain there. For one Walter, a distinguished 
soldier, but precipitate, (for you will scarcely see prudence 
and valour united in the same person, as one retards wbal 
the other advances,) incautiously roaming around the walls^ 
had perished with a numerous party, which Peter the hermit 
had allured, by his preaching, from their country. 

Now, too, in the month of September, Robert earl cf 
Normandy, brother of king William whose name is prefixed 
to this book, earnestly desiring to enter on the expedition, 
had as his companions Robert of Flanders, and Stephen of 
Blois who had married his sister. They were earls of noble 
lineage and corresponding valour. Under their command 
were the English and Normans, the Western Franks and 
people of Flanders, and all the tribes which occupy the con- 
tinental tract from the British Ocean to the Alps. Proceed- 
ing on their journey, at Lucca they found pope Urban, who 
being enraged at Guibert, as I have said, was, by the assist-

ance of Matilda, carrying war into Italj and around the city 
of Rome. He had now so far succeeded that the Roman 
people, inclining to his party, were harassing that of Guibert, 
both by words and blows ; nor did the one faction spare the 
other, either in the churches or in the streets, until Guibert^ 
being weakest, left the see vacant for Urban, and fled to 
Germany. 

Of Rome, formerly the mistress of the globe, but which 
now, in comparison of its ancient state, appears a small 
town ; and of the Romans, once '' Sovereigns over all and the 
gowned nation,"* who are now the most fickle of men, bar- 
tering justice for gold, and dispensing with the canons for 
money; of this city and its inhabitants, I say, whatever I 
might attempt to write, has been anticipated by the verses 
of Hildebert, first, bishop of Mans, and afterwards archbishop 
of Tours.t YiThich I insert, not to assume the honour 
acquired by another man's labour, but rather as a proof of a

tude of its sacred relics ; and that no person may complain 
of his being deprived of any knowledge by the obscurity of 
the narrative, the description shall run in an easy and fami- 
liar style.* 

The first is the Cornelian gate, which is now called the 
gate of St. Peter, and the Cornelian way. Near it is situ- 
ated the church of St. Peter, in which his body lies» decked 
with gold and silver, and precious stones : and no one knows 
the number of the holy martyrs who rest in that church. On 
the same way is another church, in which lie the boly 
virgins Rufina and Secunda. In a third church, are Marius 
and Martha, and Audifisix and Abacuc, their sons. 

The second is the Flaminian gate, which is now called the 
gate of St. Valentine,! and the Flaminian way, and when it 
arrives at the Milvian bridge, it takes the name of the Ba- 
vennanian way, because it leads to Ravenna; and ihestey at 
the first stone without the gate, St Valentine rests in bia 
church. 

The third is called the Porcinian:^ gate, and the way the

same ; but where it joins the Salarian, it loses its name, and 
there, nearly in the spot which is called Cucumeris, lie the 
martyrs, Festus, Johannes, Liberalis, Diogenes, Blastus, Lu- 
cina, and in one sepulchre, the Two Hundred and Sixty,* in 
another, the Thirty. 

The fourth is the Salarian f gate and way; now called St 
Silvester's. Here, near the road, lie St Hermes, and St 
Vasella, and Prothus, and Jacinctus, Ma-rilmn^ Herculai^ 
Crispus ; and, in another place, hard by, rest the holy mar« 
tyrs Pamphilus and Quirinus, seventy steps beneath the sur- 
face. Next is the church of St Felicity, where she rests, 
and Silanus her son ; and not far distant, Boniface the mar- 
tyr. In another church, there are Crisantus, and Daria, 
and Satuminus, and Maurus, and Jason, and their mother 
Hilaria, and others innumerable. And in another church, 
St Alexander, Yitalis, Martialis, sons of St. Felicity; and 
seven holy virgins, Satumina, Hilarina, Duranda, Bogan- 
tina, Serotina, Paulina, Donata. Next the church of St 
Silvester, where he lies under a marble tomb; and the 
martyrs, Celestinus, Philippus, and Felix; and there too^ 
the Three Hundred and Sixty-five martyrs rest in one 
sepulchre; and near them lie Paulus and Crescentianus, 
Pxisca and Semetrius, Praxides and Potentiana. 

The fifth is called the Numentan;^ gate. There lies St 
Nicomede, priest and nuuiyr ; the way too is called by the 
same name. Near the road are the church and body of St 
Agnes ; in another church, St. Ermerenciaiia, and the 
martyrs, Alexander, Felix, Papias ; at the seventh stone on 
this road rests the holy pope Alexander, with Euentius and 
Theodolus. 

The sixth is the Tiburtine§ gate and way, which is now 
called St Lawrence^s : near tins way lies St. Lawrence in 
his church, and Habundius the martyr: and near this, in 
another church, rest these martyrs, Ciriaca, Bomanus, Justi- 
nus, Crescentianus ; and not far from hence the church of 
St Hyppolitus, where He himself rests, and his family, 
eighteen in number ; there too repose^ St Trifonia, the wife

liie seventh is called, at present, the Greater gate,* for- 
merly the Seracusan, and the way the LaTicanian, which 
leads to St. Helena. Near this are Peter, Man^llinus, 
Tybnrtius, Greminus, Gorgonius, and the Forty Soldiers,f 
and others without number; and a little farther the Four

The eighth is the gate of St. John,§ which by the an- 
cients was called Assenarica. The ninth gate is <^ed Me-

tenth is called the Latin gate^^T and way. Near this, in one 
church, lie the martyrs, Gordianus and Epimachus, Sulpi- 
ciuSy Servilianus, Quintinus, Quartus, Sophia, Triphenas. 
Near this too, in another spot, Tertullinus, and not far 
distant, the church of St Eugenia, in which she lies, and 
her mother Claudia, and pope Stephen, with nineteen of his 
clergy, and Nemesius the deacon. 

The eleventh is caUed the Appian gate** and way. There 
lie St. Sebastian, and Quirinus, and originally the bodies of 
the apostles rested there. A little nearer Bome, are the 
martyrs, Januarius, Urbanus, Xenon, Quirinus^ Agapetus, 
Felicissimus ; and in another church, Tyburtius, Yalerianus, 
Maximus. Not far distant is the church of the martyr Ce- 
cilia; and there are buried Stephanus, Sixtus, Zefferinus, 
Eusebius, Melchiades, Marcellus, Eutychianus, Dionysin^ 
Antheros, Pontianus, pope Lucius, Optadus, Julianus, Calo- 
cerus, Parthenius, Tharsidus, PoHtanus, martyrs: there too 
is the church and body of St. Cornelius: and in another 
church, St. Sotheris: and not far off, rest the martyrs,

Between the Appian and Ostiensian waj, is the Ardeatine 
way, where are St Marcus, and MarceUianus. And there 
lies pope Damasus in his church ; and near him St. Fetron- 
illa, and Nereu8> and Achilleu8> and manj more. 

The twelfth gate and way is called the Ostiensian, but, at 
present, St. Paul's,* because he lies near it in his church. 
There too is the martyr Timotheus : and near, in the church 
of St. Tecla, are the martyrs Felix, Audactus, and Neme- 
sius. At the Three Fountainsj* is the head of the martyr 
St. Anastasius. 

The thirte^ith is called the Fortuanf gate and way ; near 
which in a church are the martyrs, Felix, Alexander, Ab- 
don and Sennes, S3aneon, Anastasius, Polion, Yinoentius^ 
Milex, Candida, and Innocentia. 

The fourteenth is the Aurelian§ gate and way, which 
now is called the gate of St. Pancras, because he lies near it 
in his church, and the other martyrs, Paulinus, Arthemius, 
St Sapientia, with her three daughters. Faith, Hope, and 
Charity. In another church, Processus and Martinianus; 
and, in a third, two Felixes ; in a fourth Calixtus, and Gale- 
podius; in a fifth St BasiHdes. At the twelfth miUiaiy 
within the city, on Mount Celius, are the martyrs Johannes, 
and Paulus, in their dwelling, which was made a church 
after their martyrdom: and Crispin and Crispinianus, and 
St Benedicta. On the same mount, is the church of St. 
Stephen, the first martyr ; and there are buried the martyrs 
Primus, and FeHcianus; on Mount Aventine St Boniface; 
and on Mount Nola, St Tatiana rests. 

Such are the Roman sanctuaries ; such the sacred pledges 
upon earth : and yet in the midst of this heavenly treasure, 
as it were, a people drunk with senseless fury, even at the 
very time the crusaders arrived, were disturbing everything 
with wild ambition, and, when unable to satisfy their lust of

in Urban's benediction, having passed tbrongli Tuscany and 
Campania, came by Apulia to Calabria, and would have 
embarked immediately had not the seamen, on being con- 
sulted, forbade them, on account of the violence of the 
southerly winds. In consequence, the earls of Normandy 
and Blois passed the winter there; sojourning each among 
their friends, as convenient. The earl of Flanders, alone^ 
ventured to sea, experiencing a prosperous issue to a rash 
attempt: wherefore part of this assembled multitude re- 
turned home through want; and part of them died from 
the unwholesomeness of the climate. The earls who re- 
mained however, when by the vernal sun's return they saw 
the sea sufficiently calm for the expedition, committed them- 
selves to the ocean, and, by Christ's assistance, landed safely 
at two ports. Thence, tbrough Thessaly, the metropolis of 
which is Thessalonica, and Thracia, they came to Constan- 
tinople. Many of the lower order perished on the march 
through disease and want ; many lost their lives at the De- 
vil's Ford, as it is called from its rapidity ; and more indeed 
would have perished, had not the advanced cavalry been 
stationed in tiie river, to break the violence of the current ; 
by which means the lives of some were saved, and the rest 
passed over on horseback. The whole multitude then, to 
solace themselves for their past labours, indulged in rest 
for fifteen days, pitching their camp in the suburbs of the 
city ; of which, as the opportunity has presented itself^ I 
shall briefly speak. 

Constantinople was first called Byzantium : which name is 
stiU preserved by the imperial money called Beseants. St. 
Aldhelm, in his book On Virginity,* relates that it changed 
its appellation by divine suggestion : his words are as follow. 
As Constantine was sleeping in this city, he imagined that 
there stood before him an old woman, whose for^ead was 
furrowed with age ; but, that presently, dad in an impeiiai 
robe, she became transformed into a beautiful girl, and so 
fascinated his Cjres, by the elegance of her youthful charms, 
that he could not refrain from kissing her : that Helena, his 
mother, being present, then said, *'She shall be yours fbn 

•iona, which, in every country and under every foim of siqMntitioii, act 
Always in the sune way.

ever ; nor shall she die, till the end of tune." The solution 
of this dream, when he awoke, the emperor extorted from 
heaven^ by fasting and ahnsgiving. And behold, within 
eight days, being cast again into a deep sleep, he thought 
he saw pope Silvester, who died some little time before, 
regarding his convert* with complacency, and sajii^, '< You 
have acted with your customary prudence, in waiting for a 
solution, from Grod, of that enigma which was beyond the 
comprehension of man. The old woman you saw, is this 
city, worn down by age, whose time-struck walls, menacing 
approaching ruin, require a restorer. But you, renewing 
its walls, and its affluence, shall signalize it also with your 
name; and here shall the imperial progeny reign for ever. 
Yon shall not, however, lay the foundations at your own 
pleasure ; but mounting the horse on which, when in the 
novitiate of your faith, you rode round the churches of the 
apostles at Rome, you shall give him the rein, and liberty 
to go whither he please : you shall have, too, in your hand, 
your royal spear,')' whose point shall describe the circuit of 
the wall on the ground. You will be regulated, therefore, 
in what manner to dispose the foundations of the wall by 
the track of the spear on the earth." 

The emperor eagerly obeyed the vision, and built a city 
equal to Bome ; alleging that the emperor ought not to reign 
in Rome, where the martyred apostles, from the time of 
Christ, held dominion. He built in it two churches, one 
of which was dedicated to peace ; the other to the apostles ; 
bringing thither numerous bodies of saints, who might con- 
ciliate the assistance of Grod against the incursions of its 
enemies. He placed in the circus, for the admiration and 
ornament of the city, the statues of triumphal heroes, 
brought from Rome, and the tripods from Delphi; and 
the images of heathen deities to excite the contempt of 
the beholders. They relate that it was highly gratifying 
to the mind of the emperor, to receive a mandate from 
heaven, to found a city in that place, where the fruitful- 
ness of the soil, and the temperature of the atmosphere 
conduced to the health of its inhabitants: for as he was

the sun. But Thnicia is a province of £urope, as the poets 
observe, extremelj cool, ^^From Hebrus' ice, and the Bis- 
tonian north ;" and near to Mcesia, where, as Virgil remarks, 
*^ With wonder Gargara the harvest sees."! Constantinople, 
then, washed bj the sea, obtains the mingled temperature 
both of Europe and of Asia ; because, fix)m a short distance, 
the Asiatic east tempers the severitj of the northern blast. 
The city is surrounded bj a vast extent of walls, jet the 
influx of strangers is so great, as to make it crowded. In 
consequence they form a mole in the sea, bj throwing in 
masses of rock, and loads of sand; and the space obtained 
by this new device, straitens the ancient waters. The sea 
wonders to see fields unknown before, amid its glassj waves ; 
and surrounds and supplies its city with all the conveniences 
of the earth. The town is encompassed on every side, ex- 
cept the north, by the ocean, and is Aill of angles in the 
circuit of its walls, where it corresponds with the windings 
of the sea ; which walls contain a space of twenty miles in 
circumference. The Danube,} which is likewise called the 
later, flows in hidden channels under ground, into the city ; 
and on certain days being let out by the removal of a plug, 
it carries off' the filth of the streets into the sea. All yieA 
with the emperor in noble zeal to give splendour to this city, 
each thinking he was bound to advance the work in hand: 
one contributing holy relics, another riches, Constantine all 
things. 

After Constantine the Great, the following emperors reigned 
here. Constantine his son ; Julian the Apostate ; Jovinian, 
Yalens, Theodosius the Great ; Areadius, Theodosius the 
Younger ; Marchianus, Leo the First ; Zeno, Anastasins, 
Justin the Great ; Justinian, who, famed for his literature and 
his wars, built a church in Constantinople to Divine Wisdom ; 
that is, to the Lord Jesus Christ, which he called Hagia 
Sophia; a work, as they report, surpassing every other

Heradius, Heracleonas, Constansy Constantine, the son of 
Heraelius ; who, coming to Rome, and purloining all the 
remains of ancient decoration, stripped the churches even of 
their brazen tiles, anxiously wishing for triumphal honours, 
at Constantinople, even from such spoils as these ; hb 
coretousness, however, turned out unfortunately for him, for 
being shortly after killed at Syracuse, he left all these 
honourable spoils to be conveyed to Alexandria by the Sara- 
cens ; Constantine, Leo the Second ; Justinian, again Justi-

secretly fled to Guiscard in Apulia, and surrendering 
to him his power, imagined he had done something pre- 
judicial to Alexius : hence Guiscard's ambition conceived 
greater designs; falsely persuading himself that he might 
acquire by industry, what the other had lost by inactivity : 
how far he succeeded, the preceding book hath explained.

disdaining to perform this ceremony, from the reoollection 
that he was freely bom and educated. The others, giring 
and receiving promises of fidelity, proceeded in the first week 
of June to Nice, which the rest had already besi^ed £rom 
the middle of May. Uniting, therofore^ their forces^ much 
carnage ensued on either side ; since every kind of weapon 
could easily be hurled by the townsmen on those who were 
beneath them ; and the arm even of the weakest had effect 
' on persons crowded together. Moreover the Turks dragged 
\ up, with iron hooks, numberless dead bodies of our people, 
' to mangle them in mockery ; or to cast them down again 
when stripped of their raiment. The Franks were grieved 
at this : nor did they cease venting their rage by slaughter, 
till the Turks, wearied by extremity of suffering, on the day 
of the summer solstice, surrendered themselves to the empe- 
ror by means of secret messengers. He, who knew only 
how to consult his own advantage, gave orders to the Franks 
to depart : choosing rather, that the city should be reserved 
for the undisguised disloyalty of the Turks, than the dis- 
trusted power of the Fl-anks. He ordered, however, silver 
and gold to be distributed to the chiefs, and copper coin to 
those of inferior rank, lest they should complain of being 
unrewarded. Thus the Turks, who, passing the Euphrates* 
had now for the space of fifty years been possessed of 
Bithjmia, which is a part of Asia Minor that is called Roma- 
nia, betook themselves to flight to the eastward. Neverthe- 
less, when the siege was ended, they attempted, at the insti- 
gation of Soliman,* who had been sovereign of all Romania, 
to harass the army on its advance. This man collecting, as 
is computed, three hundred and sixty thousand archera, 
attacked our people, expecting anything rather than hostility, 
with such violence, that overwhelmed with an iron shower of 
arrows, they were terrified and turned their backs. At that 
time, by chance, duke Godfrey and Hugh the Great, and 
Raimund, had taken another route, that they might plunder 
the enemies' country to a wider extent, and obtain forage 
with more facility. But the Norman, sensible of his extreme

danger, by means of expeditious messengers on a safe track, 
acquainted Crodfrej and the rest of the approach of the 
-^urks. Thej without a moment's delay, turned against the 
enemy, and delivered their associates from danger. For 
these were now indiscriminately slaughtered in l£eir tents, 
unprepared tor resistance, and filling the air with prayers and 
lamentations. Nor did the enemy take any particular aim, 
but trusting his arrows to the wind, he never, from the 
thickness of the ranks, drew his bow in vain. What alone 
retarded destruction was, that the attack took place near a 
thicket of canes, which prevented the Turks from riding full 
speed. At length, however, perceiving the advanced guard 
of the approaching chiefs, the Christians left the thicket, 
and shouting the military watch-word, *' It is the will of 
Grod,'** they attack the scattered ranks of the enemy, making 
a signal to their companions, at the same time to assail them 
in the rear. Thus the Turks, pressed on either side, forth- 
with fled, shrieking with a dreadful cry, and raising a yell 
which reached the clouds. Nor had they recourse to their 
customary practice of a flying battle, but throwing down 
their bows, they manifested, by a flight of three successive 
days, something greater than mere human apprehension. 
Nor was there, indeed, any person to follow them ; for our 
horses, scarce able to support life on the barren turf, were 
unequal to a vigorous pursuit : showing immediately their 
want of strength by their panting sides. Asia was formerly, 
it is true, a land most fruitful in com ; but, both in distant 
and in recent times, it had been so plundered by the savage 
Turks, that it could scarcely suffice for the maintenance of a 
small army, much less of a multitude, so vast as to threaten 
devouring whole harvests and drinking rivers dry. For, 
when they departed from Nice, they were still estimated at 
seven hundred thousand : of the remainder, part had been 
wasted by the sword, part by sickness, and still more had ^ 
deserted to their homes. 

* When Urban II addiesBed the multitude from a loftjr scaffold in the

pope ; and let those words, the inspiration surely of the Holy Spirit, be

Thenoe, then, they arrived at Heradea by the route of 
Antioch and Iconium, cities of Pisidia. Here they beheld in 
the sky a portent fashioned like a flaming sword ; the point 
of which extended towards the east All the period from 
the kalends of July, when they left Nice, till the nones of 
October, had elapsed when th^ arrived at Antioch in Syria.. 
The situation of this city, I should describe^ had not my wish 
in this respect been anticipated by the eloquence of Ajnbro- 
sius in Hegesippus :* were I not also fearful, that I m^ be 
blamed for the perpetual digressions of my narrative. Still, 
however, I will rdate so much as the labour I have under- 
taken seems to require. 

Antioch, which was named after his father, Antiochus, by 
Seleucus, king of Asia, is surrounded with a vast wall, which 
even contains a mountain within it. Next to Rome, and 
Constantinople, and Alexandria, it obtains precedence over 
the cities of the world It is secure by its walls, lofty from 
its situation ; and if ever taken, must be gained more by in- 
genuity than force. The nearest river to it, which I learn 
is now called Fervus, though originally Qrontes, falls into 
the sea twelve miles from the city ; its tide impetuous, and 
growing colder from its violence, ministers to the health of 
the inhabitants by its effect on the atmosphere. Capable too 
of receiving supplies by shipping for the service of its citi- 
zens, it can at all times mock the perseverance of its besiegers. 
Here the venerable title of Christian was first conceived: 
hence, first St. Paul, the spring and spur of this religion, 
went forth to preach ; here the first pontific seat was filled 
by St. Peter ; in honour to whom the church there founded 
remained uninjured through the whole domination of the 
Turks : and equally also did another, consecrated in honour 
of St Mary, strike the eyes of beholders with its beauty, ex- 
citing wonder that they should reverence the church of him 
whose faith they persecuted. 

This city, then, the Franks invested from October till 
June ;f pitching their tents around the walls after they had

passed the river. Foreseeing, however, the difficulty of tak- 
ing it, and judging it expedient to provide against the cow- 
ardice of certain of their party, the chiefs, in common, took 
an oath, that they would not desist from the si^e till the 
city should be taken by force or by stratagem. And, that 
they might more easily complete their design, they built many 
fortresses on this side of the river, in which soldiers were 
placed to keep guard. Aoxianns, too, the governor of the 
city, observing that the Franks acted neither jestingly nor 
coldly, but set heartily to besiege it, sent his son Sansadol to 
the Sultan, emperor of Persia, to make known the boldness 
of the Franks, and to implore assistance. Sultan among the 
Persians implies the same as Augustus among the Romans : 
Commander of all the Saracens, and of the whole east. I 
imagine this empire has continued so long, and still increases, 
because the people, as I have related, are unwarlike; and 
being deficient in active blood, know not how to cast off 
slavery, when once admitted ; not being aware, as Luoan 
says,* that 

'' Arms were bestowed that men should not be slayeB." 

But the western nations, bold and fierce, disdain long-con- 
tinued sulgugation to any people whatever ; oflen delivering 
themselves from servitude, and imposing it on others. More- 
over, the Roman empire first declined to the Franks, and 
afl;er to the Germans : the eastern continues ever with the 
Persians. 

Sansadol therefore being despatched to the chief of this 
empire, hastened his course with youthful ardour, while his 
father was by no means wanting to the duties of a com- 
mander, in the protection of the city. The valour of the 
besieged was not content merely to defend their own party, 
but voluntarily harassed ours ; frequently and suddenly 
attacking them when foraging or marketing : for, making a 
bridge of the vessels they found there, they had established 
a mart beyond the river. Through Christ's assistance, there- 
fore, becoming resolute, they seized their arms, and boldly 
repelled their enemies, so that they never suffered them to 
reap the honour of the day. To revenge this disgrace, the 
Turks wreaked their indignation on the Syrian and Arme-

shdn into the camp of the Franks, that bj such means thej 
might wound their feelings. 

And now, ever3rthing which could be procured for food 
being destroyed around the city, a sudden famine, which 
usudQy makes even fortresses give way, began to oppress 
the army ; so much so^ that the harvest not having yet at- 
tained to maturity, some persons seized the pods of beans 
before they were ripe, as the greatest delicacy : others fed 
on carrion, or hides soaked in water ; others passed parboiledf 
thistles through their bleeding jaws into their stomachs. 
Others sold mice, or such like dainties, to those who required 
them ; content to suffer hunger themselves, so that they 
could procure money. Some, too, there were, who even fed 
their corpse-like bodies with other corpses, eating human 
flesh ; but at a distance, and on the mountains, lest others 
should be offended at the smell of their cookery. Many 
wandered through unknown paths, in expectation of meeting 
with sustenance, and were killed by robbers acquainted with 
the passes. But not long after the city was surrendered. 

For Boamund, a man of superior talents, had, by dint of 
very great promises, induced a Turkish chief,:^ who had the 
custody of the principal tower, on the side where his station 
lay, to deliver it up to him. And he, too, to palliate the 
infamy of his treachery by a competent excuse, gave his son 
as an hostage to Boamund ; professing that he did so by the 
express command of Christ, which had been communicated 
to liim in a dream. Boamund, therefore, advanced his troops 
to the tower, having first, by a secret contrivance, obtained 
from the chiefs the perpetual government of the city, in case 
he could carry it. Thus the Franks, in the dead of the 
night, scaling the walls by rope ladders, and displaying on 
the top of the tower the crimson standard of Boamund, re- 
peated with joyful accents the Christian watchword, '^ It is 
the will of God I It is the will of God P The Turks

awaking, and heavy from want of rest, took to flight through 
narrow passages ; and our party, following with drawn 
swords, made dreadful slaughter of the enemy. In this flight 
fell Aoxianus, governor of the city, heing heheaded by a cer- 
tain Syrian peasant : his head, when brought to the Flanks, 
excited both their laughter and their joy. 

Not long rejoicing in this complete victory, they had the 
next day to lament being themselves besieged by the Turks 
from without. For the forces which had been solicited by 
Sansadol were now arrived under the command of Cor- 
baguath, an eastern satrap, who had obtained from the em- 
peror of Persia threeTiuiidred thousand men.* under twenty* 
seven commanders. Sixty thousand of these ascended over 
the rocks to the citadel, by desire of the Turks, who still 
remained in possession of it. These woefully harassed the 
Christians by frequent sallies : nor was there any hope left, 
but from the assistance of God, since want was now added 
to the miseries of war — ^want, the earliest attendant on great 
calamities. Wherefore, after a fast of three days, and ear- 
nest supplications, Peter the hennjLt Wfis sent ambassador to 
the Turks, who spake with his usual eloquence to the follow- 
ing effect : " That the Turks should now voluntarily evacu- 
ate the Christian territory, which they had formerly unjustly 
invaded ; that it was but right, as the Christians did not 
attack Persia, that the Turks should not molest Asia ; that 
they should therefore, either by a voluntary departure, seek 
their own country, or expect an attack on the following 
morning ; that they might try their fortune, by two, or four, 
or eight, that danger might not accrue to the whole army." 

Corbaguath condescended not to honour the messenger 
even with a reply; but playing at chess and gnashing his 
teeth, dismissed him as he came ; merely observing, " that 
the pride of the Franks was at an end." Hastily returning,

Peter apprised the armj of the insolence of the Turk. Each 
then animating the other, it was publidj ordered, that every 
person should, that night, feed his horse as plentifully as 
possible, lest he should falter from the various evolutions of 
the following day. And now the morning dawned, when, 
drawn up in bodies, they proceeded, with hostile standard, 
/ ogainst the enemy. The first band was led by the two 
( Roberts, of Normandy and Flanders, and Hugh the Great; 
the second by Godfrey ; the third by the bishop of Puy ; the 
reserve by Boamund, as a support to the rest. Rumund 
' continued in the city, to cover the retreat of our party, in 
case it should be necessary. The Turks, from a distance, 
observing their movements, were, at first, dubious what they 
could mean. Afterwards, recognizing the standard of the 
bishop, for they were extremely afraid of him, as they said 
he was the pope of the Christians and the fomenter of the 
war ; and seeing our people advancing so courageously and 
quickly, they fled ere they were attacked. Our party, too, 
exhilarated with unexpected joy, slew them as they were 
flying, as far as the strength of Uie infantry, or exertion of 
the cavalry, would permit. They imagined, moreover, that 
they saw the ancient martyrs, who had formerly been 
soldiers, and who had gained eternal remuneration by their 
death, I allude to Goorge and Demetrius, hastily approaching 
with upraised banner from the mountainous districts, hurling 
darts against the enemy, but assisting the Franks. Nor is it 
to be denied, that the martyrs did assist the Christians, as 
the angels formerly did the Maccabees, fighting for the self- 
same cause. Returning, then, to the spoil, they found in 
their camp suflicient to satisfy, or even totally to glut, the 
covetousness of the greediest army. This battle took place 
A. D. 1098, on the fourth before the kalends of July ; for the 
city had been taken the day before the nones of June. Sooq 
after, on the kalends of the ensuing August, the bishop of 
Puy, the leader of the Christians, and chief author of this 
laudable enterprise, joyfully yielded to the common lot of 
mortals ; and Hugh the Grea^ by permission of the chiefs, 
as it is said, returned to France^ fdleging as a reason, the per- 
petual racking of his bowels. 

But when, by a long repose of seven months at Antioch, 
they had obliterated the memory of their past labours, they

began to think of proceeding on their route. And first of all 
Raimund, ever unconscious of sloth, ever foremost in mili'- 
tarj energy ; and next to him the two Roberts, and Grodfrej, 
proceeded upon the march. Boamund alone, for a time, 
deferred his advance, lured bj the prospect of a magnificent 
city and the love of wealth. A plausible reason, however, 
lay concealed beneath his covetousness, when he alleged, that 
AjQtioch ought not to be exposed to the Turks without a 
chief, as they would directly attack it. He therefore took 
up his residence in the city ; and this harsh governor drove 
RjEumund's followers, who occupied one of the streets, with- 
out the walls. 

The others, however, passing through Tripoli,* and Berith, 
and Tyre, and Sidon, and Accaron, and Caiphas, and Cse- 
sarea of Palestine, where they left the coast to the right 
band, came to Ramula; being kindly received by some of 
the cities, and signalizing their valour by the subjugation of 
others. For their design was to delay no longer, as it was 
now the month of April, and the produce of the earth had 
become fully ripe. Ramula is a very small city, without 
walls : if we credit report, the place of the martyrdom of St. 
George ; whose church, originally founded there, the Turks 
had somewhat defaced : but at that time, through fear of the 
Franks, they had carried off their property and retreated to 
the mountains. The next morning, at early dawn, Tancred, 
the nephew of Boamund, a man of undaunted courage, and 
some others, taking arms, proceeded to Bethlehem, desirous 
of exploring its vicinity. The Syrians of the place, who 
came out to meet them, manifested their joy with weeping 
earnestness, through apprehension for their safety, on account 
of the smallness of their numbers ; for few more than a hun- 
dred horsemen were of the party. But our people having 
suppliantly adored the sacred edifice, f imme&ately stretch 
anxiously forward towards Jerusalem. The Turks, confi- 
dent of their force, fiercely sallied out, and for some time 
skirmished with our troops, for the whole army had now

come up; but they were soon repulsed bj the exertions of 
the Franks, and sought security from their encircling walls. 
The numbers who have already written on the subject, 
admonish me to say nothing of the situation and disposition 
of Jerusalem, nor is it necessary for my narratiye to expa- 
tiate on such a field. Almost every person is acquainted 
with what Josephus, Eucherius, and Bede, have said: for 
who is not aware, that it was called Salem from Melchisedec ; 
Jebus from the Jebusites ; Jerusalem from Solomon ? Who 
has not heard how often, falling firom adverse war, it buried 
its inhabitants in its ruins, through the different attacks <^ 
Nabugodonosor, of Titus, or of Adrian? It was this last 
who rebuilt Jerusalem, odled ^ilia, after his surname, en- 
closing it with a circular wall, of greater compass, that it 
might embrace the site of the sepulchre of our Lord, which 
originally stood without : Mount Sion, too, added to the dty, 
stands eminent as a citadeL It possesses no springs;* but 
water, collected in cisterns, prepared for that purpose, sup- 
plies the wants of the inhabitants : for the site of the city, 
beginning from the northern summit of Mount Sion, has so 
gentle a declivity, that the rain which falls there does not 
form any mire, but running like rivulets, is received into 
tanks, or flowing through the streets, augments the brook 
Kedron. Here is the church of our Lord, and the temple, 
which they call Solomon's, by whom built is unknown, but 
religiously reverenced by the Turks; more especially the 
church of our Lord, where th^ daily worshipped, and pro- 
hibited the Christians from entering, having placed there a 
statue of Mahomet. Here also is a church of elegant work- 
manship, containing the holy sepulchre, built by Gonstantine 
the Great, and which has never suffered any injury from the 
enemies of our faith, through fear, as I suppose, of being 
struck by that celestial fire which brightly shines in lamps, 
every year, on the Vigil f of Easter. When this miracle had

a begiiming, or whether it existed hefore the limes of the 
Ssracens, Idstoiy has left no trace. I have read in the 
writings of Bernard* the monk, that ahout two hundred and 
fifty years ago, that is, a. d. 870, he went to Jerusalem and 
saw that fire, and was entertained in the Hospital which the 
most glorious Charles the Great had there ordered to be 
built^ and where he had collected a library at great expense. 
fie relates, that both in Egypt and in that place, the Chris- 
tians, under the dominion of the Turks, enjoyed such secu- 
rity, that if any traveller lost a beast of burden by accident, 
in the midst <^ the high road, he might leave his baggage 
and proceed to the nearest city for assistance, and without 
doubt find every thing untouched at his return. Still, from 
the 8iispici<m that they might be spies, no foreign Christian 
ooold live there securely, unless protected by the signet of 
the emperor of Babylon. The natives purchiued peace from 
the Turks at the expense of three talents or bezants an- 
nually. But as Bernard mentions the name of Theodosius, 
thei then patriarch, this gives me an occasion of enumerating 
the whole of the patriarchs. 

James the brother of our Lord and son of Joseph ; Simon 
son of Cleophas, the cousin of Christy for Cleophas was the 
brother of Joseph; Justus, Zaccheus, Tobias, Benjamin, 
Johannes, Maccabeeus, Philip, Seneca, Justus, Levi, Effrem, 
Jesse, Judas ; these fifteen were circumcised : Mark, Cas- 
sian, Publius, Maximus, Julian, Grains ; who first celebrated 
Easter and Lent after the Roman manner : Symmachus, 
Gains, Julian, Capito, Maximus, Antonius, Yalens, Docilia- 
nus, Narcissus, Dius, Germanic, Grordius, Alexander, Maza- 
banus, Lrmeneus, Zabdas, Ermon, Macharius; in his time 
the Holy Cross was found by St. Helena : Cyriacus, Max- 
imus, CyriUus, who built the church of the Holy Sepulchre, 
and of Mount Calvary, and of Bethlehem, and of the Valley 
of Jehosaphat All these were called bishops. After them

several interesting particulars. There is also a good MS. in the British 
Museum, Bib. Cott. Faust b. 1, where, hj a mistake of the scribe, it is 
dated a. d. 970, but this is clearly wrong, for Bernard mentions L^visy king 
of Italy, as then living, and he died a« d. 876.

rious from Persia : Sophronius, in whose tune the Saracens 
came and thrust out all the Christians from Jerusalem^ except 
the patriarch, whom they suffered to remain out of reyerence 
to his sanctity : this was the period when the Saracens oyer- 
ran the whole of Egypt, and Africa, and Judea, and eren Spain, 
and the Balearic Isles. Part of Spain was wrested firom them 
by Charles the Great, but the remainder, together with the 
countries I have enumerated, they have possessed for nearly 
five hundred years, down to the present day: Theodorus,^ 
Bia, €reorgius, Thomas, Basilius, Sergius, Salomontes, 
Theodosius, whom Bernard relates to have been an abba^

si^e to Jerusalem, and rescued it from the luinds of the 
Turks and of the king of Babylon. 

In the fourth jear, then, of the expedition to Jerusalem, 
the third after the capture of Nice, and the second after 
that of Antioch, the Franks laid siege to Jerusalem, — ^a city 
well able to repay the toils of war, to soothe its labours, and 
to requite the fondest expectation. It was now the seyenth 
day of June, nor were ^e besiegers apprehensive of want- 
ing food or drink for themselves, as the harvest was on the 
ground, and the grapes were ripe upon the vines ; the care 
alone of their cattle distressed them, which, from the nature 
of the place and of the season, had no running stream to 
support tiiem, for the heat of the sun had dned up the 
secret springs of the brook Siloah, which, at uncertain 
periods, used to shed abroad its refreshing waters. This 
brook, when at any time swollen with rain, increases that of 
Kedron ; and then passes on, with bubbling current, into the 
valley of Jehosaphat. But this is extremely rare ; for there 
is no certain period of its augmentation or decrease. In 
consequence, the enemy, suddenly darting from their caverns, 
^?eqU^Qtly killed our people, when straggling abroad for the 
puipcSSV^ watering the cattle. In the meantime the chiefs 
were each observant at thdr respective posts, and Raymond 
actively employed before the tower of David.* This fortress, 
defending the city on the west^ and strengthened, nearly half 
way up, by courses of squared stone soldered with lead, 
repels every fear of invaders when guarded by a small party 
within. As they saw, therefore^ that the city was difficult 
to carry on account of tiie steep precipices, the strength of 
the walls, and the fierceness of the enemy, they ordered 'j^ 
engines to be constructed. But before this, indeed, on tiie 
seventh day of the siege, they had tried their fortune by 
erecting ladders, and hurHng swift arrows against their oppo- 
nents: but, as the ladders were few, and perilous to those 
who mounted them, since they were exposed on all sides and 
nowhere protected from wounds, they changed their design. 
There was one engine which we call the Sow, the ancients, . 
Yinea; because the machine^ which is constructed of\

filiglit timbers, the roof covered with boardJB and wicker- 
work, and the sides defended with undressed hides^ protects 
those who are within it, who, after the manner of a sow, 
proceed to undermine the foundations of the walls. There 
was another, which, for want of timber, was but a moderate 
sized tower, oonstmcted after the manner of houses :* they 
call it Bere&eid: this was intended to equal the walls in 
height. The making of this machine delayed the siege^ <m 
account of the unskilfulness of the workmen and the scarci^ 
of the wood. And now the fourteenth day of July arriyed, 
when some began to undermine the waU with the sows, 
others to moye forward the tower. To do this more con- 
yeniently, they took it towards the works in separate pieces, 
and, putting it together again at such a distance as to be out 
of bowshot, adyanced it on wheels nearly dose to the 
wall. In the meantime, the slingers with stones, the archers 
with arrows, and the cross-bow-men with bolts, each intent 
on his own department, began to press forwsrd and dislodge 
their opponents from the ramparts ; soldiers, too, unmatched 
in courage, ascend the tower, waging nearly equal war 
against the enemy with missile weapons and widi stones. 
Nor, indeed, were our foes at all remiss ; but trusting their 
whole security to their valour, they poured down grease and 
burning oil upon the tower, and slung stones on the soldiers, 
rejoicing in the completion of their desires by the destruc- 
tion of multitudes. During the whole of that day the battle 
was such that neither party seemed to think they had been 
worsted ; on the following, which "was the fifteenth of July, 
the business was decided. For the Franks, becoming more 
experienced from the event of the attack of the preceding 
day, threw £iiggots flaming with oil on a tower adjoining 
the wall, and on the party who defended it, which, blaiiDg 
by the action of the wind, first seized the timber and then 
the stones, and drove off ihe garrison. Moreover the beams 
which the Turks had left hanging down horn the walls in 
order that, being forcibly drawn back, they might, by their 
recoil, batter the tower in pieces in case it should advance 
too near, were by the Franks dragged to them, by cutdn 
away the ropes ; and being placed from the engine to th]

wall, and covered with nurdles, thej fonned a bridge of com* - t. 

munication from the ramparts to the tower. Thus what the 
infidels had contriyed for their defence became the means of 
their destruction; for then the enemj, dismayed by the 
smoking masses of flame and by the courage of our soldiers^ 
began to give way. These adyancing on the wiD, and 
thence into the dty, manifested the excess of their joy by 
the strenuonsness of their exertions. This success took 
place on the side of Godfrey and of the two Roberts ; Ray- 
mond knew nothing of the circumstance, till the' cry of the 
fugitives and the alarm of the people, throwing thcmsdyes ^ ^ « . 
from the walls, who thus met death while flying from it^ 
acquainted him that the city was taken. On seeing this^ he . • '^ ^ 
rushed with drawn sword on the runaways, and haistened to "^ ^ 

avenge the injuries of Grod, until he had satiated his own v ^ 
animosi^. Moreover, adv^iing to the advantages of quiet v. N 
for the moment, he sent unhurt to Ascalon five hundred \ 
Ethiopians, who^ retreating to the citadel of David, had v ' 
given up the keys of the gates under promise of per- < 
sonal safety. There was no place of refuge for the Turks^ ^^ ' ' 
so indiscriminately did the insatiable rage of the victors ^ ^ 

sweep away both the suppliant and the resisting. Ten thou- ' ' \ - 
sand were slain in the temple of 'Solomon; more were '^^ 

thrown from the tops of the churches, and of the citadel ^ • 
After this, the dead bodies were heaped and dissolved into a 
the aery fluid by means of fire ; lest putrifying in the open V 
air, they should pour contagion on the heavy atmosphere. .j> 
The city being thus expiated by the slaughter of the infidels, — >. / 
they proceeded with hearts contrite and bodies prostrate to \ \ 
the sepulchre of the Lord, which they had so long earnestly j 

nought after, and for which they had undergone so many 
labours. By what ample incense of prayer, they propitiated ^ 

heaven, or by what repentant tears they once again brought 
hack the favour of God, none, I am confident^ can describe; 
no, not if the splendid eloquence of the ancients could revive 
or Orpheus himself return ; who, as it is said, bent e*en the 
h:«tening rocks to his harmonious strain. Be it imagined 
then, rather than expressed. 

So remarkable was the example of forbearance exhibited 
hy the chiefs, that, neither on that, nor on the following day, 
did any of them, through lust of spoil, withdraw his mind

from foHowiDg up the Tictory. Timcred alone, beset with 
ill-timed covetousness, carried off some Taluable effects from 
the temple of Sdomon ; but, hflemrards, reprored by his 
own consciences, and the address of some other persons, he 
restored, if not the same things, yet such as were of equal 
value.* At that time, if any man, however poor, sdzed a 
house, or riches of any kind, he did not afterwards encounter 
the brawlings of the powerful, but held, what he had once 
possessed, as his hereditary right. Without delay, then, 
Godfrey, that brilliant mirror of Christian nobility, in 
which, as in a splendid cdlingyf the lustre ~6r every virtue 
was reflected, was chosen king ; ) all, in lively hope, agree-

But the emperor of Babylon, not the city built by Nimrod 
and enlarged by Semiramis and now said to be deserted, but 
that which Cambyses, son of Cyrus, built in Egypt, on the 
spot where Taphms formerly stood : the emperor of Babylon, 
I say, venting his long-conceived indignation against the 
Franks, sent the conmiander of his forces, to drive them, as 
he said, out of his kingdom. Hastening to fulfil the command, 
when he heard that Jerusalem was taken, he redoubled his 
diligence, though he liad by no means been indolent before. 
Tlie design of the barbarian was to besiege the Christians in 
Jerusalem, and after the victory, which he, falsely presaging, 
already obtained in imagination, to destroy utterly the sepul- 
chre of our Lord. The Christians, who desired nothing less 
than again to endure the miseries of a siege, taking courage 
tlurough God's as^stance, march out of the city towards 
Ascalon, to oppose the enemy ; and carry with them part of 
the cross of Christ, which a certain Syrian, an inhabitant of

fortunate and a lojal device, that the secret should be all

avenge the injuries of heaven. In the morning, tiierefore^ 
as the army was on its march, you might see^ I believe by 
divine instinct, the cattle with their heads erect^ proceeding 
by the side of die soldiers, and not to be driven away by any 
force. The enemy perceiving this at a distance, and thsar 
sight being dazzled by the rays of the sun, lost thdr 
confidence, ere the battle could commence^ as they thought 
the multitude of their opponents was countless : yet were 
they, themselves, by no means deficient in numbers, and by 
long exercise, trained to battle. They endeavoured therefore 
to hem in ihe Franks, who were proceeding at a slow rate^ 
by dividing their force into two bodies, and by curving thdr 
wings. But the leaders, and more especially Bob^ the 
Norman, who was in the advanced guard, eludmg stratagem 
by stratagem, or rather cunning by valour, 1^ on Ihdr 
archers and infantry, and broke through the centre of the 
heathens. Moreover the Lorraine cavalry, which was 
stationed with its commander in the rear, advancing by 
the fianks, prevented their flight, and occupied the whole 
plain. Thus the Turks, penetrated in the front, and hemmed 
in on every side, were slain at the pleasure of the victors ; 
the remainder escaping through favour of approaching night. 
Many golden utensils wero found in their camp ; many 
jewels, which, though from their scarcity unknown in our 
country, there shine in native splendour. Nor was there 
ever a moro joyful victory for the Christians^ because they 
obtained the most procious spoil without loss. 

Returning therefore to Jerusalem, when, by a rest of 
niany days, they had recruited their strength, some of them, 
sighing for their native country, prepared to return by sea. 
Godfrey and Tancred only remained ; princes, truly noble, 
and, to whose glory, posterity, if it judge rightly, never can

set limits: men, who^ from the intense cold of Europe, 
plunged into the insupportable heat of the East : prodigal 
of their own lives, so that they could succour suffering 
Christianitj. Who^ besides Hhe fears of barbarous incursions, 
in constant apprehension from the unwholesomeness of an 
unknown climate, despised the security of rest and of health 
in their own country ; and although rery few in numb^, 
kept in subjection so many hostile cities by their reputation 
and prowess. They were memorable patterns, too^ of trust 
in God ; not hesitating to remain in that dimate^ where they 
might either suffer fiom pestilential air, or be slain by the 
rage of the Saracens. Let the celebration of the poets then 
give way ; nor let ancient fiction extol her earliest heroes. 
No age hath produced aught comparable to the fame of these 
men. For, if the ancients had any merit, it vanished after 
death with the smoke of their funeral pile ; because it had 
been spent^ rather on the vapour of earthfy reputation, than 
in the acquisition of substantial good. But the utility of 
these men's valour will be felt, and its dignity acknowledged, 
as long as the world shall continue to revolve^ or pure 
Christianity to flourish. What shall I say of the good order 
and forbearance of the whole army ? There was no gluttony ; 
no lewdness, which was not directly corrected by the 
authority of the commanders, or the preaching of the bishops. 
There was no wish to plunder as they passed through ihe 
territories of the Christians ; no controversy among them- 
selves, which was not easily settled by the examination of 
mediators. Wherefore, since the commendation of an army 
so well-ordered redounds to the glory of its conductors, I 
will signalize, in my narrative, the exploits and the adven- 
tures of each respective chief ; nor will I subtract any thing 
from the truth, as I received it on the faith of my relators. 
But let no one who has had a fuller knowledge of these 
events, accuse me of want of diligence^ since we, who are 
secluded on this side of the British ocean, hear but the faint 
echo of Asiatic transactions. 

King Godfrey takes the lead in my conmiendation : he 
was the son of Eustace count of Boulogne, of whom I have 
spoken in the time of king Edward, but more ennobled matern- 
ally, as by that line he was descended from Charles the 
Great For, his mother, named Ida, daughter of the ancient 



AA 10M.J QODFBET OF BOUIIXOIT. 89S 

Godfrey duke of Lorraine, had a brother called (Godfrey after 
his father, sumamed Bocard. This was at the time when 
Robert Friso, of whom I have spoken abore^ on the death of 
Florence, dake of Fiiesland, married his widow Grertade ; 
advancing Theodoric, his son-in-law, to the sacoessioQ of the 
duchj. Bocard could not endure this ; but expelling Friso^ 
subjected the country to his own wilL Friso^ unable to re- 
venge himself by war, did it by stratagem ; killing Bocard i 
through the agency of his Flemings^ who drove a weapoa ' 
into his posteriors, as he was sitting for a natural occasion* j 
In this manneiMQie son-in-law succeeded to the duchy, bj j 
the means of his father-in-law. The wife of this Godfrey [ 
was the marchioness Matilda, mentioned in the former bool^ 
who on her husband's death spiritedly retained the duchy, in 
opposition to the emperor ; more -especially in Italy, for of 
Lorraine and the hither-countries he got possession. Ida 
then, as I began to relate, animated her son Godfrey with 
great expectations of getting the earldom of Lorraine : for the 
paternal inheritance had devolved on Eustace her eldest son ; 
the youngest, Baldwin, was yet a boy. Grodfrey arriving at 
a sufficient age to bear arms, dedicated his services to the 
emperor Henry, who is mentioned in the preceding book. 
Acquiring his friendship, therefore, by unremitdng exertions^ 
he received from the empecor^s singular liberality the whole 
of Lorraine as a recompence. Hence it arose, that when the 
quarrel broke out between the pope and Henry, he went with 
the latter to the siege of Rome ; was the first to break 
through that part of the wall which was assigned for his 
attack, and facilitated the entrance of the besiegers. Being 
in extreme perspiration, and panting with heat, lie entered a 
subterraneous vault which he found in his way, and when he 
had there appeased the violence of his thirst by an excessive 
draught of wine, he brought on a quartan fever. Others say 
that he fell a victim to poisoned wine^ as the Romans, and 
men of that country, are used to infect whole casks. Others 
report, that a portion of the walls fell to his lot, where^ the 
Tiber flowing, exhales destructive vapours in the morning ( 
that by this fatal pest, all his soldiers, with the exception of 
JoD, lost their lives ; aiid that himself, losing his nails and 
%\5 hair, never entirely recovered. But be it which it might 
of these, it appears that he was never free from a slow fev«%

until bearing the report of the expedition to Jerasalem, he 
made a vow to go thither^ if God would kindly restore his 
health. The moment this vow was made, the strength of the 
duke revived ; so that, recovering apace, he shook disease 
from his limhs, and rising with expanded breast^ as it were, 
from years of decrepitude, shone with renovated youth. In 
consequence, grateful for the mercies of God showered down 
upon him, he went to Jerusalem the very first, or among the 
first ; leading a numerous army to the war. And though he 
commanded a hardy and experienced band, yet none was 
esteemed readier to attack, or more efficient in the combat 
than himsel£ Indeed it is known, that, at the siege of An* 
tioch, with a Lorrainian sword, he cut asunder a Turk, who 
bad demanded single combat, and that one half of the man 
lay panting on the ground, while the horse, at full speed, 
carried away the other: so firmlv the miscreant sat 
Another also who attacked him he clave asunder from the 
neck to the groin, by taking aim at his head with a sword ; 
nor did the dreadful stroke stop here, but cut entirely through 
the saddle, and the back-bone of the horse. I have heard a 
man of veracity rekte, that he had seen what I here subjoin : 
during the siege, a soldier of the duke's had gone out to 
forage ; and being attacked by a lion, avoided destruction for 
<;:' some time, by the interposition of his shield. Grodfrey, 

^^ grieved at this sight, transfixed the ferocious animal with a 

bunting spear. Wounded, and becoming fiercer firom the 
pain, it turned against the prince with such violence as to 
hurt liis log with the iron which projected firom the wound ; 
and had he not hastened with his sword to rip it up, thi^ 
pattern of valour must have perished by the tusk of a wild 
beast. Benowned from these successes, he was exalted to be 
king of Jerusalem, more espedally because he was con- 
spicuous in rank and courage without being arrogant. Hi^ 
dominion was small and confined, containing, besides the fe^ 
surrounding towns, scarcely any cities. For the king's had 
state of health, which attacked him immediately after tho 
Babylonish war, caused a cessation of warlike enterprise ; ^ 
that he made no acquisitions : yet, by able management, h^* 
so well restrained the avidity of the barbarians for the whole 
of that year, that nothing was lost. They report that the 
king, from being unused to a state of indolence, fell again

into his original fever ; but I conjectare^ that God, in his 
own good time, chose early to translate, to a better Idngdom, 
a soul rendered acceptable to him and tried by so manr 
labours, lest wickedness should change his hearty or deceit 
beguile his understanding. Revolying tame thus completing 
n reign of one year, he died placidly, and was buried on 
Mount Grolgotha ;* a king as unconquerable in death, as he 
had formerly been in battle ; often kindly repressing the tears 
of the by-standers. Being asked who was to succeed him, 
he mentioned no person by name, but said merely, ^whoever 
was most worthy." He never would wear the ensign of 
royalty, saying, *4t was too great arrogance for him to be 
crowned for glory, in that city, in wUch God had been 
crowned in mockery." He died on the fifteenth before the 
kalends of August. 

On Grodfre/s decease, Tancred and the other chiefs de- 
dared that Baldwin, his brother, who was at that time settled 
in Mesopotamia, should be king : for Eustace^ the elder 
brother, who came to Jerusalem with Grodfrey, had long since 
returned to his native land. The acts of Baldwin shall be 
related briefly, but with unsullied truth ; supported in their 
credibility by the narrative of Fulcher| of Chartres, who 
was his chaplain, and wrote somewhat of him, in a style, not 
altogether unpolished, but^ as we say, without elegance or 
correctness, and which may serve to admonish others to write 
more carefully. Baldwin, undertaking the holy pilgrimage 
^yith the rest, had for companions many knights of dispo- 
sition similar to his own. Confiding in these associates, he 
began to levy fresh troops for his purpose ; to watch for 
brilliant opportunities wherein to manifest his prowess : and, 
fmallj, not content with that commendation which was com- 
mon to all, leaving the rest and departing three days* journey 
from Antioch, he got possession, by the consent of its in- 
habitants, of Tarsus, a noble city of Cilicia : Tarsus, for- 
merly the nursing-mother of the apostle Paul, in honour of 
^hom the cathedral there is dedicated. The Tarsians volun-

torilj submitted to his protection, as thej were Christiana, 
and hoped bj his aid to be defended from the Turks. The 
Cilicions, therefore, eagerlj yielded to his power, more espe- 
ciall J after the surrender of Turbexhel, a town by situation 
impregnable, to whose sovereignty the infisrior towns look 
up. This being yielded, as I have said, tlie others followed 
its decision. And not only Cifida, but Armenia, and Meso- 
potamia, eagerly sought alliance with this chief : for these 
provinces were almost free from the domination of the Turks, 
though infested by their incursions. Wherefore the prince 
of the city of Edessa, who was alike pressed by the hatred 
of the citizens and the sword of the enemy, sent letters to 
Baldwin, descriptive of his difficulties, desiring him to come 
with all speed, and receive a compensation for the labour of 
his journey, by his adoption, as he had no issue of either sex. 
This is a city of Mesopotamia in Syria, very noted for the 
fruitfulness of its soil and for the resort of merchants, twenty 
miles distant from the Euphrates, and a hundred from 
Antioch. The Greeks call it Edessa ; the Syrians Bothasia. 
Baldwin, therefore, exacting an oath of fidelity from the 
ambassadors, passed the Euphrates with only sixty-nine 
horsemen : a wonderful instance, it may be said, either of 
fortitude, or of rashness, in not hesitating to proceed among 
'^ the surrounding nations of barbarians, whom any other per- 

son, with so small a force, would have distrusted either for 
their race or their unbelief. By the Armenians and Syrians, 
indeed, coming out to meet him on the road with crosses and 
torches, he was received with grateful joy, and kindly enter- 
tained. But the Turks, endeavouring to attack his rear, were 
frustrated in all their attempts by the skill of Baldwin : 
the Samosatians setting the first example of flight. Samo- 
sata is a city beyond the Euphrates, from which arose Paul 
of Samosata,* the confutation of whose heresy, whoever 
b desirous may read in the History of Eusebius. And, if I 
well remember, Josephus says, that Antony was layihg siege 

* Paul was bishop of Antioch in the third centujj. ^ He was better 
pleased with the title of duecnarius than with that of bishon. Ilia ben^y, 
bke those of Noctus and Labellius in the same century, tenaed to confound 
tho mysterious distinction of the Divine persons. He was degraded fronj 
b» see in 270, by tho sentence of eighty bishops, and altogether deprived 
of his office in 274 by Aurclian (Mosheim*s Ecc Hist. toI. i. p. 702, &cr

to this city, when Herod came to him. The Turkfl inhabit- 
ing that city then, who were the first instigators of outrage 
against the Franks, were the first to give way. Thus, 
Baldwin, coming safely to Edessa, found nothing to disap- 
point his expectations : for being recdred with surpassing 
favour by the prince, and soon aflter, on his being killed by 
his faithless citizens, obtaining the lawful sovereignty of the 
dty, for the whole time during which the Franks were 
labouring at Antioch and at Jerusalem, he was not free from 
hostilities ; worsting his opponents in repeated attacks. 

But in the month of November, being reminded by Boa- 
mund, prince of Antioch, that liiey should enter on their 
progress to Jerusalem, he prepared for marching, and by 
the single display of the white standard, which was his 
ensign in batUe, overthrowing the Turks who had broken 
the peace on his expected departure, he left Antioch to the 
right; and came to Laodicea. Here, by the lifoeralily of 
earl Raymond, who presided over the city, getting, at a 
cheap rate, a sufficiency of supplies for his people, he 
passed Gibdlum^ and followed the recent track of Boa- 
mund, who had encamped and awaited him. Daibert, arch- 
bishop of Fisa, joined them for the march: he had landed 
his confederate party at Laodicea, as did also two other 
bishops. These forces when united were estimated at five 
and twenty thousand; many of whom, when they entered 
the territories of the Saracens, were, through the scarcity 
of commodities, overtaken by famine, and many were dis- 
mounted, from their horses being starved. Their ^distress 
was increased by an abundance of rain ; for in that country 
it pours down like a torrent in the winter months only. Jn 
consequence, these poor wretches, having no change of gar- 
ments, died from the severity of the cold; never getting 
under cover during several successive days. For this ca- 
lamity, indeed, there was no remedy, as there was a de- 
ficiency both of tents and of wood: but they in some 
measure appeased their hunger, by constantly chewing the 
sweet reeds, which they call cannamel;* so denominated 
from cane and honey. Thus, twice only, obtaining neces-

saries at an exorbitant price from the inhabitants of Tripoli 
and Caesareay they came to Jerusalem on the day of the 
winter sobtice. Thej were met at the gates by long God- 
frey with his brother Eustace, whom he had detained till 
this time, who showed them every degree of respect and 
generosity. Having performed in Bethlehem all the accus- 
tomed solemnities of our Lord's nativity, they appointed 
Daibert patriarch: to which transaction I doubt not^ that 
the consent of pope Urban was obtained; for he was re- 
verend from age, doqueut, and rich. After the drcumcision 
of our Lordy tiierefore, jf>afliitning palms* in Jericho^ which 
antiquity has made the fensign of pilgrims, each one hastily 
endeavoured to readNUs home. The cause of their speed 
was the stendi of the unburied dead bodies, the fumes of 
which exhaled in such a manner as to infect the air itselfl 
^In consequence, a contagious pestilence spreading in the 
: jitmosphere, consigned to death many who had recently 
arrived. The rest quickened their march, by the cities on 
the coast, that is to say, Tiberias and Ciesarea Fhilippi ; for 
they were urged by scantiness of provision, and the fear of 
the enemy. Their want, as I have said, was remedied by 
the celerity of their march ; and to the fury of three hun- 
dred soldiers who harassed them from the town of Baldac, 
they opposed a military stratagem. For feigning a fl^ht 
for^a short time, that by leaviiig the narrow passes them- 
^ selves, they might induce the Tvi^ to enter them, they 

retreated purposely, and then retuildng, routed the strag- 
gling enemy at their pleasure. They had supposed our 
people unprepared for fight, as their shields and bows were 
] injured by the excessive rains ; not being aware^ that among 

2 " ' men, victory ^consists not in reliance on excellence of arms, 

j or of armour, but in the more noble- power of courage, and 

} of the well-nerved arm. 

J At that time, indeed, Baldwin returned safely to Edessa^ 

V and Boamund to Antioch. But in the b^ixming of the 

month of July, a vague report reached the ears of Baldwin,

Boamund being taken, and cast into chains, by one Danis- 
man, a heathen, and a potentate of that country. In con- 
sequence, collecting a body of the people of Edessa and 
Antioch, he was in hopes of revenging tins singular disgrace 
of the Christians. Moreoyer the Turk, who had taken this 
chieftain more by stratagem and chance than by courage or 
military force, as he had come with a small party to get 
possession of the city of Meletima, aware that the Franks 
would use their utmost efforts against him for the disgrace 
of the thing, betook himself to his own territories; mar- 
shalling his troops, not as though he intended to retreat, but 
rather to exhibit a triumph. Baldwin then proceeding two 
days' march beyond Meletima, and seeing the enemy decline 
the hazard of a battie, thought fit to return ; but &r8t, with 
the permission of Grabriel tiie govemor, brought over the 
city to his own disposal In the meantime, intelligence 
reaching hini of his brother's death, and of the general, 
consent of the inhabitants and chiefs to his election, he 
entrusted Edessa to Baldwin, his nearest relation by blood, 
and moreover a prudent and active man, and prepared for 
receiving the crown of Jerusalem. Wherefore collecting 
two hundred horse, and seven hundred foot, he proceeded 
on a march pregnant with death and danger ; whence many, 
who were mlisely supposed' faithful, contemplating the bold- 
ness of the attempt, clandestinely .deserted. He, with the 
remainder, marched forward, to Antioch, where from the 
resources of his sagacious mind, he became the cause of 
great future advantage to his distressed people, by advising 
them to choose Tancred as their chief. Thence, he came 
to Tripoli, by ther route of Gibesium and Laodicea. The 
governor of this city, a Turk by nation, but, from natural 
disposition, rich in bowels of mercy, afforded him the ne- 
cessary provisions without the walls; at the same time^ 
kindly intimatiDg, that he should act cautiously, as Ducach, 
king of Damascus, had occupied a narrow pass through 
which he had heaid he was to march. But he^ ashamed 
of being moved by the threats of the Saracen, resolutely 
proceeded on his destination. When he came to the place, 
he perceived the truth of the govemor^s information: for 
about five miles on this side the city of Berith, there is a 
very narrow passage near the sea, so confined by steep preci-

pioes, and narrow defiles, that were a hundred men to get 
possession of the entrance, they might prevent anj nmnber, 
however great, ^m passing. Such as travel from TripoK 
to Jemsalem have no possible means of avoiding it. Bald- 
win, therefore, arriving on the spot, sent out scouts to exa- 
mine the situation of the phice, and the strength of the 
enemy. The party returning, and hardly intelligible through 
fear, pointed out the difficulty of the pass, and the confidence 
of the enemy, who had occupied it But Baldwin, who fell 
Httle short of the best soldier that ever existed, feeling no 
ahum, boldly drew up his army and led it against them. 
Ducach then despatched some to make an onset, and lore 
the party unguardedly forward; retaining his main body 
in a more advantageous position. For this purpose, at first 
they rushed on with great impetuosity, and then made 
a feint to retreat, to entice our people into the defile. 
This stratagem could not deceive Baldwin, who, skilled by 
long-continued warfare, made a signal to his men to make 
show of flight ; and to induce a supposition that they were 
alarmed, he commanded the bag and baggage which they 
had cast down, to be again taken up, and the cattle to be 
goaded forwar<^ as well as the ranks to be opened, that the 
[ enemy might attack them. The Turks at this b^an to 
, exult, and, raging so horribly that . you might suppose the 
' Furies yelling, pursued our party. Some getting into ves- 
sels took possession of the shore, others riding forward began 
to kill such pilgrims as were incautiously loitering near the 
sea. The Franks continued their pretended flight till they 
reached a plain which they had before observed. No oonfri- 
sion deprived these men of their judgment ; even the very 
emergency by which they had been overtaken nurtured and 
increased their daring ; and though a small body, they with- 
stood innumerable multitudes both by sea and land. For ti^e 
moment it appeared they had sufficiently f<^gned alarm, thej 
closed their ranks, turned their standards, and hemmed in 
the now-charging enemy on aU sides, llius the face of 
affairs was changed, the victors were vanquished, and the 
vanquished became victors. The Turks were hewn down 
with dreadful carnage ; the remainder anxiously fled to their 
vessels, and when they had gotten more than a bow-shot out 
to sea, they still ui^ed them forward as fiercely with their

oars, as though thej supposed they could be drawn back to 
land by the arm of their adversaries. And that you may 
not doubt of this miracle as fanciful, but as evident, feel it as 
it were, only four Christian soldiers fell in procuring by their 
blood this victory to the survivors. Wherefore I assert, that 
the Christians would never be conquered by the pagans,^ 
were they to implore the Divine assistance on their courage, 
ere they entered the conflict ; and, when in battle, condliata^ 
the friendly powers of heaven to their arms. But since, in 
peace they glut themselves in every kind of vice, and in bat- 
tle rely only upoSTIEeir couf&ge 5 ttiereforfe it justly happens, 
that tiieir valour is often unsuccessful. The earl then, re- 
joicing in his splendid victory, on returning to spoil the slain, 
found several Turks alive, whom he dismissed without per- 
sonal injury, but despoiled them of their wealth. To avoid 
any hidden stratagem, he that night retreated with his party, 
and rested under the shelter of some olive trees. Next day, 
at dawn, he approached the defile, with the Hght troops, .to 
be an eye-witness of the nature of the place ; and, finding 
everytlung safe, and making a signal by smoke, as had been 
agreed upon, he intimated to his associates the departure of 
the enemy ; for the Turks, who the day before were wan- 
tonly galloping around the hill, perceiving the carnage of their 
companions, had all fled in the dead of the night. Laying 
aside every delay, they instantly followed their commander. 
The- governor of Berith sent them food on their march, as- 
tonished at the valour of so small a force. The Tyrians and 
Sidonians, and Accaronites, who are also called Ptholoamites, 
acted in the same manner, venerating with silent apprehen- 
sion the bravery of the Franks. Nor were Tancred's party, 
in Caiphas, less generous, although he was absent The 
ancient name of this town I am unable to discover ; because 
all the inland cities, which we read of in Josephus as for- 
merly existing, are either not in being, or else, changed into 
inconsiderable villages, have lost their names ; whereas those 
on the coast remain entire. In this manner, by Caesarea of 
Palestine, and Azotus, they came to Joppa. Here he was 
first congratulated on his kingdom, the citizens with great 
joy opening the gates to him. 

Being afterwards accompanied by the inhabitants of Joppa 
to Jerusalem, where he was favourably received, he indulged

in a repose of seven days' continaance. Thai, that the 
Turks might be convinced that the spirit of his reign would 
proceed to their signal disadvantage, he led his troops to- 
wards Ascalon. When at a short distance from that citj, 
he proudly displayed his forces, and with very little exertion 
compelled the attacking ABcalonites to retreat, by waiting a 
favourable opportunity for accomplishing his designs. Fi- 
nally, conceiving his glory satisfied for that time by their 
repulse, he drew off to the mountains to pursue the enemy, 
and also at their expense to procure necessaries for his troops, 
who were famished with hunger from the barrenness of the 
land : for a scanty harvest had that year denied sustenance ; 
deceiving the expectations of the province by a meagre pro- 
duce. He ascended therefore the mountainous districts, 
whither the Turkish inhabitants of the country had re- 
treated on leaving their towns^ concealing the Syrians with 
them in sequestered caverns. The Fhmks, however, dis- 
covered a mode of counteracting the device of the fugitives, 
by letting smoke into their hiding-places ; by which the mis- 
creants were dislodged, and came out one by one. The 
Turks were killed to a man ; the Syrians spared. The army 
turning aside thence, and marching towainls Arabia, passed 
by the supulchres of the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and 
Jacob ; and of their three wives, Sarah, Rebecca, and Leah. 
The place is in Hebron, thirteen miles distant from Jerusa- 
lem. For the body of Joseph lies at Neapolis, formerly 
called Sichem, covered with white marble, and conspicuoos 
to every traveller ; there, too, are seen the tombs of his bro- 
thers, but of inferior workmanship. The army then came 
into the valley where Grod formerly overthrew Sodom and

lake there extends for eighteen miles, incapable of support- 
ing any living creature, and so horrible to the palate, as to 
distort the mouths of such as drink it, and distend their jawi^ 
with its bitter taste. A hill overhangs the valley, emitting, 
in various places, a salt scum, and all over transparent, as it 
were, with congealed glass. Here is gathered what some 
call nitre ; some caU it crystal salt. Passing the lake, they

Every thing else had heen taken away, through the alarm of 
the inhahitants, *^except a few Ethiopi^a^^jlankjaEOol of . 
whose hair resembled smut. Our people, thinking it beneath \^ ..i^^ 
their valour to kill persons of this description, treated them, ^''\^ 
not with indignation, but with laughter. Adjacent to this ; 
town is a valley, where to this day is seen the rock which -^ 
Moses struck, to give water to the murmuring tribes. The 
stream yet runs so plentifully, and with such a current, as to 
turn the machinery of mills. On the declivity of the hill 
stands a church in honour of the legislator Aaron : where, 
through the mediation and assistance of his brother, he used 
to hold converse with God. Here learning from guides con- 
versant in the roads, who &om Saracens had been converted 
to Christianity, that from hence to Babylon was all barren 
country, and destitute of every accommodation, they returned 
to Jerusalem, to consecrate to God the first fruits of his 
reign, acquired in the subjugation of so many hostile coun* 
tries. 

The royal insignia being prepared, Baldwin was crowned ^ 
with great ceremony, in Bethlehem, on Christmas-day, by 
Daibert the patriarch ; all wishing him prosperity. For 
both, at that time, and afterwards, he deserved, by his own 
exertions, and obtained, through the favour of others, every 
degree of royal respect, though sovereign of a very small, 
and I had almost said, a despicable kingdom. Wherefore 
the Christians ought to regard the mercy of our Lord Christ, 
and to walk in the contemplation of his power, through 
-whose assistance they were objects of apprehension, though 
unable to do harm. For there were scarcely, in the whole 
service, four hundred horsemen and so many foot, to garrison _ 
Jerusalem, Ramula, Caiphas, and Joppa. For those who 
came thither by sea, with minds ill at ease, amid so many 
hostile ports, alter having adored the saints, determined to 
return home, as there was no possibility of proceeding by 
land. Moreover, an additional difficulty was, that in the 
month of March Tancred had departed to assume the govern- 
ment of Antioch, nor could he or the king aid each other 
from the length of the journey : indeed, should necessity re- 
quire it, he could not, without fear of irreparable loss, march 
hia troops from one town to another. I pronounce it there-

brotection, he was an object of dread to such a multitude of 

this year, which was a.d. 1 101, the sacred fire,* which 
used to signalize the Vigil of Easter, delayed its appearance 
longer than usuaL For on the Saturday, the lessons being 
read, alternately in Greek and Latin, the " !^Tie,£lfie8on'*t 
repeated thrice and the melody of the clarions resounding, 
still when no fire appeared, and the setting sun induced the 
evening and led on the night, then all departed sorrow^ to 
their homes. It had been determined, after mature delibe- 
ration, that on that night no person should remain in the 
church of the Holy Sepulchre, for fear any one of infected 
conscience should irritate God still more through his irreve- 
rent intrusion. But when the twilight was proceeding into 
day, a procession of the Latins was ordered to go to the 
Temple of Solomon, that by prayer they might caU down 
the mercy of God: the same was performed around the 
Sepulchre of our Lord, by the Sjrrians plucking their beards 
and hair through violence of grief. The mercy of Grod 
could endure no longer, light being instantly sent into one 
lamp of the Sepulchre. Which, when a Syrian perceived 
glittering through a window, he expressed his joy by the 
clapping of his hands, and accelerated the advance of the 
patriarch. He, opening the recess of the sepulchral ciiam- 
her by the keys which he carried, and lighting a taper, 
brought forth the celestial gift,^ imparting it to all who 
crowded round him for that purpose ; afterwards the whole 
of the lamps, throughout the church, were divinely lighted 
up, the one which was next to be illumined evincing its 
approaching ignition by emitting smoke in a miraculou^ 
manner. Thus, doubtless, the constant manner of Christ 
lias been to terrify those he loved that he might again kindly 
soothe them, and that the dread of his power might redound 
to his praise. For since even the common gifts of Grod are

might be more gratefully regarded. ^ 

At that time a fleet of Grenoese and IKsans had touched at 
Laodicea, and thence made a prosperous yoyage to Joppa, 
and the crews, drawing their vessels on shore, spent Easter 
with the king at Jerusalem. He, bargaining for their ser- 
vices, engag^ to give them the third of the spoil of each 
city they should tf&e, and any particular street they might 
choose. Thus he impelled them, inconsiderate and blinded, 
more through lust of gold than love of Gk)d, to barter their 
blood, and lay siege immediately to Azotus, which they con- 
strained to surrender after three days. Nor did the towns- 
}»eople yield very reluctantly, as they feared the anger of the 
king should they be taken by storm : for, the preceding year, 
assisted by the machination of fortune, they had vigorously 
repulsed Grodfrey when making a similar attempt For, 
indeed, when by means of scaling ladders he had advanced 
his forces on the walls, and they, now nearly victorious, had 
gotten possession of the parapet, the sudden fall of a wooden 
tower, which stood close to the outside of the wall, deprived 
them of the victory and killed many, while still more were 
taken and butchered by the cruelty of the Saracens. Leav- 
ing Azotus, Baldwin laid si^e to Csesarea of Palestine, with '^ 
his whole force, and with determined courage ; but perceiv- 
ing the resolution of its citizens and the difficulty of the 
enterprise, he ordered engines to be constructed. Petraries* 
"Were therefore made, and a great tower built of twenty cubits

however, impatient of delay and of such lingering expecta- 
tion, erecting their ladders and attempting to overtop the

with conscious valour indignantly raging, that they had now 
been occupied in conflict with the Saracens during fifteen 
days, and had lost the whole of that time ; and although the 
Ccesareans resisted with extreme courage, and rolled down 
large stones on them as they ascended, yet despising all dan- 
ger, they broke through their opponents in a close body, and 
fought with an outstretched arm, and a drawn sword. The

Turks, unable longer to sustain the attack and taking to 
flight, either cast thenuselrea down headlong, or fell bj the 
himd of their enemies. Many were reserved for slaveiy ; a 
few for rans<»n. Among these was the governor of the city, 
and a bishop named Arcadius. The scene was enough to 
excite laughter in a bj-stander, to see a Turk disgorging 
bezants,* when struck on the ned: bj the fist of a Christian. 
The wretched males, through fear of extreme indigence, bad 
hid money in thdr mouths ; the females in parts not to be 
particularized: you perceive that my narrative blushes to 
speak plainly, but the reader understands what I wish, or 
rather what I wish not to speak. 

Still, however, the emperor of Babylon could not be at 
rest, but would frequently send commanders and armies to 
attack the Franks. Arriving at Ascalon on ship-board, they 
scoured about Ramula, taking advantage of the king's occu- 
pation, who was then busied in the contest with CsBsarea. 
They frequently, therefore, by depopulating the country, 
irritated him to engage. But he, with equfli subtlety, that 
their mad impetuosity might subside, suffered them, when 
eagerly advancing, to grow languid by declining battle. By 
this procrastination he effected that many, weary of delay, 
withdrew, while he attacked the remainder, consisting of 
eleven thousand horse and twen1y*one thousand in&ntiy, 
with his own two hundred and fifty cavalry and less than 
seven hundred foot. Addressing a few words to his soldiers, 
to whom he pledged victory if they persevered, and fame if 
they fell ; and calling to their recollection that if tiiej fled 
France was a great way off, he dashed first against the 
enemy ; and the contest continuing for some time, when he 
saw his ranks giving way, he remedied circumstances which 
seemed almost bordering on desperation. Thus dismaying

torn. iv. 845. This practice of swallowing monej is referred to hj pope

the Turks hj his well-known appearance, he laid their leader 
prostrate with his lance ; on whose death the whole battalions 
ded. Our soldiers, who in the onset were so hemmed in as 
to be unable to see each other, then exercised their valour in 
such wise, under the ensign of the Holy Cross which pre- 
ceded them, that they kiUed fiye thousand. Eighty of the 
cavalry and ratheiL-iagre of the infantry were slain on the 
side of the Franks. However subsequent successes consoled 
them, as they despatched five hundred Arabian horse. These 
had been traversing before Joppa for two days, but effecting 
little, they were returning to Ascalon, and seeing our troops 
at a distance, and, hoping they were their own, were ap- 
proaching to congratulate them on their victory. But at 
length perceiving, by the weapons hurled against them, that 
they were Franks, they turned pale and, to use the words of 
the poet,* became like him who^ 

" With unshod foot, had trod upon a snake." 

In consequence, enervated with astonishment, they exposed 
their backs to their destroyers. Thus the king coming to 
Joppa, corrected, by a true account, the &lsity of the letter 
which had been sent to Tancred by the people of that dty, 
erroneously declaring that the king had perished with Ms 
army. And, indeed, already had Tancred prepared for his 
march to Jerusalem, when a messenger arriving, and show- 
ing the royal signet, dispelled his sorrow, and restored his 
satis&ction. 

It would be tedious, if I were to relate all his contests ; 
to tell how he subdued Tiberias, Sidon, Accaron, that is, 
Ptolemais, and, ultimately, all the cities on the coast ; or, 
how he distinguished almost each day by the slaughter of 
the Turks, either through secret attack or open warfare. 
The relation of his exploits requires the exclusive labours 
of a man who abounds in pompous diction, and undisturbed 
leisure : I have neither ; and, what chiefly acts as an obstacle, 
want dear information on the sulgect /or it is by no means 
the part of an historian of veraaty to give entire credit to 
flattering reports, or to deceive the credulity of his readers. 
Consequently, I shall only subjoin what I have found 
recorded, whereby this man's exalted devotion may be

408 WILUAH OP MALMESBUBT. [B.iT.c.t. 

dearly proved, and his good report live for ever. Tliis I 
maj be bold to assert, that he often, with an inconsiderable 
force, engaged in mighty conflicts, and that he never fled the 
field, except at Bamala and at Accaron. And indeed signal 
victories ensaed to each of these flights, because they pro- 
ceeded more firom rash valour, than £rom fear ; as the read^ 
will discover from the insertion of a few facts. 

In the month of September, on the seventh before the ides 
of which the battle aforesaid took place, William, earl of 
Poitou, proceeded towards Jerusalem, leading with him 
troops estimated at sixty thousand horse and still more foot 
There accompanied him, Stephen, earl of Burgundy, and 
Hugh de Lusignan, brother of earl Raymond, Hugh the 
Great, and Stephen of Blois, anxious to atone for the 
disgrace of their former desertion, by renovated and 
determined valour. Proceeding, therefore, by Constanti- 
nople, after he had by an insolent answer, as I before 
related, offended Alexius, he fell into the snares of 
Solyman ; the emperor rather procuring than preventing 
his disaster. For Solyman, aware that the army was 
suflering from hunger and thirst, as they had been 
wandering about the marshes and desolate places for 
several days, encountered them with three hundred thousand 
archers. Never was there conflict more disastrous to the 
Franks ; as it was impossible for flight to save the coward, 
or courage to rescue the bold from danger : for the battle 
was fought in a confined situation, and nothing could prevent 
the effect of clouds of arrows on men who were crowded 
together. More than a hundred thousand were slain ; and 
all the booty carried off. Thus Solyman, obtaining splendid 
offerings to the manes of his countrymen from the spoils of 
the Franks, revenged the loss of Nice. But, as they had 
proceeded by many roads, all were not slain ; nor was every 
thing plundered. For, except the Poitevin, who lost nearly 
whatever he possessed, the other earls had boldly defended 
their baggage. All, therefore, except Hugh the Great, who 
died, and was entombed in the city of Tarsus, collecting again 
their soldiers after the flight, hastened to Antioch. Tancred, 
a knight of celebrated kindness, gave them ample proof of 
his generosity; assisting them al^ as far as he was able, with 
money : but more especially William, whom the inconatancy

of Fortune had now as deeply depressed as slie bad formerly 
highly exalted, who, in addition to the loss of treasure, by 
which he was not so much affected as it was transitory and 
capable of reparation, was left almost the sole survivor of so 
many valorous soldiers. Proceeding on their march with 
renovated courage, they sought every opportunity of giving 
battle. The city of Tortosa was the first to feel their rage ; 
by attacking and plundering which, they in some degree 
compensated their former losses. Thence they came to the 
defile, which I have mentioned above, where the king had 
long awaited them, in order to give assistance in case the 
Turks should oppose their passage. Defended by his valour, 
and meeting with kind entertainment at Joppa, they pro- 
ceeded the following Easter to Jerusalem, where they 
joyfully beheld, and reverently adored the sacred fire. 
Returning afterwards to Joppa, they took ship, each 
designing to revisit his native land. The Poitevin, from 
the continued favour of the wind, reached home ; the rest 
were violently driven back. 

But now, in the beginning of May, the Turks and Arabs 
laid siege to Bamula ; recruiting the losses of their army in 
the former year, by making up its original numbers. The 
bishop of the city, prudently watching an opportunity, 
retired from the place and went secretly to Joppa. Baldwin 
had already gone out, relying on a fidse assertion that the 
enemy did not exceed five hundred ; in consequence of 
which, he neither put his forces in order, nor called out his 
infantry, the trumpeters merely sounding for the cavalry to 
follow the king ; though his friends earnestly advised him, to 
be on his guard against the subtlety of the Turks. The two 
Stephens, of Blois and of Burgundy, followed the king on 
horseback, that, instead of being branded as indolent and 
cowardly, they might return to their respective homes 
partakers of the credit of the triumph : far different, 
however, from their expectations, were the glory and the 
victory which the fates were preparing for them. For 
Baldwin, perceiving the multitude of the enemy and 
finding himself deceived in his opinion, filled with rage, 
and fierce in conscious valour, hesitated what was to be 
done. If he gave way, he contemplated the tarnish of his 
ancient glory ; if he fought, the destruction of his followers. 



410 TTILLIAU OF IfALMESBUBT. [b.it.c.2. 

Neverthdieas, innate counge prevailed, and fear had already 
yielded, when, swayed by the advice of his oomrades, he 
acquiesced in a plan of retiring, through the midst of the 
enemy, into a castle. The rest> following with loud damonr, 
broke through the thickest ranks, consecrating their souls to 
Grod, and nobly avenging their deaths. The earls, too^ so 
wearied with striking that their hands grew stiff upon their 
swords, yielded to &te. The king escaping to the fortress, 
had some few companions remaining out of the two hundred 
he had led forth ; who entreating that he would deign to 
protract his life by flight, and observing that their danger 
was of little consequence to the world, while his life was of 
advantage to many, in as much as he would be an example 
of valour to every age, by his singular constancy of mind 
though in adverse circumstances, he esteemed himself worthy 
to live. Wherefore, accompanied by five knights, he eluded 
his assailants, and escaped to the mountains. One of the 
five was Bobert the Englishman, as I said before ; the 
others, &om the great distance, report has not brought to 
our knowledge : he, with three more, was taken ; the fifth 
escaped with the king. The Turks vented the whole of 
their fury on those who had retired to the castle, among 
whom was Hugh de Lusignan and Greofirey de Yincennes : 
only three survivors told their mournful tale to the people of 
Jerusalem. The king, concealing himself during the day, 
and, at night, urging his jaded courser through untrodden 
paths, arrived at Azotus, by the singular and miraculous 
protection of God; as the Turks had but just departed, 
after having been plundering around the city for the space 
of two days. Coming thence by sea to Joppa, he despatched 
an account of the certainty of his being still living to the 
people of Jerusalem. The bearer of the epistle was a low 
Syrian fellow, who, even had he been discovered, would 
have deceived the enemy, from the meanness of his garb^ 
and his using the oonmion language of the country. 
Escaping the hands of the infidds by lone paths with 
which he was acquainted, he arrived the third day at 
Jerusalem. Upon this the cavalry who garrisoned the 
city, taking with them the bands of aus^ary infantry, 
and purposing to proceed to Joppa, took a route close to 
the sea i avoiding the inhind districts. The rear, however.

of the party, were cut off, by the Turks pressing on them ; 
as they were left unprotected either by horse or foot Thus 
collecting ninety horse from Jerusalem, and eighty from 
Tiberias, which Hugh, that most intrepid conunander, had 
brought to their assistance, the attendants also, through 
necessity, were advanced to the rank of knights. The 
battle was delayed only till the next day, the Turks being 
now so ferocious as to prepare their engines, and to meditate 
an attack on the walls of Joppa. This was prevented by 
the activity of Baldwin, and by the cross of Christ preceding 
them, which had been wanting in the former battle. They 
then, with all the force of the kingdom, rushed eagerly on 
the enemy, and the contest was fierce : but they, after tiieir 
usual custom, surrounding our troops, thought they had 
completely overcome the Christians, and shouted with 
cfae^ul cry : but the Lord Jesus was present ; who^ at 
length looked down from heaven, and showering courage 
on the Franks, put the enemy, driven from the field, to 
fiight. It had happened in die preceding action, that, 
though frequently driven from their tents, they afterwards 
conquered ^ux)ugh their numbers ; but now, as the infantry 
wounded them from a distance with their arrows, and the 
cavalry dose at hand with their lances, they placed all their 
hopes in swiftness, and continued their flight. 

He fought another battle in later years, in which our 
soldiers, pressed by the numbers of the Turks and compeUed 
to fly, lost even their protecting standard. But after they 
had fled some distance they rallied; shame animating the 
timid to repel such ignominy. Then indeed the contest was 
strenuous ; fighting foot to foot, and breast to breast. Our 
party recovered the cross, routing the enemy, and regaining 
the field. Many fell here with whom I had been acquainted ; 
among these was Grodfrey, Baldwin's bastard-grand-nephew, 
who, from a boy, manifested valour in his countenance and 
truth in his souL In the beginning, indeed, both retreats, as 
it may be said, were the source of ignominy; but, in the 
end, true food for glory ; the one more celebrated, the other 
more advantageous. Finally, to repair his losses, and also 
to be united with him in marriage, the countess of Sicily 
came shortly after to Jerusalem, pouring such treasures into 
the royal palace, that it was matter of surprise, whence a 



412 WILLIAM OF 1UXMB8BUBT. [b.it.c.L 

woqian could accumulate such endless heaps of predoas 
utensils :* and at this time, indeed, he received her to his bed, 
but shortly after he put her awaj. It is said that she was 
afflicted with a cancerous complaint, which prejed upon her 
womb.f This, however, is well known, that the king had 
no issue ; nor is it wonderful, that a man, to whom leisure 
was burdensome, should be averse to the embraces of a wife, 
as he passed all his time in war. Bj these exertions he 
effected^ that his admirable and nearly godlike valour should 
operate as an incitement to the present race, and be matter 
of astonishment to posterity. He died, during an expedition 
into Arabia, in the month of April, and was publicly buried 
at Jerusalem, near his brother, as the fourth month was 
adding to the seventeenth year of his reign. He was a man 
who gained his reputation by repeated labours, and on w^hose 
fame envy hath cast no shade, except it be, that he was too 
sparing of his money; though there is a ready and well- 
founded excuse for such a fault, if it be considered, that the 
necessary largesses to such as remained with him, prevented 
him &om purchasing the favour of those who departed. 

He was succeeded by his kinsman, Baldwin, prince of 
Edessa, already celebrated for his former campaigns, whom 
he had, when dying, named as king. He bravely defended 
the kingdom for many years, and augmented it with the sove- 
reignty of Antioch, which he obtained when Roger, { the son 
of Richard, was killed. He governed both countries with 
laudable conduct ; with less presumptuous haughtiness^ per-

being extremely ill and thinking he should not survive, recollected that he 
had another wife living, to whom he had been previously married at

baps, but with great and consummate prudence, th&ugh 
there are some who wound his fair fame, accusing him of 
excessive parsimony. Wherefore, last jear, when the Turks 
had taken him, while riding a short distance from Jerusalem, 
his people grieved but little for him, and for nearly a year 
it remained unknown, both to subjects and even to tale- 
bearers, whither he was taken, or whether or not he breathed 
the vital air. However, the people of Jerusalem, nothing 
discoursed on account of his absence, refused either to elect 
a king or to discontinue the order or command of the 
soldiers, till the certainty of the matter could be known. At 
last, the place where he lay captive being discovered, some 
knights of surpassing boldness, assuming the guise of mer- 
chants, and hiding weapons beneath their garments, entered 
the town, and rescued the king from jeopardy ; protesting, 
that they did not act thus through respect for his niggardli- 
ness, but out of gratitude to Gozelin of Turbexhel,* who 
never hesitated to bestow all he possibly could upon the 
military. He has now lived long, a provident man, and sub- 
ject to no other imputation. I The principality of Antioch 
pertains to the son of Boamund, of whom I proceed to speak. 
Boamund^ was the son of Robert Guiscard by a Norman 
woman ; he had another son named Roger, bom of an Apu- 
lian, who was, by his father, sumamed " Purse," because his 
paternal and attentive observation had discovered, that, from 
a mere child, he had pleasure in counting money. As to 
Boamund, who was somewhat older, he never could retain 
anything, but even gave away his childish presents. Roger, 
therefore, received Apulia, which seemed to belong to him 

* This account appears in lome measure incorrect. Gk)zelin and the 
king were both confined in the same castle. On its bdng seized Goacelin 
escaped, and collected troops to liberate his friends, who were now them- 
selves besi^ed. But ere his arrival, the Turks had made themselves 
masters of the fortress and carried off the king, who did not recover his 
liberty for some time, and then only by paying a considerable ransom.

t Boamund was bapti2<3 Mark; but his father healing a tale related 
of B giant named Buamund, gave him that appellation. When, alter his 
captivity, he returned to France, many of the nobility requested him to 
stand for their children; this he acquiesced in, and giving them his own 
name, it became frequent in these parts, though before nearly unknown in 
tha West. OnL Vital, p. 817

confidence of their walk, hoasted, that the dtj was called 
Durachiom,* hecause it coold endnre all edeges undiamajeA ; 
and ''I," said Goiscard, **am called Durandus; and I will 
endure in besi^ing, until I take awaj the name from the 
city; so that» henceforth it shall no longer be called Dura- 
chium, but MoUucium." The firmness of this answer so 
terrified them, that they immediately opened their gates. 
Thus, secure in his rear, he subdued, with the less difii" 
culty, the other cities as far as Thessalonica. He had now 
arrived there, and had already, both by himself and by his 
son, taught Alexius that he might be overcome, when, be- 
guiled by the treachery of his wife, he failed, by death, of 
a noble enterprise. Boamund, then, returning to Apulia, 
possessed some castles through his brother's indulgence, and 
acquired many others by Ms own courage and prudienoe. 
Indeed the dukedom had fallen to his brother only in ap- 
pearance; all the most warlike spirits following him. Nor 
was this of light importance : for, observant of his father's 
purpose, he was averse to Guibcrt, and strongly espoused 
the cause of Urban; urging him, when he^tating, to pro- 
ceed into France to the council of Clennont, whither the 
letters of Raymond earl of Provence, and of the bishop of 
Chorges, invited him* The council being ended, he readily 
embraced the opportunity, and transported his forces into 
Greece; and thence moving forward his army, he quietly 
awaited Raymond and Grodfrey. Joining them on their 
arrival, he possessed great influence from his military skill 
and from his courage, which was never surpassed. But, as 
what he performed in company with others, only entitles 
him to a share in the general praise ; and my former narra- 
tive has related how he had been taken prisoner ; it may be 
proper to mention in what manner he rescued himself from 
captivity. When Danisman perceived that no advantage 
resulted to him, from detaining so great a man in confine- 
ment, he changed his intentions, and began sedulously to treat 
of terms of peace; for he was neither inclined to put him

to death, lest he should excite the fierce hatred of the 
Christians against himself; nor would he set him at lihertj,* 
without the hope of a lasting peace. Boamund, therefore, 
promising the infidel perpetual amitj, returned to Antioch, 
bringing with him the silver fetters with which he had been 
confined; and being favourably received by his people, he 
took possession of Laodioea, and the other cities which Tan- 
cred, lest he should have been thought slumbering in indo- 
lence, whilst his uncle was sighing in prison, had acquired 
during his captivity. Not long a^r he came into France^ 
offering up, in honour of St Leonard, the chains with which 
he had been burdened; for this saint f is said to be so espe-^ 
dally powerful in loosing fetters, that the captive may freely 
carry away his chains, even in tiie sight of his enemies, who 
dare not mutter a syllable. He then married one of the 
daughters of the king of France, and sending another to 
Tancred, went to Apulia, followed by the French nobility, 
who deserted their country in hope of greater advantages, 
as well as to be eye-witnesses of what could be effected by 
that energetic valour, which was so universally extolled by 
fame. Wherefore arranging his affairs in Apulia, he again 
burst forth against Alexius ; alleging as a cause of attacking 
him, his cruelty to the crusaders, for which he was very 
noted. But being deceived by the subtlety of the emperor, 
who alienated his commanders from him by bribery, or took 
them off by poison, he had little or no success. Dejected at 
this, he returned to Apulia, where, in a few days, while pur- 
posing to proceed to Antioch, he died, not an old man, yet 
equal to any in prudence, leaving a son of tender age. He 
was a man firm in adversity, and circumspect in prosperity ; 
for he had even provided himself an antidote, when apprc'^ 
hensive of poison. It was a knife, which, placed before him 
when eating, strange to tell, indicated, by the moistness of

and which has quite a romantic air. 

f Leonard was godson to Clovis king of Ftance, and obtained, through 
the favour of that monarch, thai, whenever he should see any one who 
waa in chains, he should imme^atelj be set at liberty. At length it 
pleased God to honour him to that degree, that, if any person in contine- 
ment invoked his name, their chains immediately fell off, and they might 
depart; their keepers themselves having no power to prevent them. Vide

After him Tancred presided ovej^ Antioch ; a nephew worthj 
of such an unde. Tancred was removed Irom this world hj 
an early death, and Roger the son of Richard succeeded. 
Though rivalliug the fame of his predecessors in battle, jet 
he incurred the disgrace of being avaricious. In conse- 
quence of this, when the soldiery avoided him, he engaged 
the Turks with a trifling stipendiary, and a small native 
force, and fell nobly revenging his death: for being taken 
by them, stripped of his armour, and commanded to yield 
up his sword ; he refused to deliver it to any but the com- 
mander, as he considered all present unworthy to receive the 
surrender of so dignified a character. The unhappy chief 
gave credit to his specious words, and taking off his hehnet, 
stretched out his hand to receive Roger's sword. When, 
indignant, and mustering all his remaining powers for the 
effort, he cut off the Turk's head, and being immediately 
stabbed, escaped the disgrace of slavery by the act his 
courage had suggested. Baldwin the second, king of Jeru- 
salem, revenging his death in a signal manner, faithfully 
reserved the dominion of the city, and his daughter, for 
Boamund the son of Boamund. 

Raymond was the son of the most noble William,* earl of 
Toulouse, who, being a man of enterprise and ability, ren- 
dered his country, which had been obscured through the in- 
dolence of his predecessors, illustrious by his own good 
qualities. His wife Almodis was repeatedly married to dif- 
ferent persons, and had a numerous issue by them all; a 
woman of such sad, unbridled lewdness, that, when one hos- 
band became disgusting to her from long intercourse, she 
would depart and take up her abode with another : to sum 
up all, she had been first united to the earl of Aries ; pre- 
sently, becoming weary of him, she connected herself with 
William; and then after bearing him two sons, she lured 
the earl of Barcelona to marry her. Moreover, William. 
when at the point of death, gave to his son of his own name 
but not of his own disposition, the county of Toulouse, be- 
cause, though he was of slender talents, the people of Tou- 
louse would attempt no innovation against him, as they were 
accustomed to the government of his family. But Raymond,

who was of brighter abilities, received Chorges, and increased 
it wonderfally by the addition of Aries, Narbonne, Froyenoe, 
and Idmoges. Again, he purchased Toulouse of his brother 
who went to Jerusalem many years previous to the grand 
crusade ; but these things were achieved by a considerable 
lapse of time, and a life expended on the labour. Thus, 
ever engaged in war, he had no desire for a legitimate wife, 
enjoying himself in unrestrained concubinage. Finally, he 
condescended to honour with his adoption and inheritance, 
Bertrand, his son by one of his mistresses, as he, in some 
respects, resembled his father. To this son he married the 
niece* of Matilda the marchioness, a native of Lombardy, 
that by such affinity he might secure his possessions on that 
side. In the latter part of his life, too, he himself espoused 
the daughter of the ^king of Tarragona, covenanting for a 
noble dowry ; namely, the perpetual peace of the adjacent 
provinces. Soon after this, on contemplating his grey hairs, 
he made a vow to go to Jerusalem, that his bodily powers, 
though decayed and feeble, might still, though late, enter 
into the service of Grod. The chief promoter of this was 
the bishop of Chorges, by whose especial exertions he had 
always been thwarted, and in one contest, had even lost an 
eye, which mark of deformity, so far from concealing, he 
was ever anxious to show, boasting of it as a proof of his 
gallantry. But now, leagued in mutual friendship, that they 
might employ their old age in religious services, they stimu- 
lated Urban, already inclined to preach the crusade, to pass 
the Alps and summon a council at Clermont, more especially 
as it was a city adjacent to their territories, and convenient 
for persons coming from every part of France. The bishop, 
however, died on his way to the council. To his influence 
succeeded the bishop of Fuy, of whom we have before spo- 
ken: aninukted by whose advice, and protected by whose 
assistance, Raymond was the first layman who assumed the 
cross ; making this addition to his vow, " that he would never 
return to his country, but endeavour to lessen the weight of 
his past offences by perpetual exertion against the Turks." 
He had already given many proofs of lus prowess on the 
way, — ^the first to labour and the last to rest ; many also of

forbearance, as he readilj relinquished those places he had 
first occupied at Antioch to Boamund, and the tower of Da- 
vid to Grodfrej. But at length, his patience being worn out 
hy the unreasonable demands of certain persons, he departed 
from his usual practice on the subject of the surrender of 
Ascalon. For, on the first arrival of the Frakks, the towns- 
people, examining the disposition of our several commanders, 
made choice of him for their patron ; because many men, 
who had come thither before by sea, from Montpelier to trade, 
had extolled his sincerity and courage to the skies. In con- 
^ sequence, they delivered to him their keys, and compelled 
him to make oath that he would never give up the command 
of the city to any other of the Christians, should he himself 
be either unwilling or unable to retain it. A murmuring 
then arose among the chiefs, who required the surrender of 
the city to the king ; saying that his kingdom was of little 
value, unless he could hold Ascalon, which would be a recep- 
tacle for the enemy and an obstacle to our party. The 
king, indeed, set forth the matter mildly, as he did everything 
else, with a placid countenance consistent with his manners ; 
the others rather more violently. However, he paid little 
attention to their words, obviating their allegations by very 
substantial reasons ; saying that all his associates had secured 
a place of retreat ; part of them had returned home ; part 
were occupying the provinces they had acquired; that he 
alone, having abjured his native country, could neither re- 
turn thither, nor did he possess a place of refuge here ; that 
he had yielded in other points, but they must allow him to 
retain Ascalon, under fealty to the Holy Sepulchre, as he 
had taken an oath not to give it up. On hearing this, all 
began to clamour, and to call him interested and faithless ; 
indeed they could scarcely abstain from laying hands on him. 
The earl, indignant at this reproach, failed in the duty of a 
just and upright man, delivering the keys to the enemies of 
Grod, and compensating the fear of perjury by the blood of 
many a man in after time; for to this day that cify has 
never been taken either by force or by stratagem. 

Moreover, many of his people, delighted with the unbounded 
affluence of the place, obtained the friendship of its citizens by 
denying their faith. Thus leaving Jerusidem, he came to 
Laodicea, and having subdued it, continued there some little 



A.B.10M.] tahorbd's dsath. 410 

^ime. Afterwards, when he had gone to Constantinople^ 
Tancred obtained Laodicea, though it is dubious whether hj 
force or favour. In the meantime, remaining at Bjzantiomy 
he contrived by his consummate prudence to insinuate him- 
self into the iavour of Alexius. Whence it happened, that; 
through the kindness of the emperor, getting a safe passage, 
he escaped sharing those calamities which, as we have before 
related, befell William of Foitou and the others; with 
whom he took the city of Tortosa, and, when the rest pro- 
ceeded onwards, retained possession of it To extend his 
power, he fortified a town over against Tripoli, called Pil- 
grim's Castle, where he appointed abbat Herbert, bishop. 
And that the shattered strength of his followers might re- 
cruit by repose, he made a seven years' league with the 
Tripolitans. Nevertheless, ere the time appointed, the peace 
was broken, on account of a certain townsman being found 
within the castle, with a poisoned dagger concealed beneath 
his garments. And now truly would he have put the finish- 
ing hand to the conquest of Tripoli, had not death, approach- 
ing almost immediately, bereft his vital spirit, big with great 
achievements. On learning his decease, WUliam of Mont- 
pelier, and the other chie& of the province, provided that 
William the Pilgrim, scarcely four years of age, whom he 
had begotten on a Spanish woman during the siege, should 
be conveyed home, to be educated for the succession, with 
the anxious wishes of all. Nor did Bertrand hear of this 
transaction with displeasure, although he had never been 
consulted, as it enabled him to renew his father's fame. 
Wherefore, heading a vast army, and chiefly supported by 
the Grenoese and Pisans, who were allied to his wife, he 
attacked Tripoli by sea and land, and when exhausted by a 
protracted siege, reduced it to his dominion. To him suc- 
ceeded Pontius, his son by the Lombard ; a youth who 
rivalled the glory of his ancestors, and who obtained in 
marriage the relict of Tancred, formerly prince of AntiocL 
This, when dying, he had commanded ; affirming, that, the 
youth would grow up a benefit to the Christians, and an 
utter destruction to the Turks. Pontius therefore reigns at 
Tripoli, professing himself the servant of the Holy Sepulchre ; 
in this respect following the example of his grandfather and 
father.

420 WILLIAM OF HALMBSBUBT. CB.iT.c.t: 

Bobert, son of William the first king of England, was 
bom in Normandj, and already consider^ as a youth of ex- 
cellent courage, when his father came to England : of tried 
prowess, though of small stature and projecting belly. He 
passed his early y§ars amid the warlike troops of his father, 
obedient to him in every respect : but in the vigorous heat 
of youth, led by the suggestions of his idle companions, he 
supposed he could obtain Normandy from the king, during 
his lifetime. But when William refused this, and drove 
away the youth by the blustering of his terrific voice, Robert 
departed indignantly, and harassed his country by perpetual 
attacks. His father laughed at first, and then added, " By 
the resurrection of God, this little Robin Short-boot will be 
a clever fellow f for such was his appellation, from his 
small stature ; though there was nothing else to find £i,ult 
with ; as he was neither ill-made, nor deficient in eloquence, 
nor was he wanting in courage or resources of mind. At 
length, however, the king was so transported with anger, 
that he denied him his last blessing and the inheritance of 
England ; and it was with difficulty, and disgrace, that he 
coidd retain even Normandy. After nine years he gave 
proof of his manhood in the labours of the crusade, and in 
many instances appeared wonderful, as neither Christian, nor 
pagan could ever unhorse him : but more especially in the 
battle of Antioch, where he graced the victory by a singular 
achievement. For when the Turks, as we have related, 
were suddenly dismayed and fied, and our party vehemently 
attacked them in disorder, Corbanach, their leader, mindful 
of his native valour, checked his horse, and rallied his people ; 
calling them base slaves, and forgetful of their ancient con- 
quests, in sufiering themselves, the former conquerors of the 
east, to be driven from their territories by a strange, and 
almost unarmed people. At this reproach, many, resuming 
their courage, wheeled round, attacked the Franks, and com- 
pelled the nearest to give way, while Corbanach continued 
to animate his men, and to assault the enemy ; nobly fulfill- 
ing his duty, both as a commander and a soldier. But now 
the Norman earl and Philip the clerk, son of Roger, earl of 
Montgomery, and Warin de Taney, a castle so named in 
Maine, who had before made a feint of retreating, exhorting 
each other with mutual spirit^ turned round their l^orses^ and

each attacking his man, threw them to the ground. Here 
Ck>rbanach, though he knew the earl, yet estimating him 
merely by his size, and thinking it inglorious to fly, atoned 
for the boldness of attacking Mm, by a speedy exit ; being 
instantly deprived of life. The Turks, who were already 
clamouring with boastful joy, on seeing his fall, now lost 
their lately-acquired hopes, and redoubled their flight In 
this contest Warin fell : Robert, with Philip, gained the vic- 
tory. The latter, who acquired renown by this service, but 
afterwards, as they report, closed an honourable career at 
Jerusalem, was celebrated for his learning as well as his mili- 
tary prowess. Robert, thus coming to Jerusalem, tarnished 
his glory by an indelible stain, in refusing a kingdom,* 
offered to him, as a king's son, by the consent of all ; and 
this, as it is asserted, not through awe of its dignity, but 
through the fear of endless labour. However, returning 
home, where he had reckoned on giving himself up to the 
full indulgence of sensual pleasure, God mercifully visited 
him, as I believe, for this transgression ; every where 
thwarting him, and turning all his enjoyments into bitter- 
ness ; as will be manifested by the sequel. 

His wife, the daughter of William de Conversano, whom 
he had married in Apulia on his return, and whose surpass- 
ing beauty, all endeavours to describe are vain, died after a 
few years, by disease ;f misled, as it is said, by the advice of 
the midwife, who had ordered her breasts, when in child- 
bed, to be bound with a tight bandage, on account of the 
copious flow of her milk. A great consolation, however, in 
this extreme distress, was a son by his consort ; who, called 
William by presage of his grandfather's name, gave hope of 
noble talents hereafter. The immense sum which his father- 
in-law had given him, under the appellation of dowry, that

name, as refusing the crown. Henry of Huntingdon however records it, 
and Albertua Aquensis observes, that it was first offered to Raymond, earl 
of Toulouoe, who declining to accept it, and the other chiefs in succession 
following his example, Godfrey was, with difficulty, prevailed on to ascend 
the throne. Alb. Aquens. 1. vi c. S3, and Villebardouin, No. 136.

he might with it redeem Normandy,* he lavished so pio- 
faaelj on buffoons, and worthless people, that^ in a few days, 
he was pennjless. He accelerated his disgrace bj his ill- 
advised arrival in England, to wrest the kingdom from his 
brother Henry ; but, failing of the assistance of the traitors 
who had invited him, he easily yielded to his brother's terms 
of peace : which, by the agreement of the chiefs of either 
party, were, that, he should receive an annual present of 
three thousand marks from England. These were mere 
words : for the king had promised this without any design 
of fulfilling it ; but, aware of his brother^s easiness, had de- 
luded his soft credulity, till his warlike passion should sub- 
side. And he, too, as if contending with fortune whether 
she should give or he squander most, discovering the mere 
wish of the queen, silently intreating it, kindly forgave the 
payment of this immense sum for ever ; thinking it a very 
great matter, that female pride should condescend to ask a 
favour ; for he was her god&ther. Moreover he forgot 
offences, and forgave faults beyond what he ought to have 
done : he answered all who applied to him, exactly as they 
wished ; and that he might not dismiss them in sadnees, 
promised to give what was out of his power. By this suavity 
of disposition, with which he ought to have acquired the 
commendations and the love of his subjects, he so excited the 
contempt of the Normans, that they considered him as of no 
consequence whatever. For then, all the nobility falling at 
variance, plunder was universal, and the conmionalty were 
pillaged. Although the inhabitants laid their injuries be- 
fore the earl, they gained no kind of redress ; for though 
incensed at first, yet his anger was soon appeased, either by 
a trifling present, or the lapse of time. Boused, however, 
by the extremity of their distresses, they determined to implore 
the assistance of king Henry to their suffering country. Henry, 
according to Csesar's axiom,f " That if justice is ever to be 
violated, it ought to be violated in favour of the citizens, and 
that you may be observant of duty in other points," transported 
his forces several times into Normandy to succour expiring

justice, and at last was successful enough to subjugate the 
whole country, with the exception of Rouen, Falaise, and Caen. 
Robert was now reduced so low, as to wander, hardlj to be 
recognised, through these towns, obtaining a precarious sub- 
sistence from the inhabitants. Disgusted at this, the people 
of Caen did not long regard their fidelity, but sending mes- 
sengers to the king, they closed the gates of their city, with 
locks and bolts. Robert learning this, and wishing to escape, 
was hardly allowed to depart ; his attendant, with the fur- 
niture of his chamber, being detained. Thence flying to 
Rouen, he had a conference with his lord, the king of France, 
and his relation, the earl of Flanders, on the subject of 
assistance ; but obtaining none, he determined, as his last 
resource, to risk a general action. In which, through the 
persecution of fate, being taken prisoner, he was kept, by 
the laudable affection of Las brother, in free custody tUl the 
day of his death ; for he endured no eyil but solitude, if that 
can be called solitude where, by the attention of his keepers, 
he was provided with abundance both of amusement and of 
food. He was confined, however, till he had surriyed all 
his companions in the Crusade, nor was he liberated to the 
day of his death.* He was so eloquent in his native tongue, 
that none could be more pleasant ; in other men's affairs, no ' 
counsellor was more excellent ; in military skill equal to any ; 
yet, through the easiness of his disposition, was he ever 
esteemed imfit to have the management of the state. But since 
I have already said all that I knew of Hugh the Great, and 
of the earls of Blois and of Flanders, I think I may, very 
properly here conclude my Fourth Book.

BOOK V. 

PREFACE. 

SiiHHOKSD by the progress of events, we have entered cm * 
the times of king Henrj ; to transmit whose actions to pos- 
terity, requires an abler hand than ours. For, were only 
those particulars recorded which have reached our know- 
ledge, they would weary the most eloquent, and might over- 
load a library. Who, then, will attempt to unfold in detail 
all his profound counsels, all his royal achievements ? These 
are matters too deep for me, and require more leisure than I 
possess. Scarcely Cicero himself, whose eloquence is vene- 
rated by all the Western world, would attempt it in prose ; 
and in verse, not even a rival of the Mantuan Bard. -In 
addition to this, it is to be observed, that while I, who am a 
man of retired habits, and far from the secrets of a courl, 
withhold my assent from doubtful relators, being ignorant of his 
greater achievements, I touch only on a few events. Where- 
fore, it is to be feared, that where my information falls be- 
neath my wishes, the hero, whose numerous exploits I omit, 
may appear to suffer. However, for this, if it be a fault, I 
shall have a good excuse with him who shall recollect l^at I 
could not be acquainted with the whole of his transactions, 
nor ought I to relate even all that I did know. The insig- 
nificance of my condition effects the one ; the disgust of my 
readers would bo excited by the other. This fifth book, 
then, will display some few of his deeds, while fame, no 
doubt, will blazon the rest, and lasting memory transmit 
them to posterity. Nor will it deviate from the design of 
the preceding four, but particularise some things which hap- 
pened during his time here and elsewhere, which perchance 
are either unrecorded, or unknown to many : they will oc- 
cupy, indeed, a considerable portion of the volume, while I 
must claim the usual indulgence for long digressions, as well 
in this as in the others.

OS Henry the First. [a.d. 1 100— 1 129.] 

Hbkbt, the yotingest son of William the Great, was born in 
I^gland* the third year afler his father's arrival ; a child, 
even at that time, fondly cherished by the joint good wishes 
of all, as being the only one of William's sons bom in royalty, 
and to whom the kingdom seemed to pertain. The early 
years of instruction he passed in liberal arts, and so tho- 
roughly imbibed the sweets of learning, that no warlike 
commotions, no pressure of business, could ever erase them 
from his noble mind : although he neither read much openly, 
nor displayed his attainments except sparingly. His learn- 
ing, however, to speak the truth, though obtained by snatches, 
assisted him much in the science of governing ; according to 
that saying of Plato, " Happy would be the commonweidth, 
if philosophers governed, or kings would be philosophers." 
Not slenderly tinctured by philosophy, then, by degrees, in 
process of time, he learned how to restrain the people with 
lenity ; nor did he ever suffer his soldiers to engage but 
where he saw a pressing emergency. In this manner, by 
learning, he trained hia early years to the hope of the king- 
dom ; and often in his father^s hearing made use of the pro- 
verb, that "An illiterate king is a crowned ass." They 
relate, too, that his father, observing his disposition, never 
omitted any means of cherishing his lively prudence ; and 
that once, when he had been ill-used by one of his brothers, 
and was in tears, he spirited him up, by saying, " Weep not, 
my boy, you too will be a king." 

In the twenty-first year,f then, of his father's reign, when 
he was nineteen years of age, he was knighted by him at 
Westminster during Pentecost ; and then accompanying him 
to Normandy, was, shortly after, present at his funeral ; the 
other brothers departing whither their hopes led them, as my 
former narrative has related. Wherefore, supported by the 
blessing of his father, together with his maternal inheritance 
and immense treasures, he paid little regard to the haughti-

ness of his brothers ; assisting or opposing each of them as 
thej merited. More attached, however, to Robert for his 
mildness, he took every means of stimulating his remissness 
bj his own spirit Robert, on the other hand, through 
blameable credulity, trusting 'to tale-bearers, injured his inno- 
cent brother in a way which it may not be irrelevant briefly 
to relate. 

At the time when the nobility of England were rebelling 
against William the Second, while Robert was waiting a 
wind to sail over from Normandy, Henry had, by his com- 
mand, departed into Brittany ; when, eagerly seizing the 
opportunity, he expended on his troops all the large sum of 
money, amounting to three thousand marks, which had been 
bequeathed to the young man by the will of his father. 
Henry, on his return, though perhaps he endured this with 
difficulty, yet observed a cautious silence on the subject 
However, hearing of the restoration of peace in England, the 
service was ended, and they laid aside their arms. The earl 
retired to his own territories : Henry to those which his bro- 
ther had either given, or promised to give him. Indeed he 
placed his promises to account, retaining the tower of Rouen 
under fealty to Robert. But, by the accusation of some very 
infamous persons, his fidelity proved disadvantageous to him ; 
and for no fault on his part, Henry was, in this very place, 
detained in free custody, lest he should escape the vigilance 
of his keepers. Released at the expiration of half a year, on 
the invitation of his brother William he offered him his ser- 
vices ; but he, remunerating the young man no better, put 
him off, though in distress, with empty promises for more 
than a year. Wherefore, Robert, by his messengers, offering 
reparation for what had been done, he came to Normandy ; 
having experienced attempts on his person from each of his 
brothers. For the king, angry at his departure, had in vain 
commanded him to be detained : and the earl, swayed by the 
arts of his accusers, had changed his intention ; so that, 
when lured to him by soothing measures, he would not easily 
suffer him to depart. But he, escaping every danger by the 
providence of. God and his own prudent caution, compelled 
his brother gladly to accede to peace, by seizing Avranchea 
and some other castles. Soon after, William coming into 
Normandy to revenge himself on his brother Robert^ Henry

manifested his regard to the earl at Ronen. Finallj, the 
king's party coming thither in the day time, he spiritedly 
expelled them, when already, through the treachery of the 
citizens, they had over-run the whole city ; sending a mes- 
sage to the earl, to oppose them in front, while he pressed 
upon their rear. In consequence of this transaction, one 
Conan was accused of treachery to the earl ; who designed 
to cast him into chains : supposing that no greater calamity 
could be inflicted on the wretch, than dooming him to drag 
out a hated existence in prison. But Henry requested to 
have this Conan committed to his care ; which being granted, 
he led him to the top of the tower at Rouen, and ordering 
him carefully to survey the surroimding territory from the 
heights of the citadel, ironically declaring it should all be 
his, he thrust him suddenly off the ramparts into the Seine 
below ; protesting to his companions, who at the same time 
assisted him, that no respite was due to a traitor ; that the 
injuries of a stranger might be endured in some manner or 
other ; but that the punishment of a man who with an oath 
had done homage, when once convicted of perfidy, never 
should be deferred. This action weighed little with Robert, 
who was a man of changeable disposition, for he immediately 
became ungrateful, and compelled his deserving brother to 
retire from the city. This was the period in which, as has 
been before mentioned, Henry, as well for his security as for 
his fame, made a stand against both Robert and William at 
Mount St. Michael's. Thus, though he had been faithful 
and serviceable to either brother, they, vouchsafing no esta- 
blishment to the young man, trained him up, as he grew in 
years, to greater prudence, from the scantiness of his means. 
But on the violent death of king William, as before re- 
lated, after the solemnization of the royal funeral, he was 
elected king; though some trifling dissensions had first arisen 
among the nobility which were allayed chiefly through the 
exertions of Henry earl of Warwick, a man of unblemished 
int^rity, with whom he had long been in the strictest inti- 
macy. He immediately promulgated an edict throughout 
England, annulling the illegal ordinances* of his brother, 
and of Ranulph; he remitted taxes; released prisoners; 
drove the flagitious from court; restored the nightly use

of lights within the palace, which had been omitted in his 
brother's time;* and renewed the operation of the ancient 
lawByf confirming them with his own oath, and that of the 
nobilitj, that they might not be eluded. A jojful day then 
seemed to dawn on the people, when the light of fair pro- 
mise shone forth after such repeated clouds of distress. And 
that nothing might be wanting to the aggregate of happi- 
ness, Ranulf, the dregs of iniquity, was cast into the gloom 
of a prison, and speedy messengers were despatched to re- 
call Anselm. Wherefore, all vying in joyous acclamation, 
Henry was crowned king at London, on the nones of 
August, four days after his brother's death. These acts 
were the more sedulously performed, lest the nobility should 
be induced to repent their choice; as a rumour prevailed, 
that Robert earl of Normandy, returning from Apulia, was 
just on the point of arriving. Soon after, his friends, and 
particularly the bishops, persuading him to give up mere- 
tricious pleasures and adopt legitimate wedlock, he married, 
on St. Martin's day, Matilda,): daughter of Malcolm king of 
Scotland, to whom he had long been greatly attached ; little 
regarding the marriage portion, provided he could possess 
her whom he so ardently desired. For though she 'was of 
noble descent, being grand-niece of king Edward, by his 
brother Edmund, yet she possessed but little fortune, being 
an orphan, destitute of either parent; of whom there will 
be more ample matter of relation hereafter. 

In the meantime, Robert, arriving in Normandy, recovered 
his earldom without any opposition; on hearing which, al- 
most all the nobility of this country violated the fealty which 
they had sworn to the king : some without any cause ; some 
feigning slight pretences, because he would not readUy give 
them such lands as they coveted. Robert Fitz-Haymon, and 
Richard 'de Rivers, and Roger Bigod, and Robert earl of

t Matildk having taken the veil, though only for a purpose, scruples 
were raised as to the propriety of her entering the marriage state : a synod 
was therefore called at Lambeth by archbishop Anselm, and it was there 
determined that Matilda, not having voluntarily become a nun, mi^t

Mellent, with bis brother Hemy, alone declared on the side 
of justice. But all the others either secretly sent for Ro- 
bert to make him king, or openly branded their lord with 
sarcasms; calling him, Grodric,* and his consort^ Goddiva. 
Henry heard these taunts, and, with a terrific grin, deferring 
his anger, he repressed the contemptuous expressions cast on 
him by the madness of fools, by a studied silence; for he 
was a calm dissembler of his enmities, but, in due season, 
avenged them with fierceness. This tempest of the times 
was increased by the subtlety of Ranulf. For, concerting 
with his butler, he procured a rope to be sent him. The 
deceitful servant, who was water-bearer, carried him a very 
long one in a cask ; by which he descended from the wall of 
the tower, but whether he hurt his arms, or grazed the 
skin off his hands, is a matter of no importance.! Escaping 
thence to Normandy, he stimulated the earl, already indigo 
nant and ripe for war, to come to England without a mo- 
ment's delay. 

In the second year, then, of Henry's reign, in the month 
of August, arriving at Portsmouth, he landed, divided and 
posted his forces over the whole district. Nor did the king 
give way to indolence, but collected an innumerable army 
over against him, to assert his dignity, should it be neces- 
sary. For, though the nobility deserted him, yet was his 
party strong; being espoused by archbishop Aiiselm, with 
his brother bishops, and all the English. In consequence, 
grateful to the inhabitants for their fidelity, and anxious for 
their safety, he frequently went through the ranks, instruct- 
ing them how to elude the ferocity of the cavalry by op- 
posing their shields, and how to return their strokes. By 
this he made them voluntarily demand the fight, perfectly 
fearless of the Normans. Men, however, of sounder coun- 
sel interfering, who observed, that the laws of natural affec- 
tion must be violated should brothers meet in battle, they 
shaped their minds to peace ; refiecting, that, if one fdl, the 
other would be the weaker, as there was no surviving bro- 
ther. Besides, a promise of three thousand marks deceived

the easy credulity of the earl ; who imagined ihat, when he 
had disbanded his army, he might gratify his inclinations 
with such an immense sum of money: which, the very 
next year, he cheerfully surrendered to the queen's pleasure 
because she desired it. 

The following year Robert de Belesme, eldest son of 
Roger de Montgomery, rebelled, fortifying the castles of 
Bridgenorth and Arundel against the king ; carrying thither 
com from all the district round Shrewsbury, and every ne- 
cessary which war requires. The castle of Shrewsbury, too^ 
joined the rebellion, the Welsh being inclined to evil on 
every occasion. In consequence^ the king, firm in mind 
and bearing down every adverse circumstance by valour, 
collecting an army, laid siege to Bridgenorth, from whence 
Robert had ah'eady retired to Arundel; presuming from the 
plenty of provision and the courage of the soldiers, that the 
place was abundantly secure. But, after a few days, the 
townsmen, impelled by remorse of conscience and hj the 
bravery of the king's army, surrendered : on learning which, 
Arundel repressed its insolence; putting itself under the 
king's protection, with this remarkable condition; that its 
lord, without personal injury, should be suffered to retire 
to Normandy. Moreover, the people of Shrewsbary sent 
the keys of the castle to the king by Ralph, at that lime 
abbat of Sees, and afterwards archbishop of Canterbury, as 
tokens of present submission, and pledges of their future 
obedience. Thus, this fire of dissension which was ex- 
pected to become excessive, wasted to ashes in the course 
of very few days; and the avidity of the revolters, per- 
petually panting after innovation, was repressed. Robert, 
with his brothers, £mulph, who had obtained the surname 
of his father, and Roger the Poitevin, so called because he 
had married his wife from that country, abjured England for 
ever; but the strictness of this oath was qualified with a 
proviso, ''unless he should satisfy the king on some future 
occasion, by his obedient conduct" 

The torch of war now lighted up in Normandy, receiving 
fresh fuel by the arrival of the traitors, blazed forth and 
sei2sed every thing within its reach. Normandy, indeed 
though not very wide in its extent, is a conve^ie^t ^nd 
patient fosterer of the abandoned. Wherefore, fo^a long

time, she well endures intestine broils ; and on the restora- 
tion of peace, rises soon to a state more fruitful than before ; 
at her pleasure ejecting her disturbers, when detected bj the 
province, by an easy egress into France. Whereas England 
does not long endure the turbulent ; but when once received 
to her bosom, either surrenders, or puts them to death ; 
neither, when laid waste bj tumult, does she again soon rear 
her recovering head. Belesme, then, arriving in Normandy, 
bad, both at that time and afterwards, accomplices in his 
malignity, and lest this should seem too little, inciters also. 
Among others was William earl of Moreton, the son of Robert, 
the king's unde. He, from a boy, had been envious of 
Henry's fame, and had, more especially, on the arrival of the 
Norman, manifested his evil disposition. For not content 
with the two earldoms, of Moreton in Normandy, and Corn- 
wall in England, he demanded from the king the earldom 
of Kent, which Odo his unde had held ; so troublesome and 
presumptuous was he, that, with shameless arrogance, he 
▼owed, that he would not put on his doak till he could pro- 
cure the inheritance derived to him from his uncle ; for such 
was his expression. But even then the king, with his 
characteristic circumspection, beguiled him by the subtlety 
of an ambiguous answer. The tumult, however, being 
allayed and tranquillity restored, he not only refused assent 
to his demand, but persisted in recovering what he unjustly 
retained ; though he did it with moderation, and the sanction 
of law, that none of his actions might appear illegal, or con- 
trary to equity. William, ousted by the sentence of the law, 
retired, indignant and furious into Normandy. Here, in 
addition to his fruitless attacks upon the royal castles, he 
assailed Richard earl of Chester, the son of Hugh ; invading, 
plundering, and destroying some places which formed part of 
his possessions : the earl himsdf being at that time a minor, 
and under the protection and guardianship of the king. 

These two persons, then, the leaders of faction and fo- 
menters of rebellion, in conjunction with others whom I am 
ashamed to particularize, harassed the country, far and wide, 
with their devastations. Complaints from the suffering in- 
habitants on the subject of their injuries, though frequent, 
were lavished upon the earl in vain. He was moved by 
them, it is true ; but fearing on his own account, lest they 



432 wnxiAK or icaliixsbubt. t**^- 

should disturb his ease if offended, he dissembled his feelinga. 
King Henijy however, felt deeplj for his brother's infSunj, 
carried to the highest pitch by the sofferings of the country : 
aware, that it was the extreme of cruelty, and far from a 
good king's duty, to suffer abandoned men to riot on the 
property of the poor. In consequence, he c^ce admcHUshed 
his brother, whom he had sent for into England, with fair 
words ; but afterwards, arriving in Nonnandy, he severely 
reminded him, more than once, by arms, to act the prince 
rather than the monk. He also despoiled William, the insti- 
gator of these troubles, of every thing he had in England ; 
razing his castles to the ground. But when he could, even 
thus, make no progress towards peace, the royal migesty 
long anxiously employed its thoughts, whether, regardless <^ 
fraternal affection, it should rescue the country from danger, 
or through blind regard, suffer it to continue injeopanly. 
And indeed the common weal, and sense of right, would 
have yielded to motives of private affection, had not pope 
Paschal, as they say,* urged him, when hesitating, to the 
business by his letters : averting, with his powerful elo- 
quence, that it would not be a civil war, but a signal benefit 
to a noble country. In consequence, passing over,')' he, in ft 
short time, took, or more properly speaking, received, the 
whole of Normandy ; all flocking to his dominion, that be 
might provide, by his transcendent power, for the good of 
the exhausted province. Tet he achieved not this signal 
conquest without bloodshed ; but lost many of his dearest 
associates. Among these was Boger of Gloucester, a tried 
soldier, who was struck on the head by a bolt from a cros»' 
bow, at the siege of Falaise ; and Robert Fitz-Haymon, who 
receiving a blow on the temple, with a lance, and losing his 
faculties, survived a considerable time^ almost in a state d

idiotcy.* They relate, that he was thus desenredlj punished, 
because, for the sake of liberating him, king Henry had con- 
sumed the dtj of Bajeux, together witii the principal church, 
with fire. Still, however, aa we hope, they both atoned for 
it. For the king munificently repaired the damage of that 
church : and it is not easy to relate, how much Robert en- 
nobled, by his favour, the monastery of Tewkesbury ; where 
the splendour of the edifice, and the kindness of the monks, 
attract the eyes, and captivate the minds of the visitors. 
Fortune, however, to make up for the loss of these persons, 
put a finishing hand to the war, when at its height, and with 
little labour, gave his brother, when opposing him with no 
despicable force, together with William earl of Moreton, and 
Robert de Belesme, into his power. This battle was fought 
at Tenersebrey, a castle of the earl of Moreton's, on Saturday 
the Vigil of St. MichaeL It was the same day, on which, 
about forty years before, William had first landed at Hastings : 
doubtless by the wise dispensation of Grod, that Normandy 
should be subjected to l^gland on the same day that the 
Norman power had formerly arrived to subjugate that king- 
dom. Here was taken the earl of Moreton, who came thither 
to fulfil his promise of strenuous assistance to the townsmen, 
as well as in the hope of avenging his injuries. But, made 
captive, as I have related, he passed the residue of his life in 
the gloom of a prison ; meriting some credit from the viva- 
city of his mind, and the activity of his youth, but deserving 
an unhappy end, from his perfidy. Then, too^ Belesmef 
escaped death by fiight at the first onset ; but when, after- 
wards, he had irritated the king by secret faction, he also 
was taken ; and being involved in the same jeopardy with 
the others, he was confined in prison as long as he lived. He 
was a man intolerable from the barbarity of his manners, and 
inexorable to the faults of others ; remarkable besides for 
cruelty ; and, among other instances, on account of some 
trifling fault of its father, he blinded his godchild, who was

his hostage, tearing out the little wretch's e^es with his 
accursed nails : full of canning and dissimulation, he used to 
deceive the credulous by the serenity of his countenance and 
the afiability of his speech ; though the same means terrified 
those who were acquainted with his malignity ; as there was 
no greater proof of impending mischief, than his pretended 
mildness of address. 

The king, thus splendidly successful, returned triumphant 
to his kingdom, having established such peace in Normandy 
as it had never known before ; and such as even his father 
himself, with all his mighty pomp of words and actions, had 
never been able to accomplish. Rivalling his father also, in 
other respects, he restrained, by edict,* the exactions of the 
courtiers, thefts, rapine, and the violation of women ; com- 
manding the delinquents to be deprived of sight, as well as 
of their manhood. He also displayed singular diligence 
against the mintmasters, commonly cialled moneyers ; sufier^ 
ing no counterfeiter, who had been convicted of deluding the 
ignorant by the practice of his roguery, to escape^ without 
losing his hand. 

Adopting the custom of his brother, he soothed the Scot- 
tish kings by his affability. For William made Duncan, the 
illegitimate son of Malcolm, a knight ; and, on the death of 
his father, appointed him king of Scotland. When Duncan 
was taken off by the wickedness of his uncle Donald, he 
promoted Edgar to the kingdom ; the abovementioned Donald 
being despatched by the contrivance of David, the youngest 
brother, and the power of William. Edgar yielding to fate, 
Henry made affinity with Alexander, his successor, giving 
him his illegitimate daughter in marriage, by whom be had 
no issue that I know of ; and when she died, he did not much 
lament her loss : for there was, as they affirm, some defect 
about the lady, either in correctness of manners, or elegance 
of person. Alexander resting with his ancestors, David the 
youngest of Malcolm's sons, whom the king had made a knight 
and honoured with the marriage of a woman of quality, 
ascended the throne of Scotland. A youth more courtlj than 
the rest, and who, polished, from a boy, by interconrae and

familiarit3r with uSy had mbbed off all the rust of Scottish bar- 
bflrism. Finallj, when he obtained the kingdom, he released 
firom the payment of taxes, for three 7eai*8, all such of his 
conntrymen as would pay more attention to their dwellings, 
dress more elegantly, and feed more nicely. No history has 
ever recorded three kings, and at the same time brothers, 
who were of equal sanctity, or savoured so much of their 
mother^s piety ; for independently of their abstemiousness, 
their extensive charity, and their frequency in prayer, they 
so completely subdued the domestic vice of kings, that no 
report, even, prevailed, that any entered their bed except 
their legitimate wives, or that either of them had ever been 
guilty of any unlawful intercourse. Edmund was the only 
d^enerate son of Margaret, who, partaking in his uncle 
Donald's crime, and bargaining for half his kingdom, had been 
accessary to his brother's death. But being taken, and 
doomed to perpetual imprisonment, he sincerely repented ; 
and, on his near approach to death, ordered himself to be 
buried in his chains : confessing that he suffered deservedly 
for the crime of fratricide. 

The Wdsh, perpetually rebelling, were subjugated by the 
king in repeated expeditions, who, relying on a prudent ex- 
pedient to quell their tumults, transported thither all the 
Flemings then resident in England. For that country con- 
tained such numbers of these people, who, in the time of his 
father, had come over from national relationship to his 
mother, that, from their numbers, they appeared burdensome 
to the kingdom. In consequence he settied them, with all 
their property and connexions, at Boss, a Welsh province, as 
in a common receptacle^ both for the purpose of cleansing 
the kingdom, and repressing the brutal temerity of the 
enemy. Still, however, he did not neglect leading his expe^ 
ditions thither, as circumstances required : in one of which, 
being privily aimed at with an arrow from a distance, though 
by whose audacity is unknown, he opportunely and fortun- 
ately escaped, by the interposition of his firmly mailed 
hauberk, and the counsel of God at the same time frustrating 
this treachery. But neither was the director of the arrow 
discovered at that time, nor could he ever after be detected, 
although the king immediately declared, that it was not let 
fly by a Welshman, but by a subject ; swearing to it, by the

death of oar Lofd, which was hb eastomazy oatli when 
moved, either by excess of anger or the importance of the 
occasion. For at that very lime the army was nuuching 
cantionsly and slowly upon its own ground, not in an ene- 
my's territory, and therefore nothing less was to be expected 
than an hostile attack. Bat, nevertheless^ he desisted not 
from his purpose through fear of intestine danger, nntil the 
Webh appeased the commotion of the royal spirit, by giving 
the sons of their nobility as hostages, together with some 
money, and much of their substance. 

By dint of gold, too, he brought the inhabitants of Brittany 
to his views, whom, when a young man, he had had as 
neighbours to his castles of Dan£runt and Mount St. Mi- 
chaers ; for these are a race of people, poor at home, aad 
seeking abroad to support a toilsome life by foreign service. 
Beardless of right and of affinity, they decline not evoi 
civil war, provided they are paid for it ; and, in proportion 
to the remimeration, are ready to enter any service that maj 
be offered. Aware of this custom, if, at any time he had 
need of stipendiary troops, he used to lavish money on these 
Bretons ; thereby hiring the faith of a faithless nation. 

In the beginning of his reign he offended Kobert, earl of 
Flanders, from the following cause : BaldMrin the Elder, the 
grandfather of this Robert, had powerfully assisted Wi^am, 
when going to England, by the wisdom of his councils, for 
which he was famed, and by a supply of soldiers. William 
had frequently made Splendid returns for this ; giving, every 
year, as they report^ three hundred marks* of silver to his 
father-in-law, on account of his fidelity and affini^^. Tins 
mnnificence was not diminished towards his son Baldwin; 
though it was dropped through the evil disposition of Robert 
Friso, as my history hAs already recorded. Moreover this 
Bobert, the son of fViso, easily obtained the omitted largess 
from WiUiam the Second, because the one alleged his rela- 
tionship, and the other possessed a boundless spirit in squan- 
dering money. But Henry giving the business deeper 
consideration, as a man who nev^ desired to obtain money

knights.''— HAEDr.

improperly, nor erer wantonly exhausted it when aoquired, 
gave the following reply to Robert, on his return from Jeru- 
salem, when imperiously making a demand, as it were, of 
three hundred marks of silver. He said, " that the kings of 
Enghmd were not accustomed to pay tribute to the Flemings ; 
and that he would not tarnish the liberty of his ancestors by 
the stain of his cowardice ; therefore, if he would trust to his 
generosity, he would willingly give him, as a kinsman and as 
a friend, whatever circumstances would permit ; but if he 
thought proper to persist in his demand, he should refuse it 
ahogether." Confuted by this reasoning, he, for a long time, 
cherished his indignation against Henry; but getting little 
or nothing by his enmity, he bent his mind to milder mea- 
sures; having discovered that the king might be wrought 
upon by intreaty, but not by imperious insolence. But now, 
the change of times had given his son, Baldwin, matter of 
ofience against Henry ; for, wishing to place William, * the 
son of Robert the Norman, in his inheritance^ he voluntarily 
busied himself in the affairs of others, and frequently made 
unexpected attacks upon the king's castles in Normandy. 
He threatened extreme trouble to the country, had the fates 
permitted; but engaging at Arques with a larger party of 
soldiers than he had apprehended, he accelerated his death ; 
for his helmet being battered with repeated strokes, he 
received an injury in his brain. They relate, that his dis- 
order was increased from having that day eaten garlic with 
goose, and that he did not even abstain from carnal inter- 
course at night. Here let posterity contemplate a noble 
specimen of royal attention ; for the lung sent a most skilful 
physician to the patient, bewailing, as we may believe, that 
person's perishing by (Hsease, whom, through admiration of 
his valour, he had rather seen survive. Charles, his suc- 
cessor, never annoyed the king ; and first, with a doubtful, 
but afterwards, a formal treaty, embraced his friendship. 

Philip, king of France, was neither friendly nor hostile to 
our king, being more intent on gluttony than business; 
neither were his dominions situated in the vicinity of Hen- 
ry's castles ; for the few which he possessed at that time in

438 WILLIAM OF KALKBSBUST. 

Normandy were nearer to Brittany than France, 
as I have said before, Philip growing in years was oppressed 
by lust ; and, allored by the beauty of the countess of Anjou, 
was enslaved to illicit passion for her. In consequence of 
his being excommunicated by the pope^ no divine service 
could be celebrated in the town where he resided; but on 
his departure the chiming of the bells resounded on all sides, 
at which he expressed his stupid folly by laughter, saying, 
" You hear, my fair, how they drive us away."* He was 
held in such contempt by all the bishops of his kingdom, 
that no one, except William,f archbishop of Rouen, would 
marry them : the rashness of which deed he atoned for by 
being many years interdicted, and was with difficulty, at 
last, restored to apostolical communion by archbishop An- 
selm. In the mean while, no space of time could give satiety 
to Philip's mad excess, except that, in his last days, bdng 
seized with sickness, he took the monastic habit at Flory.^ 
She acted with better grace and better success; as she 
sought the veil of a nun at Fontevrault, while yet possessed 
of strength and health, and undiminished beauty. Soon 
after she bade adieu to the present life : God, perhaps, fore- 
seeing that the frame of a delicate woman could not endure 
the austerities of a monastery. 

Lewis, the son of Philip, was very changeable ; firmly 
attached to neither party. At first, extremely indignant 
against Robert, he instigated Henry to seize Normandy ; 
seduced by what had been plundered from the English, and 
the vast wealth of the lang. Not indeed, that the one 
offered it, but the other invited him ; exhorting him, of hist 
own accord, not to suffer the nerves of that once most 
fiourishiug country, to be crippled by his forbearance. But 
an enmity afterwards arose between them, on account of 
Theobald, earl of Blois, son of Stephen who fell at Ramula ; 

* He probably intended a joke on the custom of ringing the bdls to 
acaie evil spirits.

design into effect.**— Hardt.

Theobald being the son of St^hen bj Adala, daughter of 
William the Great For a considerable time, messengers on 
the part of the king wasted their labour, entreating that 
Lewis would condescend to satisfj Theobald. But he^ 
paying little regard to entreaties, caused Theobald to be 
excommunicated by the pope, as arrogant and a rebel to 
God ; who, in addition to the austerity of his manners, 
which seemed intolerable to all, was represented as depriving 
his lord of his hereditary possessions. Their quarrel being 
thus of long continuance^ when, each swollen with pride, 
neither would vail his consequence to the other, Lewis 
entered Normandy, proudly devastating every thing with 
overbearing violence. These things were reported to the 
king, who shut himself up in Rouen until the common 
fioldiers infested his ears, by saying, "That he ought to 
allow Lewis to be driven back ; a man who formerly kept 
liis bed through corpulency, but was now, by Henry's 
forbearance, loading the very air with threats." The king, 
mindful of his father's example, rather preferred crushing 
the folly of the Frenchman by endurance, than repelling it 
t>y force. Moreover, he kindly soothed his soldiers, by 
addressing them to the following effect, *^ That they ought 
not to wonder if he avoided lavishing the blood of those 
whom he had proved to be faithful by repeated trials : that 
it would be impious, in achieving power to himself, to glory 
in the deaths of those persons who jiad devoted their lives to 
-voluntary conflicts for his safety ; that they were the adopted 
of his kingdom, the foster-children of his affection ; where- 
fore he was anxious to follow the example of a good king, 
and by his own moderation to check the impetuosity of those 
ivhom he saw so ready to die for hiuL** At last, when he 
beheld his forbearance wrongly interpreted, and denominated 
cowardice, insomuch that Lewis burnt and plundered within 
four miles of Rouen ; he called up the powers of his soul 
with greater effort, and, arraying his troops, gloriously 
conquered : compensating his past forbearance by a san- 
guinary victory. But, however, soon afterwards, peace was 
concluded, "Because there is a change in all things, and 
money, which is capable, of persuading what it lists, 
extenuates every injury.** In consequence William, the son 
of our king, did homage to the king of France for Normandy,

folding that province, in fatorey hj legal riglit fipom him. 
This was the period when the same youth married the 
daughter of Fulco, earl of Anjou, and obtained, hj the 
careful management of his father, that, thxx>ugh the 
mediation of money and of affinity, no tumulta should 
affect the son. 

At this time, pope Caliztus,* of whom I shall relate mach 
hereafter, approached the confines of Normandy, where the 
king of England, entering into conference with him, com- 
pelled the Romans to admire and prockdm the ingenuity of 
the Normans. For he had come^ as was reported, iU-dispoeed 
towards Henry ; intending sererely to expostulate with him, 
for keeping lus brother, the pilgrim of the Holy Sepulchre^ 
in confinement. But beipg pressed by the king's answer, 
which was specious, and by his plausible arguments^ he had 
Uttle to reply. For eren common topics may avail, through 
eloquence of speech ; and, more especially, that oratory 
cannot be despised, which is seasoned with valuable presents. 
And that nothing might be wanting to the aggregate of 
glory, he provided some youths of noble family, the sons 
of the earl of MeUent, to dispute with the cardinals in logic. 
To whose inextricable sophLsms, when, from the liveliness of 
their arguments, they could make no resistance, the cardinals 
were not ashamed to confess, that the Western climes 
flourished with greater literary eminence, than they had ever 
heard of^ or imagined, while yet in their own oountry. 
Wherefore, the issue of this conference, was, that the pope 
declared, that nothing could be more just than the king of 
England's cause ; nothing more conspicuous than his pru- 
dence, or more copious than his eloquence. 

The father of these youths was Robert, earl of MeUent, as 
I observed, the son of Roger de Beaumont, who built the 
monastery of Freaux in Normandy; a man of primitive 
simplicity and sincerity, who, being frequently invited by 
WiUiam the First, to come to England, and receive, as a 
recompence, whatever possessions he chose, always declined ; 
saying, that he wished to cultivate the inheritance of his 
forefathers, rather than covet or invade foreign possessions 
which did not belong to him. He had two sons, Robert, of

TV'liom we are speaking, and Henry. Henrj earl of Warwick, 
a man of sweet and placid disposition, passed and ended his 
days, in occupations congenial to his habits. The other, 
more shrewd, and of a subtler character, in addition to his 
paternal inheritance in Normandj and large estates in 
England, purchased from the king of France a castle called 
Mellent, which Hugh the son of Gualeraun, his mother's 
brother, had held. Conducted gradually by budding hope 
towards fame in the time of the former kings, he attained to 
its full bloom in Henry's days ; and his advice was regarded 
as though the oracle of God had been consulted : indeed he 
was deservedly esteemed to have obtained it, as he was of 
ripe age to counsel ; the persuader of peace, the dissuader of 
strife, and capable of very speedily bringing about whatever 
he desired, from the powers of his eloquence. He possessed 
such mighty influence in England, as to change by his single 
example the long established modes of dress and of diet. 
Finally, the custom of one meal a day, is observed * in the 
palaces of all the nobilily through his means ; which he, 
adopting from Alexius, emperor of Constantinople, on the 
score of his health, spread, as I have observed, among the 
rest by his authority. He is blamed, as having done, and taught 
others to do this, more through want of liberaHly, than any 
fear of surfeit, or indigestion ; but undeservedly : since no 
one, it is said, was more lavish in entertainments to others, 
or more moderate in himself. In law, he was the supporter 
of justice ; in war, the insurer of victory : urging lus lord 
the king to enforce the rigour of the statutes ; himself not 
only following the existing, but proposing new ones : free 
liimself from treachery towards the king, he was the avenger 
of it in others, t 

Besides this personage king Henry had among his counsel- 
lors, Roger t bbhop of Salisbury, on whose advice he prin-

cipallj relied. For, before his accession, he had made him 
regulator of his household, and on becoming king, having 
had proof of his abilities, appointed him first GhanceUor and 
then a bishop. The able discharge of his episcopal functions 
led to a hope that he might be deserving of a higher office. 
He therefore committed to his care the administration of the 
whole kingdom, whether he might be himself reddcuit in 
England or absent in Normandy. The bishop refused to 
embroil himself in cares of such magnitude, until the three 
archbishops of Canterbury, Anselm, Halph, William, and 
lastly the pope, ezyoined him the duty of obedience. Henry 
was extremely eager to effect this, aware that Roger would 
faithfully perform every thing £or his advantage. Nor did 
he deceive the royal expectation ; but conducted himself vnih 
so much integrity and diligence, that not a spark of envy 
was kindled against him. Moreover, the king was frequently 
detained in Normandy, sometimes for three, sometimes foor 
years, and sometimes for a longer period ; and on his return 
to his kingdom, he gave credit to the chancellor's discretion 
for finding little or nothing to distress him. Amid all these 
affiurs, he did not neglect his ecclesiastical duties, but daily 
diligently transacted them in the morning, that he might be 
more ready and undisturbed for other business. He was a 
prelate of a great mind, and spared no expense towards com- 
pleting his designs, especially in buildings, which niay be 
seen in other places, but more particularly at Salisbury and 
at Mahnesbury. For there he erected extensive edifices, at 
vast cost, and with surpassing beauty ; the courses of stone 
being so correctly laid that the joint deceives the eye, and 
leads it to imagine that the whole wall is composed of a 
single block. He built anew the church of Salisbury, and 
beautified it in such a manner that it yields to none in Eng- 
land, but surpasses many, so that he had just cause to say,

entered in, and requested the priest to saj mass. Roger began immedi-

sion." And when the royal youth said, *' Follov me,** he adhered «s 
closely to him, as Peter did to his heavenly Lord uttering a similar com- 
mand ; for Peter, leaving his vessel, followed the King of kings ; he, leav- 
ing his church, followed the prince, and appointed chaplain to himaelf and 
his troops, became « a blind guide to the blmd." Vide G. Neubrig, 1. 6.

Murcard, king of Ireland, and his successors, whose names 
have not reached our notice, were so devotedly attached to 
our Henry that they wrote no letters but what tended to 
soothe him, and did nothing but what he commanded ; 
although it maj be observed that Murcard, from some un- 
known cause, acted, for a short time, rather superciliously 
towards the English; but soon after on the suspension of 
navigation and of foreign trade, his insolence subsided. 
For of what value could Ireland be if deprived of the mer- 
chandize of England? From poverty, or rather from the 
ignorance of the cultivators, the soil, unproductive of every 
good, engenders, without the cities, a rustic, filthy swarm of 
natives ; but the English and French inhabit the cities in a 
greater degree of civilization through their mercantile traffic 
Paul, earl of Orkney, though subject by hereditary right to 
the king of Norway, was so anxious to obtain the king's 
friendship, that he was perpetually sending him presents; 
for he was extremely fond of the wonders of distant coun- 
tries, begging with great delight, as I have observed, from 
foreign kings, lions, leopards, lynxes, or cameb, — animals 
which England does not produce. He had a park called 
Woodstock, in which he used to foster his favourites of 
this kind. He had placed there also a creature called a 
porcupine, sent to him by William of Montpelier ; of which 
animal, Pliny the Elder, in the eighth book of his Natural 
History, and Isodorus, on Etymologies, relate that there is 
such a creature in Africa, which the inhabitants call of the 
urchin kind, covered with bristly hairs, which it naturally 
darts against the dogs when pursuing it : moreover, these are, 
as I have seen, more than a span long, sharp at each extremity, 
like the quills of a goose where the feather ceases, but 
rather thicker, and speckled, as it were, with black and 
white. 

What more particularly distinguished Henry was that 
though frequently and long absent from his kingdom on ac- 
count of the commotions in Normandy, yet he so restrained 
the rebellious, by the terror of his name, that peace remained 
undbturbed in England. In consequence, foreigners will- 
ingly resorted thither, as to the only haven of secure tran- 
quillity. Finally, Siward king of Norway, in his early years 
comparable to the bravest heroes, having entered on a voyage

to Jerusalem, and asking the king's permission, wintered in 
England. Aflter expending rast sums upon the churches^ as 
soon as the western breeaie opened the gates of spring to 
soothe the ocean, he regained his vessels, and proceeding to 
sea, terrified the Balearic Isles, which are called Miyorca 
and Minorca, by his arms, leaving them an easier conquest 
to the before-mentioned William of MontpeHer. He thenoe 
proceeded to Jerusalem with all his ships in safety except 
one; she, while delaying to loose her cable from shore, was 
sucked into a tremendous whirlpool, which Paul* the histo- 
rian of Lombardy describes as lying between the coasts of 
the Seine and Aquitaine, with such a force of water that its 
dashing may be heard at thirty miles' distance. Arriving at 
Jerusalem he, for the advancement of the Christian caoae^ 
laid siege to, battered, and subdued the maritime cities 
of Tyre and Sidon. Changing his route, and entering Con* 
stantinople, he fixed a ship, beaked with golden dragons, as 
a trophy, on the church of Sancta Sophia. His men dying 
in numbers in this city, he discovered a remedy for the dis- 
order, by making the survivors drink wine more sparingly, 
and ^uted with water ; and this with singular sagacity ; for 
pouring wine on the liver of a hog, and finding that it pre- 
sently dissolved by the acridity of the liquor, he immediately 
coi^ectured that the same effect took place in men, and after- 
wards dissecting a dead body, he had ocular proof of it 
Wherefore the emperor contemplating his sagacity and cou- 
rage, which promised something great, was inclined to 
detain him* But he adroitly dduded the expectation in 
which he was already devouring the Norwegian gold ; for, 
obtaining pennission to go to a neighbouring dty, he de- 
posited witii him the chests of his treasures, filled with lead 
and sealed up, as pledges of a very speedy return ; by which 
contrivance the emperor was deceived, and the other retained 
home by land. 

But my narrative must now return to Henry. He was

active in providing what would be beneficial to bis empire ;^ 
finn in defending it ; abstinent from war, as far as he could 
with honour ; but when he had determined no longer to for- 
bear, a most severe requiter of injuries, dissipating eveiy 
opposing danger by the energy of his courage ; constant in 
enmity or in affection towards all ; giving too much indulg- 
ence to the tide of anger in the one, gratif^g his royal 
magnanimity in the other; depressing his enemies indeed 
even to despair, and exalting his friends and dependants to 
an enviable condition. For philosophy propounds this to be 
the first or greatest concern of a good king, 

^ To spare the suppliant, but depress the proud."t 

Inflexible in the adnunistration of justice, he ruled the 
people with moderation; the nobility with condescension. 
Seeking after robbers and counterfeiters with the greatest 
diligence, and punishing them when discovered ; neither was 
he by any means negligent in matters of lesser importance. 
When he heard that the tradesmen refused broken money, { 
though of good silver, he commanded the whole of it to be 
broken, or cut in pieces. The measure of his own arm was 
applied to correct the false ell of the traders, and enjoined on 
oil throughout England. He made a regulation for the fol- 
lowers of his court, at whichever of his possessions he might 
be resident, stating what they should accept without pay- 
ment from the country-folks; ftnd how much, and at what 
price, they should purchase ; punishing the transgressors by 
a heavy pecuniary fine, or loss of life. In the beginning of

of the times, one of which was the bushyness of men's beards which resem- 
bled Saracens' rather than Christians', and which he supposes tiiey would 
not clip lest the stumps should prick their mistresses' fiices ; another was 
their long locks. Hemy immediately, to show hk submission and repent- 
ance, submits his bushy honours to toe bishop, who, taking a pair of shears 
from his trunk, trims his majesty and several of the principal nobility with

account of its being broken money. — Vide Edmerum Hi^ Novor. p. 94.

If at anj time the better sort, r^ardless of their plighted 
oath, wandered from the path of fidelity, he immediateij 
recalled them to the straight road by tiie wisdom of his 
plans, and his unceasing exertions; bringing back the re- 
firactory to soundness of mind by the wounds he inflicted on 
their bodies. Nor can I easily describe what perpetual 
labour he employed on such persons, while suffering nothing 
to go unpunished which the delinquents had committed 
repugnant to his dignity. Normandy, as I have said before, 
was the chief source of his wars, in which, though princi- 
pally resident^ yet he took especial care for England ; none 
daring to rebel, from the consideration of his courage and of 
his prudence. Nor, indeed, was he erer singled out for the 
attack of treachery, by reason of the rebellion of any of his 
nobles, through means of his attendants, except once; the 
author of which was a certain chamberlain, bom of a ple- 
beian father, but of distinguished consequence, as b^ng 
keeper of the king's treasures ; but, detected, and readily 
confessing his crime, he paid the severe penalty of his per- 
fidy.* With this exception, secure during his whole life, 
the minds of all were restrained by fear, their conversa&o 
by r^ard for him. 

He was of middle stature, exceeding the diminutive, bat 
exceeded by the very tall: his hair was black, but scanty 
near the forehead ; his eyes mildly bright ; his chest brawny ; 
his body fleshy : he was facetious in proper season, nor &d 
multiplicity of business cause him to be less pleasant when 
he mixed in society. Not prone to personal combat, he veri- 
fied the saying of Scipio Africanus, ** My mother bore me a

wisdom to no king of modem time; and, as I maj almoet 
say, he dearlj sorpassed all Lis predeoessors in England, and 
preferred contending hj counad, rather than by tiie sword. 
If he could, he conquered without bloodshed ; if it was una- 
voidable, with as little as possible. He was free, during his 
whole life^ from impure desires;* for, as we have learned 
from those who were well informed, he was led by female 
blandishments, not for the gratification of incontinencj, but 
for the sake of issue ; nor condescended to casual intercourse^ 
unless where it might produce that effect ; in this respect the 
master of his natural inclinations, not the passive slave of 
lust. He was plain in his diet, rather satisfying the calls of 
hunger, than surfeiting himself hj variety of delicacies. He 
never drank but to allay thirst ; execrating the least depar- 
ture firom temperance, both in himself and in those about 
him. He was heavy to sleep, which was interrupted by fre- 
quent snoring. His eloquence was rather unpremeditated 
than laboured ; not rapid, but deliberate. 

His piety towards God was laudable, for he built monaste- 
ries in England and in Normandy : but as he has not yet 
completed them, I, in the meantime, should suspend my 
judgment, did not my affection for the brotherhood at Read- 
ing forbid my silence. He built this monastery between the 
rivers Kennet and Thames, in a place calculated for the re- 
ception of almost all who might have occasion to travel to 
the more populous cities of England, where he placed monks 
of the Clugniac order, who are at this day a noble pattern 
of holiness, and an example of unwearied and delightful 
hospitality. Here may be seen what is peculiar to this place : 
for guests arriving every hour, consume more than ike in- 
mates themselves. Perhaps, some person may call me over- 
Lasty and a flatterer, for so signally celebrating a congrega- 
tion yet in its infancy ; unconscious what future times may 
produce : but they, as I hope, will endeavour, by the grace 
of God, to continue in virtue ; and I blush not at commend- 
ing men of holiness, and admiring that excellence in others 
which I possess not myself. He yielded up the investituref

letters of the so-often-mentioned pope Paschal on the sulject 
** Paschal the bishop to king Henrj, health. From your 
<^^ letters, lately transmitted to us by your servant^ our beloved 
I ^y ^^ William the derk, we have been certified both of the 
M /^ safety of your person, and of those prosperous successes which 
the divine favour hath granted you in the subjugation of the 
adversaries of your kingdom. We have heard too, that yon 
have had the male issue you so much desired, by your noble 
and religious consort. As we have derived pleasure from 
this, we think it a good opportunity to impress tiie commands 
and will of Grod more strongly upon you, at a time when you 
perceive yourself indebted to lus kindness for such ample 
favours. We also are desirous of associating out kindness 
with the benefits of God towards you ; but it is distressing, 
that you should seem to require what we cannot possibly 
grant For if we consent, or suffer, that investitures be con- 
ferred by your excellence, no doubt it will be to the great 
detriment both of ourselves, and of you. In this matter we 
wish yott' to consider, what you lose by not perfomung, or 
gain by performing. For we, by such a pn}|dbition, obtain 
no inct'ease of influence, or patronage, over the churches ; 
nor do we endeavour to take away any thing from your just 
power and right ; but only that God's anger may be dimi- 
nished towards you, and thus every prosperity attend yiou.

their appointment also. Tne popes at length finding how much sach a 
practice tended to render the clergy dependent on the temporal power, in- 
nibited th^ receiving investiture from Ujmen by the staff and ling, which 
were emblems of their spiritual office. The compronuse of Henry with 
Paschal enacted, that in future the king would not confer bishopiics by the

You will saj then, * It is mj right ;' no truly, it is neither 
an imperial nor royal, but a divine right ; it is His only, who 
has said, ' I am the door :' wherefore I entreat for his sake^ 
whose due it is, that you would restore and concede it to 
him, to whose love you owe what you possess. But why 
should we oppose your pleasure, or run counter to your good 
will, unless we were aware, that in consenting to this matter, 
we should oppose the will of God, and lose his favour ? Why 
should we deny you any thing, which might be granted to 
any man living, when we should receive greater favours in 
return ? Consider, my dearest son, whether it be an honour, 
or a disgrace that Anselm, the wisest^ and most religious of 
the Gfdiican bishops, on this accounl^ fears to be familiar 
with you, or to continue in your kingdom. What will those 
persons think, who have hitherto had such favourable ac- 
counts of you ? What will they say, when this gets noised 
abroad ? The very people who, before your face, commend 
your excess, will, when out of your presence, be the first 
TDOce loudly to vilify the transaction. Return then to your 
understanding, my dearest son, we entreat you, for the mercy 
of God, and the love of his Only-begotten Son : recall your 
pastor, recall your father ; and if, what we do not imagine, 
he hath in anything conducted himself harshly towards you, 
and hath opposed the investitures, we will mediate accord- 
ing to your pleasure, as far as Gt)d permits : but neverthe- 
less, remove from your person and your kingdom the infamy 
of such an expulsion. If you do this, even although you 
should ask very difficult matters of us ; still if, with God's 
permission, we can grant, you shall certainly obtain, them : 
and we will be careful to entreat the Lord for you, himself 
assisting, and will grant indulgence and absolution, as well 
to your sins, as to those of your consort, through the merits 
of the holy apostles. Moreover, we will, together with you, 
cherish the son whom you have begotten on your exemplary 
and noble consort ; and who is, as we have heard, named 
after your excellent father, William, with such anxious care, 
that whosoever shall injure either you, or him, shall be 
regarded as having done injury to the church of Rome.

charity. In these we recognise the fervency of your devo- 
tion, and considering the strength of your £uth, and the 
earnestness of your pious care, we rejoice ; because, by the 
grace of Grod, neither promises elevate, nor threats depress 
^>^ • you. We lament, however, that after having kindly received 
£j 1^ our brother bishops, the ambassadors of the king of England, 
they should, on their return home, report what we never 
uttered, or even thought of. For, we have heard, that they 
said, if the king conducted himself well in other respects, we 
should neither prohibit the investiture of the churches, nor 
anathematize them, when conferred ; but that we were un- 
willing thus to write, lest from this precedent other princes 
should exclaim. Wlierefore we call Jesus, who trieth the 
hearts and reins, as witness to our soul, if ever such a horrid 
crime, even entered our imagination, since we assumed the 
care of this holy see.** And again below. '* If, therefore, 
a lay hand present the staff, the sign of the shepherd's office, 
or the ring, the emblem of faith, what have the bishops to do 
in the church ? Moreover, those bishops who have changed 
the truth into a lie, that truth, which is God, being the crite- 
rion, we separate from the favour of St. Peter and our society, 
until they have made satisfaction to the church of Rome. 
Such, therefore, as have received the investiture,* or conse- 
cration, during the aforesaid truce,f we regard as aliens to 
our communion and to the church." 

'* Paschal to Anselm. Since the condescension of Almighty 
Grod hath inclined the heart of the king of England to obe- 
dience to the papal see, we give thanks to the same Grod of 
mercies, in whose hand are situated the hearts of kings. 
We believe it indeed to have been effected through favour to 
your charity, and the earnestness of your prayers, that in 
this respect the heavenly mercy hath r^arded the people

that all matters should remain in abeyance, until both parties should havw

over whom jour watchfulness presides. But whereas we so 
greatly condescend to the king and those who seem culpable, 
jon must know that this has been done from kindness and 
compassion, that we maj lift up those that are down. And 
jouy also, reverend and dearest brother in Christ, we release 
£x>m the prohibition or, as 70U conceive, excommunica- 
tion, which, you understand, was denounced against investi- 
tures or homage by our predecessor of holy memory pope 
Urban. But do you, by the assistance of Grod, accept those 
persons who either receive investitures, or consecrate such as 
have received them, or do homage on making that satisfaction 
which we signify to you by our common legates William and 
Baldwin, faithful and true men, and absolve them by virtue of 
our authority. These you will either consecrate yourself, or 
oommand to be consecrated by such as you choose ; unless 
perchance you should discover somewhat in them on account 
of which tibey ought to be deprived of their sacre<] honours. 
And if any, hereafter, in addition to the investitures of the 
churches, shall have accepted prelacies, even though they 
have done homage to the king, yet let them not, on this ac- 
count, be denied the office of consecration, until by the grace 
of Almighty Grod, the heart of the king may be softened, by 
the dew of your preaching, to omit this. Moreover, against 
the bishops who have brought, as you know, a false report 
from us, our heart is more vehemently moved, because they 
have not only injured us, but have led astray the minds of 
many simple people, and impelled the king to want of charity 
for the papal see. Wherefore, by the help of God, we suffer 
not their crime to pass unpunished : but since the earnest- 
ness of our son the king unceasingly entreats for them, you 
will not deny, even them, the participation of your commu- 
nion. Indeed, you will, according to our promise, absolve 
from their transgressions and from penance the king and his 
consort, and those nobles who for this business, together with 
the king, have by our command been under sentence, whose 
names you will learn from the information of the aforesaid 
William. We commit the cause of the bishop of Rouen to 
your consideration, and we grant to him whatsoever you 
may allow." 

In this manner acted Paschal the supreme pope, anxious 
for the liberty of the churches of Grod. The bishops whom

he accuses of falsehood, were Girard archbishop of Yoi^ 
and Herbert of Norwich, whose errors were discovered by 
the more veracious legates, Willimn afterwards biahop it 
Exeter, and Baldwin monk of Bee. * Anselm* the arch- 
bishop was now again, in the time of this king, an exile at 
Lyons, resident with Hugh, archbishop of that citj, when 
the first letter which I have inserted was despatched ; for he 
himself possessed no desire to return, nor did th« kiiig, 
through the multitude of sycophants, suffer his animosity to 
be appeased. He deferred, therefore, for a long time, reodl- 
ing him or complying with the papal admonition ; jiot finom 
desire of power, but through the advice of the n(^>ility, and 
particularly of the earl of Mellent, who, in this affidr, runniiig 
counter to reason more from ancient custom than a sense of 
right, alleged that the king's majesty must be much dimi- 
nished if^ disregarding the usage of his predecessorsi he 
ceased to invest the elected person with the staff and ring. 
The king, however, considering more attentively what t£« 
clear reasoning of the epistles, and the bountiful gift of 
divine favours, plentifully showered down upon him, admon- 
ished, yielded up the investiture of the ring and staff for 
ever, retaining only the privilege of election and of the tem- 
poralities. A great council, therefore, of bishops, nobles, 
and abbats, being assembled at London, many points of 
ecclesiastical and secular business were settled, manj differ- 
ences adjusted. And not long after, five bishops were 
ordained in Kent, on the same day, by archbishop Anaelm: 
William to the see of Winchester; Roger to Salisbury; 
William to Exeter; Beinald to Hereford; Urban to Gla- 
morgan. Li this manner a controversy, agitated by per- 
petual dissensions, and the cause of many a journey to and 
from Rome by Anselm, met with a oommendaUe termination. 
Henry^s queen, Matilda, descended firom an ancient and 
illustrious race of kings, daughter of the king of Scotland, 
as I have said before, had also given her attention to litera- 
ture, being educated, from her infancy, among the nuzia at 
Wilton and Romsey. Wherefore, in order to have a colour 
for refusing an ignoble alliance, which was more than <mce 
offered by her father, she wore the garb indicative of the

liolj prafeedoii. This, when the Mog was about to advance 
her to h]8 bed, became matter of controvers j ; nor could the 
archbiflhop be induced to conflent to her nutrriage, but bj 
the iNToduction of lawful witnesses, who swore that she had 
worn the veil on account of her suitors, but had never made 
her vow. Satisfied with a child of either sex, she ceased 
having issue, and enduring with complacency, when the king 
was elSewhere employed, the absence of the court, she con- 
tinued many years at Westminster; yet was no part of royal 
mAgnifioence wanting to her; but at all times crowds of 
visitants and talebearers were, in endless multitudes, entering 
and departing from her superb dwelling ; for this the king's 
liberality oonunanded ; this her own kindness and affability 
attracted. She was singularly holy ; by no means despicable 
in point of beauty; a rival of her mother's piety; never 
committing any impropriety, as far as herself was concerned ; 
and, with the exception of the king's bed, completely chaste 
and uncontaminated even by suspicion. Clad in hair cloth 
beneath her royal haUt, in Lent, she trod the thresholds of 
the churches barefoot. Nor was she disgusted at washing 
the feet of the diseased ; handling their ulcers dripping with 
corruption, and, finally, pressing their hands, for a long time 
together to her lips, and decking their table. She had a 
singular pleasure in hearing the service of God ; and on this 
account was thoughtlessly prodigal towards clerks of melo- 
dious voice ; addressed them kindly, gave to them liberally, 
and promised still more abundantly. Her generosity becom- 
ing universally known, crowds of scholars, equally famed for 
verse and for singing, came over ; and happy did he account 
liimself who could soothe the ears of the queen by the no- 
velty of his song. Nor on these only did she lavish money, 
but on all sorts of men, especially foreigners, that through 
her presents they might proclaim her celebrity abroad ; for 
the desire of fame is so rooted in the human mind, that 
scarcely is any one contented with the precious fruits of a 
good conscience, but is fondly anxious, if he does any thing 
laudable, to have it generally known. Hence, it was justly 
observed, the disposition crept upon the queen to reward all 
the foreigners she could, while the others were kept in sus- 
pense, sometimes with effectual, but oftener with empty pro- 
mises. Hence, too, it arose that she fell into the error of

prodigal givers ; bringing many claims on her tenantry, ex- 
posing them to injuries, and taking away their property ; by 
which obtaining the credit of a liberal benefactress, she fittle '' 
regarded their sarcasms. But whoso shall judge rightly, 
will impute this to the designs of her servants, who, harpy- 
like, conveyed everything they could gripe into their pors^ 
or wasted it in riotous living. Her ears being infected with 
the base insinuations of these people, she induced tfaSs stain 
on her noble mind, holy and meritorious in every other re- 
spect. Amid these concerns she was snatched away from 
her country, to the great loss of the people, but to her own 
advantage; for her funeral being splendidly celebrated at 
Westminster, she entered into rest; and her spirit mani- 
fested, by no trivial indications, that she was a resident in 
heaven. She died, willingly leaving the throne, after a 
reign of seventeen years and six months, experiencing the 
fate of her family, who almost all departed in the flower of 
their age. To her, but not immediately, succeeded Adala,* 
daughter of the duke of Louvain, which is the princi|^ 
town of Lorraine. 

By Matilda king Henry had a son named William, educa- 
ted and destined to the succession,! with the fondest hope, 
and surpassing care. For to him, when scarcely twelve 
years* of age, all the free men of England and Normandy, 
of every rank and condition, and under fealty to whatever 
lord, were obliged to submit themselves by homage, and by 
oath. When a boy, too, he was betrothed to and received 
in wedlock, the daughter of Fulcoj: earl of Anjou, who was 
herself scarcely marriageable ; his father-in-law bestowing 
on him the county of Maine as her dower. Moreover, 
Fulco, proceeding , to Jerusalem, committed his earldom to 
the king, to be restored, should he return, but otherwise^

to go to his son-in-law. Many provinces, then, looked for- 
ward to the goyemment of this hoy: for it was supposed 
that the prediction of king Edward would he verified in 
him ; and it was said, that now might it he expected, that 
the hopes of England, like the tree* cut down, would, 
through this youth, again hlossom and hring forth fruit, 
and thus put an end to her sufferings : hut Gkid saw other- 
wise; Tor this illusion vanished into air, as an early day 
was hastening him to his fate. Indeed, hy the exertions 
of his father-in-law, and of Theohald the son of Stephen, 
and of his aunt Adala, Lewis king of France conceded the 
legal possession of Normandy to the lad, on his doing him 
homage. The prudence of his truly careful father so ar- 
ranged and contrived, that the homage, which he, from the 
extent of his empire, disdained to perform, should not he 
refused hy his son, a youth of delicate hahit, and not very 
likely to live. In discussing and peaceahly settling these 
matters, the king spent the space of four years ; continuing 
the whole of that time in Normandy. Nevertheless, the 
calm of this hrilliant, and carefully concerted peace, this 
anxious, universal hope, was destroyed in an instant by the 
vicissitudes of human estate. For, giving orders for re- 
turning to England, the king set sail from Barfleur just 
before twilight on the seventh before the kalends of De- 
cember ; and the breeze which filled his sails conducted him 
safely to his kingdom and extensive fortunes. But the 
young man, who was now somewhat more than seventeen 
years of age, and, by his father's indulgence, possessed 
everything but the name of king, commanded another ves- 
sel to be prepared for himself ; almost all the young nobility 
flocking around him, from similarity of youthful pursuits. 
The sailors, too, immoderately fiUed with wine, with that 
seaman's hilarity which their cups excited, exclaimed, that 
those who were now a-head must soon be left astern; for 
the ship was of the best construction, and recently fitted 
with new materials. When, therefore, it was now dark 
night, these imprudent youths, overwhelmed with liquor, 
launched the vessel from the shore. She flies swifter than 
the winged arrow, sweeping the rippling surface of the deep : 
but the carelessness of the intoxicated crew drove her on a

rock, which rose aboye the waves not far from shore. In 
the greatest consteniation, they immediatelj ran on de^ 
and with loud outcry got ready their boat*hooks, endea^ 
Youring, for a considerable time, to force the vessel off: 
but fortune resisted and frustrated every exertion. The 
oars, too, dashing, horribly crashed against the rock,* and 
her battered prow hung immoveably fixed. Now, too^ the 
water washed some of the crew overboard, and, entering 
the chinks, drowned others; when the boat having been 
launched, the young prince was rec^ved into it, and might 
certainly have been saved by reaching the shore, had no4 
his illegitimate sister, the countess of Perche^ now strug- 
gling with death in the larger vessel, implored her brother^s 
assistance ; shrieking out that he should not abandon her so 
barbarously. Touched with pity, he ordered the boat to 
return to the ship, that he might rescue his sister ; and thus 
the unhappy youth met his death through excess of affeo- 
tion : for the skiff, overcharged by the multitudes who lei4>ed 
into her, sank, and buried all indiscriminately in the deep. 
One rustic f alone escaped; who, floating all night upon the 
mast, related in the morning, the dismal catastrophe of this 
tragedy. No ship was ever productive of so much misery 
to England ; none ever so widely celebrated throughout the 
world. Here also perished with William, Richard, another 
of the king's sons, whom a woman of no rank had borne 
him, before his accession ; a youth of intrepidity, and dear 
to his father from his obedience: Richard eari of Chester, 
and his brother Otuell, the tutor and preceptor of the king's 
son: the countess of Perche, the king's daughter, and his 
niece the countess of Chester, sister to Theobald: and 
indeed almost every person of consequence about court, 
whether knight, or chaplain, or young nobleoian, training 
up to arms. For, as I have said, they eageriy hastened 
from all quarters, expecting no small addition to their re- 
putation, if they could either amuse, or show their devotion 
to the young prince. The calamity was augmented by the 
difficulty of finding the bodies, which could not be dis- 
covered by the various persons who sought them along the

shore ; Imt delicate as they were, thej became food for the 
monsters of the deep. The death of this youth being known, 
produced a wonderful change in existing circumstances. His 
father renounced the celibacy he had cherished since Matilda's 
death, anxious for future heirs by a new consort : his father- 
in-law, returning home from Jerusalem, faithfully espoused 
the pflfty of William, the son of Robert earl of Normandy, 
giving him his other daughter* in marriage, and the county 
of Maine ; his indignation being excited against the king, by 
his daughtei^s dowry being detained in England after the 
death of the prince. 

His daughter Matilda, by Matilda, king Henry gave in 
marriage to Henry emperor of Grermany,f son of that Henry 
mentioned in the third book. Henry was the fifth emperor 
of the Grermans of this name ; who^ idthough he had been ex- 
tremely incensed at his father for his outrages against the holy 
see, yet, in his own time, was the rigid follower o^ and stick- 
ler for, the same sentiments. For when Paschal, a man pos- 
sessed of every virtue, had succeeded pope Urban, the ques- 
tion again arose concerning the investiture of the churches, 
together with all the former contentions and animosities : as 
neither party would give way. The emperor had in his 
favour fdl the bishops and abbats of his kingdoms situated 
on this side of the mountains ; because Charles the Great, to 
keep in check the ferocity of those nations, had conferred 
almost all the country on the churches: most wisely con- 
sidering, that the clergy would not so soon cast off their 
fidelity to their lord as the laity; and, besides, if the laity 
were to rebel, they might be restrained by the authority of 
their exconmiunication, and the weight of their power. 
The pope had brought over to his side the churches beyond 
the mountains, and the cities of Italy scarcely acknowledged 
the dominion of Henry; thinking themselves exonerated 
from servitude after the death of his brother Conrad, who^ 
being left by his father as king of Lombardy, had died at 
Arezzo. But Henry, rivalling the ancient Caesars in every

noble quality, after tranquillizing his Grerman empire^ ex- 
tended ' his thoughts to Hs Italian kingdom : purposing to 
quell the revolt of the cities, and decide the questiixi of 
investitures, according to his own pleasure. This progress 
to Rome, accomplished bj great exertion of mind, and much 
painful labour of body, hath been described by David, bishop 
of Bangor, a Scot; though far more partially to the king 
than becomes an historian. Indeed he commends highly 
even his unheard-of violence in taking the pope captive, 
though he held him in free custody; citing the example of 
Jacob's holding the angel fast till he extorted a blessing. 
Moreover, he labours to establish, that the saying of the 
apostle, '*No servant of God embroib himself in worldly 
business," is not repugnant to the desires of those bishops, 
who are invested by the laity, because the doing homage to 
a layman, by a clergyman, is not a secular business. How 
frivolous such arguments are, any person's consideration may 
decide. In the meantime, that I may not seem to bear hard 
on a good man by my judgment, I determine to make allow- 
ances for him, since he has not written a history, but a 
panegyric. I will now therefore faithfully insert the grant 
and agreement extorted from the pope, by a forcible deten- 
tion of three weeks; and I shall subjoin, in what manner 
they were soon after made of none effect, by a holier 
council. 

" The sovereign pope Paschal will not molest the sove- 
reign king, nor his empire nor kingdom, on account of the 
investiture of bishoprics and abbeys, nor concerning the in- 
jury suffered by himself and his party in person and in 
goods ; nor will he return evil to him, or any other person, 
on this account ; neither, on any consideration, will he pub- 
lish an anathema against the person of king Henry ; nor will 
the sovereign pope delay to crown him, according to the 
ritual ; and he will assist him, as far as possible, by the aid 
of his office, to retain his kingdom and empire. And this 
the sovereign pope will fulfil without fraud or evil design-" 
These are the names of the bishops and cardinals who, at 
the command of the sovereign pope Paschal, confirmed by 
oath the grant to, and fidendship with, the sovereign em- 
peror Henry: Peter, bishop of Porto; Censius, bishop of 
Sabina; Robert, cardinal of St. Eusebius; Boni&ces, cardinal

Teuzo, cardinal of St. Mark; Theobald, cardinal of John

The king also made oath as follows : " I, Henry, the king, 
"will, on the fourth or fifth day of the ensuing week, set at 
liberty the sovereign pope, and the bishops and cardinals, 
and all the captives and hostages, who were taken for him or 
with him; and I will cause them to be conducted, safely, 
within the gates of the city, beyond the Tiber ;f nor will I 
hereafter seize, or suffer to be seized, such as remain under 
fealty to the lord Paschal : and with the Eoman people, and 
the city beyond the Tiber, I will, as well by myself as by 
my people, preserve peace and security, that is, to such per- 
sons as shall keep peace with me. I will faithfully assist the 
sovereign pope, in retaining his papacy quietly and securely. 
I will restore the patrimony and possessions of the Eoman 
church which I have taken away; and I will aid him in 
recovering and keeping every thing which he ought to have, 
after the manner of his predecessors, with true faith, and 
without fraud or evil design : and I wiU obey the sovereign 
pope, saving the honour of my kingdom and empire, as 
Catholic emperors ought to obey Catholic Eoman pontiffs." 
And they who swore on the part of the king are these: 
Frederic, archbishop of Cologne ; Godebard, bishop of Trent ; 
Bruno, bishop of Spires ; Berengar, earl ; Albert, chancellor ; 
Herman, earl ; Frederic, count palatine ; Boniface, marquis ; 
Albert, earl of Blandriac; Frederic, earl; GrodJ&id, earl;

in which, aftar his own communion, and that of the mini-

to the emperor with these words : ^' This bodj of the Lord,

Mary, exalted on the cross for the redemption of mankind, 
we give to thee, my dearest son, for the remisnon of thy 
sins, and far the preservation of the peace and true friend- 
ship to be confirmed between me and thee, the empire and 
the priesthood.** Again, on the next day, the pope and the 
king met at the columns* which are in the Forum, guards 
being staticmed wherever it was deemed necessary, that the 
consecration of the king might not be impeded. And at the 
Silver f gate he was received by the bishops and cardinals, 
and all tiie Roman clergy ; and the prayer being begun, as 
contained in the ritual, by the bishop of Ostia, as the bif^op 
of Albano^ by whom it ought to have been said, had he been 
present, was absent, he was conducted to the middle of the 
Rota,^ and there received the second prayer from the bishop 
of Porto, as the Roman ritual eigoins. After this they led 
him, with litanies, to the confessionary of the Apostles, § and 
there the bishop of Ostia anointed him between the shoulders 
and on the right arm. This being done he was conducted, 
by the sovereign pontiff to the altar of the aforesaid apostles, 
and there the crown b^g placed on his head by the pope 
himself, he was consecrated emperor. After putting on li» 
crown, the mass of the Resurrection of the Lord was cele- 
brated, in which, before the communion, the sovereign pope, 
with his own hand, gave to the emperor the grant, in whkh 
he conceded to him and his kingdom what is underwritten ; 
and in the same place confirmed it by the sanction of a curse.

since yonr predecessoTS, through valoar and surpassing pru- 
dence^ have obtained the crown and sovereignty of the 
Roman city ; to the dignity of which crown and empire, the 
Divine MiEgesty, by the ministry of our priesthood, hath 
advanced your person, my dearest son Henry. That pre- 
eminence of dignity, then, which our predecessors have 
granted to yours, the Catholic emperors, and have confirmed 
in the volume of grants, we also concede to your affection, 
and in the scroll of this present grant confirm alsoy that you 
may confer the investiture of the staff and ring on the 
bishops or abbats of your kingdom, freely elected, without 
violence or simony: but, after their investiture, let them 
receive canonical consecration from the bishop to whom it 
pertains. But if any person shall be elected, either by the 
clergy or the people, against your consent, unless he be 
invested by you, let him be consecrated by no one ; except- 
ing such, indeed, as are accustomed to be at the disposal of 
the archbishops, or of the Roman pontiff. Moreover, let the 
archbishops or bishops have permission, canonically, to con- 
secrate bishops or abbats invested by you. Your prede- 
cessors, indeed, so largely endowed the churches of their 
kingdom of their royalties, that it is fitting that kingdom 
should be especially strengthened by the power of bishops or 
abbats ; and that popular dissensions, which often happen in 
all elections, should be checked by royal majesty. Where- 
fore, your prudence and authority ought to take more espe- 
cial care to preserve the grandeur of the Roman church, and 
the safety of the rest, through Grod's assistance, by your gifts 
and services. Therefore, if any ecclesiastical or secular 
person, knowing this document of our concession, shall 
rashly dare oppose it, let him be bound with the chain of an 
anathema, unless he recant, and hazard his honour and dig- 
nity. But may Grod's mercy preserve such as keep it, and 
may he grant your person and authority to reign happily to 
his honour and glory." 

The whole ceremony of the consecration being completed, 
the pope and the emperor, joining their right hands, went 
with much state to the chamber which fronts the confession- 
ary of St. Gregory, that the pope might there put off his 
pontifical, and the emperor his regal vestments. As the 
emperor retired from tiie chamber divested of his royal in-

signia, the Roman patricians met him with a golden circle, 
which they placed upon his head, and by it gave him the 
supreme patriciate* of the Roman city, with common con- 
sent and uniyersal approbation. 

All this parade ojf grants and consecration I have taken 
literally from the narratLve of the aforesaid David, written, 
as I said, with too great partiality towards the king. In the 
following year, however, a council was assembled at Rome, 
rather by the connivance than the command of the pope, 
and the grant was nullified. The authors of its reversal, 
were, the archbishop of Yienne, who afterwards ruled the 
papal see ;t and Girard, bishop of Angouleme : who stimu- 
lated their brother bishops, to make these concessions of none 
effect. The proceedings of that council were as follow. 

^' A.D. 1112, the fifth of the indiction, in the thirteenth year 
of the sovereign pope Paschal the second, in the month of 
March, on the fifteenth before the kalends of April, a council 
was held at Rome, at the Lateran, in the churdi of Constan- 
tino 4 where, when pope Paschal, together with the arch- 
bishops, bishops^ and cardinals and a mixed company of deigy 
and laity, had, on the last day of the council, taken his seat ; 
making public profession of the Catholic faith, lest any one 
should doubt his orthodoxy, he said, " I embrace all the Holy 
Scripture of the Old and New Testament ; the Law written 
by Moses, and by the holy prophets : I embrace the four 
Gospels ; the seven canonical Epistles, the Epistles of the 
glorious preacher St Paul, the apostle, the holy canons of 
the apostles ; the four Universal councils, as the four gospels, 
the Nicene, Ephesian, Constantinopolitan, Chalcedonian : 
moreover the council of Antioch and the decrees of the holy 
fathers, the Roman pontiffs ; and more especially the decrees 
of my lords pope Gr^ory the seventh, and pope Urban of 
blessed memory. What they have approved, I approve : 
what they held, I hold : what they have confirmed, I con- 
firm : wlmt they have condemned, I condemn : what they

have opposed, I oppose : what they have interdicted, I inter- 
dict : wliat they have prohibited, I prohibit : I will perse- 
vere in the same in every thing and through every thing.*' 
This being ended, Girard, bishop of Angouleme, legate in 
Aquitaine, rose up for all, and by the unanimous consent of 
pope Paschal and of all the council, read the following 
writing. '* Tliat grant which is no grant, but ought more 
properly to be called an abomination,* for the liberation of 
captives and of the church, extorted from the sovereign pope 
Paschal by the violence of king Henry, the whole of us in 
this holy council assembled, with the sovereign pope, con- 
demn by canonical censure, and ecclesiastical authority, by 
the jud^ent of the Holy Sprit ; and we adjudge it to be 
void, and altogether nullify it : and that it may have neither 
force nor efficacy, we interdict it altogether. And it is con- 
demned, on this account ; because in that abomination it is 
asserted, that a person canonically elected by the clergy and 
the people, shall not be consecrated by any one, unless first 
invested by the king ; which is contrary to the Holy Spirit 
and to canonical institution." This writing being read, the 
whole council, and all present, unanimously cried out Amen, 
Amen : So be it, so be it. 

The archbishops there present with their sufiragans were 
these : John, patriarch of Venice : Semies of Capua : Lan- 
dulf of Benevento : Amalfi, Beggio, Otranto, Brindisi, 
Capsa, Cerenza i\ and the Greeks, Bosanus, and the arch- 
bishop of St. Severina ; the bishops were, Censius of Sabina, 
Peter of Porto, Leo of Ostia, Cono of Prsenesti, Girard of 
Angouleme, Galo of Leon, legate for Berri and the arch- 
bishop of Yienne, Roger of Yolaterra, Gaufrid of Sienna, 
Rolled of Populonia, Gregory of Tarracina, William of 
Turin,} William of Syracuse, legate for all the Sicilians, and 
near a hundred other bishops. Siwin, and John bishop of 
Tusculum, though at Rome, were not present on that day of 
the council ; but they afterwards, on the reading of the con- 
demnation of the grant, assented and approved of it.

of ooDBideiing the emperor as accursed bj the power of 
ecclesiastical zeal hurled against him. Boused at this, in the 
seventeenth* year of pope Paschal, he proceeded to Rome, to 
inflict signal vengeance on him. But he, by a blessed depar- 
ture, f had avoided all earthly molestation, and from his 
place of repose on high, laughed at the threats of the angry 
emperor; who having heard of his death, quickened his 
journey, in order that ejecting John Ghiitan, chancellor to the 
late pope, who had been already elected and called Grelasius, 
he might intrude Maurice,} bishop of Brague, sumamed 
Bourdin, on the See : but the following episde of Gelasius 
will explain the business more fully. 

'^ Gelasius, servant of the servants of God to the arch- 
bishops, bishops, abbats, clergy, princes, and other faithful 
people throughout Graul, health. As you are members of the 
church of Rome, we are anxious to signify to your affecti<»i 
what has there lately taken place. Shortly after our election, 
then, the sovereign emperor coming by stealth and with un- 
expected haste to Rome, compeU^ us to depart the dty. 
He afterwards demanded peace by threats and intimidation, 
saying he would do all he might be able, unless we assured 
him of peace by oath. To which we replied thus : Concern- 
ing the controversy which exists between the church and the 
empire, we willingly agree to a meeting or to legal discussion, 
at proper time and place ; that is to say, either at Milan or 
Cremona, on the next feast of St. Luke, at the discretion of 
our brethren, who, by Grod, are constituted judges in the 
church, and without whom this cause cannot be agitated. 
And since the sovereign emperor demands security from us, 
we promise such to him, by word and by writing, unless in 
the interim himself shall violate it : for otherwise to give 
security is dishonourable to the church, and contrary to 
custom. He, inmiediately, on the forty-fourth day after our 
election, intruded into the bosom of the church, the bishop 
of Brague, who^ the preceding year had been excommuni-

digious crimen however, thanks to God, the soTereign empe- 
ror had no single Roman associate ; only the Guibertines^ 
Bomanns of St. Maroellus, Censiusi who was called of St

excesses in Dacia ; these alone transacted so shameless a deed. 
We command your wisdom, therefore, on the receipt of these 
presents^ that, deliberating on these matters in common, by 
the grace of God, yon be prepared, by his help, to avenge 
the mother church, as you are aware ought to be done by 
your joint assistance. Done at Graeta on the seventeenth

Grelasius after his expulsion, embarking at Salerno, came 
thence to Genoa, and afterwards proceeded by land to 
Clugny, where he died.* Then, that is a.d. 1119, the cardinals 
who had accompanied him, together with the whole Cisalpine 
church, elevating with great pomp Guido, archbishop of 
Vienne, to the papacy, called him Calixtus ; hoping, from the 
consideration of his pie^ and energy, that through his 
power, as he possessed great influence, they might be able to 
withstand the force of the emperor. Nor did he deceive 
their confidence : for soon after calling a council at Rheims, 
he separated £rom the churches such as had been, or should 
be, invested by the laity, including the emperor also, unless 
he should recant. Thus continuing for some time in the 
hither districts, to strengrthen his party, and having settled 
all afbirs in Gaul, he came to Rome, and was gladly received 
by the citizens^ as the emperor had now departed. Bourdin 
then, deserted, fled to Sutri, determining to nurture his 
power by many a pilgrim's loss ; but how he was qjected 
thence, the following epistle explains.

law of the Lord, and walk not in his judgments, Grod visits 
their iniquities with a rod, and their sins with stripes : 
but retaining the bowels of paternal love, he does not desert 
such as trust in his mercy. For a long time indeed, their 
sins so requiring, the faithful of the church have been 
disturbed by Bourdin, that idol of the king of Grermanj ; 
nay, some have been taken captive, others ^licted, through 
want in prison, even unto death. Lately, however, aflter 
celebrating the festival of Easter, when we could no IcMiger 
endure the complaints of the pilgrims, and of the poor, we 
left the city with the faithful servants of the church, and 
laid siege to Sutri, until the Divine power delivered that 
Bourdin aforesaid, the enemy of the church, who had there 
made a nest for the devil, as well as the place itself, entirely 
into our power. We beg your brotherly love therefore, with 
us, to return thanks to the King of kings, for such great 
benefits, and to remain most firmly in obedience and duty to 
the catholic church, as you will receive firom Gk»d Almighty, 
through his grace, due recompence for it^ both here and 
herea^er. We b^, too, that these letters be made public, 
with all due diligence. Done at Sutri on the fifth before 
the kalends of May." 

How exquisite and refined a piece of wit^ to call the man 
he hated, the idol of the king of Germany ! for the emperor 
certainly held in high estimation Maurice's skill in literature 
and politics. He was, as I have said, bishop of Brague, a 
city of Spain : a man whom any one might higlily reverence, 
and almost venerate, for his active and unweai*ied assiduity ; 
had he not been led to make himself conspicuous by so 
disgraceful an act : nor would he have hesitated to purchase 
the holy see, if he could have found as desperate a seller as 
he was a buyer. But being taken, and made a monk, he was 
sent to the Den,* for so is the monastery called. 

The laudable magnanimity of the pope proceeded still 
farther in the promotion of justice, to the end that he might 
repress the boundless and innate cupidity of the BomAns.

A^.1119.] POPE GALIXTUS n. 467 

In bis time there were no snares laid for the trayeller in the 
neighbourhood of Borne ; no assaults on him when he arrived 
within the city. The offerings to St. Peter, which, through 
insolence, and for their lusts, the powerful used to pillage, 
basely injuring such preceding popes as dared to complain, 
Calixtus brought back to their proper use ; that is to say, for 
the public service of the ruler of the holy see. Neither 
could the desire of amassing money, nor the love of it when 
collected, produce in his breast any thing repugnant to 
justice : so that he admonished the English pilgrims, on 
account of the length of the journey, rather to go to St. 
David's * than to Rome ; allowing the benefit of the same . 
benediction to such as went twice to that place, as resulted 
to those who went once to Rome. Moreover that inveterate 
controversy between the empire and the priesthood, con- 
cerning investiture, which for more than fifty years had 
created commotions, to such a degree, that^ when any 
favourer of this heresy was cut off by disease or death, 
immediately, like the hydra's heads, many sprouted up 
afresh ; tlus man by his diligence cut of^ brought low, 
rooted out, or plucked up : beating down the crest of 
German fierceness by the vigorous stroke of the papal 
hatchet This, the declaration of the emperor, and of the 
pope, will shew to the world in the following words : 

** I, Calixtus, bishop, servant of the servants of Grod, do 
grant unto you, my beloved son, Henry Augustus, by the 
grace of God, emperor of the Romans, that the election of 
bishops and abbats of the German empire, who pertain to 
the regality, shall take place in your presence without 
simony, or any violence : so that if any discord shall arise 
between the parties, you may give your assent, or aid, to the 
worthier side, by the counsel or judgment of the metropolitan 
or sufiragans : but the elect shall receive the royalties from 
you, and do whatever, by these, he is lawfully bound to 
perform to you : but any one consecrated in the other parts 
of the empire, shall, within six months, receive his royalties 
from you, by your sceptre, and do whatever, by these, he is 
lawfuUy bound to perform to you ; all things excepted which 
are known to belong to the Roman church. Moreover in 
those matters whereof you have complained, and demanded

this emperor, who, in militar7 glor7 trod fast upon the 
footsteps of Charles the Great, neither d^^nerated firom his 
devotion to Grod : for, in addition to nobl7 quelling tho

rebeUions of hig Grennan empire, he subdued his Italian 
dominions in such wise as none had done before. Entering 
Italy thrice, within the space of ten years, he restrained the 
pride of the cities : at his first coming he extermii^ated by fire, 
Novariay Phicentiay Arezzo: at the second, and third, 
Cremona^ and Mantua ; and quieted the sedition at Ravenna, 
by a siege of a few days' continuance : for the Pisans and 
Pavians, with the people of Milan, embraced his friendship, 
rather than encounter the weight of his enmity. The 
daughter of the king of England, who^ as I said before, was 
married to him, resembled her father in fortitude, and her 
mother in sanctity : piety and assiduity vied with each other 
in her character, nor was it easy to discern, which of her 
good qualities was most commendable. 

At that time lived William earl of Poitou ; a giddy un- 
settled kind of man; who^ after* he returned from Jeru- 
salem, as the preceding book relates, wallowed as completely 
in the sty of vice, as though he had believed that all things 
were-goTemed by chance, and not by Providence. More- 
over, he rendered his absurdities pleasant, by a kind of 
satiiical wit: exciting the loud laughter of his hearers. 
Finally he erected, near a castle called Niort, certain build- 
ings auer the form of a little monastery, and used to talk idly 
about placing therein an abbey of prostitutes, naming several 
of the most abandoned courtezans, one as abbess, another as 
prioress ; and declaring that he would fill up the rest of the 
offices in like manner. Repudiating his lawful consort, he 
carried off the wife of a certain viscount, of whom he was 
so desperately enamoured, that he placed on his shield the 
figure of this woman; affirming, that he was desirous of 
bearing her in battle, in the same manner as she bore him 
at another time. Being reproved and excommunicated for 
this by Girard bishop of Angouleme, and ordered to re- 
nounce this illicit amour, ''You shall curl with a comb," 
said he, ''the hair that has forsaken your forehead, ere I 
repudiate the viscountess;" thus taunting a man, whose 
scanty hair required no comb. Nor did he less when Peter 
bishop of Poitou, a man of noted sanctity, rebuked him

Still more freelj ; and, when contumacious, began to ex- 
communicate him publiclj : for, becoming furious, he seized 
the prelate bj the hair, and flourishing his drawn sword: 
^* You shall die this instant," said he, '^ unless 70U give me 
absolution." The bishop, then, counterfeiting alarm, and 
asking leave to speak, boldlj completed the remainder of 
the form of excommunication; suspending the earl so en- 
tirely from all Christian intercourse, that he should neither 
dare to associate, nor speak with any one, unless he speedily 
recanted. Thus fulfilling his duty, as it appeared to him, 
and thirsting for the honour of martyrdom, he stretched oat 
his neck, saying, '< Strike, strike." But William, bec<Mniiig 
somewhat softened, regained his usual pleasantry, and said, 
^' Certainly I hate you so cordially, that I will not dignify 
you by the effects of my anger, nor shall you ever enter 
heaven by the agency of my hand." After a short time, 
however, tainted by the infectious insinuations of this aban- 
doned woman, he ^ve the rebuker of his incest into banish- 
ment : who there, making a happy end, manifested to the 
world, by great and frequent miracles, how gloriously he 
survives in heaven. On hearing this, the earl abstained 
not &om his inconsiderate speeches, openly declaring, that 
he was sorry he had not despatched him before; that 80 
his pure soul might chiefly have to thank him, through 
whose violence he had acquired eternal happiness. The 
following verses are a tribute of applause to the life and 
death of Peter. It was said of him, when alive, — 

Coane food, his body : and the poor, his store 
Consum'd : while study morals gave, and lore. 
Virtues he rear'd, check'd faults, encouraged right. 
And law : in peace, not tumult, did delight. 
Help to the wretch, to ainnezs pardon gives, 
And, for his friend, his ardour ever lives. 
Buay for man was Martha; Mary's heart, 
Intent on God, assumed the better part : 
So 'twas in him; for God his soul possessed, 
Unmix'd : his friendless neighbour had the rest. 
Rachael he lov*d : nor Leah's hopes deprive 
Of joy : another Jacob, doubly-wiv*d; 
Dotes on the one, for beauty's matchlea grace; 
Regards the other, for her numerous zace. 

And when dead, it was said of huq, —

The contemporaries and associates in religion of this 
Peter, were Robert de Arbrisil,* and Bemardf abbat of 
T^ron, the first of whom was the most celebrated and elo* 
qnent preacher of these times : so much did he excel, not in 
firothj, but honejed diction, that from the gifts of persons 
Tying with each other in making presents, he founded that 
Boble monastery of nuns at Font-Evraud, in which eveiy 
secular pleasure being extirpated, no other place possesses 
such multitudes of devout women, fervent in their obedience 
to Grod. For in addition to the rejection of other allure- 
ments, how great is this ! that they never speak but in the 
chapter: the rule of constant silence being enjoined by the 
superior, because, when this is broken, women are prone to 
▼ain talk. The other, a noted admirer of poverty, leaving a 
most opulent monastery, retired with a few followers into a 
woody and sequestered place, and there, " As the light could 
not be hidden under a bushel," vast numbers flocking to him, 
he founded a monastery, more celebrated for the piety and 
number of the monks, than for the splendour and extent of 
its riches. 

And, that England may not be supposed destitute of vir- 
tue, who can pass by Serlo, abbat of Gloucester, who ad- 
vanced that place, almost from meanness and insignificance^ 
to a glorious pitdi ? All England is acquainted with the

maj embrace, and the strong cannot despise. Their leader, 
Serlo's axiom, was, ''Moderation in all things.* Although 
mild to the good, he was fierce and terrific to the haughly ; 
to corroborate which, I shall insert the verses of Grodfrey 
the prior concerning him :— -

And pleas'd the raj piincet he repror'd :

Who can in silence pass Lanax), who flourished at that 
time, equal to anj in sanctity ? A monk of Clugn j, and 
prior of St. Panoras* in England; who, by his worth, so 
ennobled that place with the grace of monastic reverence, 
that it might be justly declared the peculiar halntadon of 
virtue. As nothing I can say will equal the merits of his 
life^ I shall merely subjdn, in the language I found it, an 
account of his death ; that it may plainly appear, how glori- 
ously he had lived, who died so highly fiivoured. 

** The aSectianate Lord who scourges eYery son whom he 
receives, — who promises the just^ ti^t they shall be par- 
takers of his sidferings as well as of his consolation ; per- 
mitted Lanxo to approach his death by such bitter sickiMaB^ 
during three days, that if any spot £rom earthly intercourse 
had adhered to his pure soi^ it must no doubt have beea 
wiped away by that suffering. For, as that great apostle^ 
who reclined on the breast of our Lord, says, ^ If we say 
that we have no sin we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not 
in us ;' and since Christ will judge every sin, either Ughtily 
here or more severely hereafter, he was unwilling that any 
offence should be in the way of him after death, whom be 
knew to have loved him with all his heart. Wlierefore^ if 
there was anything which he thought worthy <if examina- 
tion in Lansoy he was desirous of consuming it in his life- 
time. To this assertion his confidence in death bore witness. 
For when in full health, on the fifth day of the week before 
the passion of our Lord, having read the psalter, according

to the dailjr custom of Lent, and being about to celebrate 
mass at the third hour, he had robed himself to the chasuble,* 
and had proceeded in the service till mass was oa the eve of 
b^inning, he was suddenly seized with such an acute dis- 
order, that himself laying aside the garments he had put <«, 
he left them not even folded up.^ Departing from the ora« 
tory, he was afflicted for two days, without intermission, that 
is, till the Saturday, haying no rest either sitting, walking, 
standing, lying, or deeping. During the nights, however, 
he never spoke to his brethren, though entreating him to 
break silence; but to this he did not consent^ beseeching 
them not to sully the purity of his vow ; for since he had 
assumed the monastic habit, whenever he had gone out from 
complines, he had never spoken till primes of the ensuing 
day. But on the Saturday, though so convulsed as to expect 
dissolution every moment^ he commanded the brethren, now 
rising for matins, to come and anoint him : and when he was 
anxious to kiss them, after being anointed, as is the custom, 
through excess of love he salut^ them, not lying or sitting, 
bat, ti^ough agonized to death, standing, supported in their 
arms. At dawn, bdng conducted to the chapter-house^l 
when he had taken his seat, he asked all the brethren to 
come before him, and giving them the paternal benediction 
and absolution, he entreated the like from them. He then 
instructed them what they were to do in case he died : and 
80^ returning whence he came, he passed the rest of the day 
with the succeeding Sunday, ratiier more tranquilly ; but, 
behold, after this, that is, after Sunday, signs of approaching 
death were discovered; and having his hands washed, and 
bis hair combed, he entered the oratory to hear mass ; and 
receiving the body and blood of the Lord retired to his bed. 
After a short time he became speechless, gave his benedic- 
tion to the brethren singly as they came before him, and in 
like manner to the whole sodely. But lifting his eyes to 
heaven, he attempted with both hands to bless the abbat, 
with all committed to his charge. Being entreated by the 
fraternity to be mindful of them with the Lord, to whom he 
was going, he most kindly assented by an inclination of bis

head. After he had done thns, he beckoned for the cross to 
be presented to him, which, adoring with his head and indeed 
Willi his whole bodj, and embracing with his hands, he ap- 
peared to salate with joyful lips and to kiss with fond affectioQ, 
when he distressed the standers-bj with signs of departing, 
and, being caught up in their arms, was carried yet alive 
into the presbytery before the altar of St Pancras. Here, 
surviying yet a time, and pleasing from the rosy hue of his 
countenance, he departed to Christy pure, and freed et^nally 
from every evil, at the same hour of the day on which, for 
his purification, he had been stricken with disease. And 
behold how wonderfully all things corresponded ; the passion 
of the servant with the passion of the Lord ; the hour of 
approaching sickness with the hour of approaching eternal 
happiness ; the five days of illness which he endured for pu- 
rifying the five senses of the body, through which none can 
avoid sin. Moreover, from his dying ere the completion of 
the fifth day, I think it is signified that he had never sinned 
in the last sense which is called the touch. And what else 
can the third hour of the day, in which he feU sick, and by 
dying entered into eternal life, signify, than that the same 
grace of the Holy Spirit, by which we know his whole life 
was regulated, was evidently present to him, both in his 
sickness and Ids death. Besides, we cannot doubt but that 
he equalled our fathers Odo and Odilo,* both in virtue and 
in its reward, as a remarkable circumstance granted to them 
was allowed to him also. For as the Lord permitted them to 
die on the octaves of those festivals which they loved beyond 
all other, (as St. Odo chiefly loved the feast of St. Mturtin, 
and St. Odilo the nativity of our Lord, and each died on the 
octaves of these tides), so to Lanzo, who beyond all of this 
age observed the rule of St Benedict^ and venerated the 
holy mother of Grod and her solemnities with singular re- 
galed, it happened that, as, according to his usual custom, 
both on the demise of St Benedict, and on the festival of 
St Mary, which is called the Annunciation, he celebrated 
high mass in the convent : so on the eighth from the afore- 
said anniversary of St Benedict, being stricken with sick* 
ness, he also on the eighth day from the annunciation de-

parted to Christ Wherefore, he who is unacquainted with 
the life of Lanzo, maj learn £rom his death, how pleasing it 
was to Grod, and will helieve with us that these things, which 
I have mentioned, did not happen after the common course 
of dying persons, .as he was a man surpassed bj none, in the 
present times, for the gifts of the H0I7 Spirit." 

Nor ought the memory of Grodfrey, prior of Winchester, 
to decay, who was celebrated in these times for his learning 
and his piety : his learning is attested by many works and 
epistles composed in his familiar and pleasing style, but prin- 
cipally by his epigrams, written after the manner of satires, 
and lus verses in celebration of the chief personages of Eng- 
land.* Indeed he restored every divine office to its native 
grace, from the manner in which he treated it, though before 
it had become obsolete from antiquity. The laws of religion 
and of hospitality, already happily traced out, he strongly im- 
pressed on the monks, who to this day so closely follow the 
footsteps of the prior in both, that they deserve all or nearly 
all possible commendation ; indeed in this house there is a 
plac^ of entertainment to any extent, for travellers of every 
description by sea or land, with boundless expense and cease- 
less attention. Among other things this holy man was noted 
for his humility, so that nothing but what savoured of mo- 
desty and sweetness proceeded from this singular depository 
of philosophy. How great indeed must this commendation 
seem ? for there is hardly any one, even the least tinctured 
with learning, who does not appear to consider others be- 
neath his dignity, by his haughty gestures and proud gait 
proclaiming the consciousness of his own erudition. How- 
ever, that no perfection might be wanting to his pure soul, 
he kept his lowly bed for many years, equally consuming 
his vitals and his transgressions in the furnace of lasting 
sickness. 

But why should I enlarge on such characters? There 
were, indeed, at that time in England many persons illustri- 
ous both for learning and for piety, whose virtue was the more 
commendable in proportion to its constancy and vigour in

these degenerate times. By a Uameless life, therefore, thej 
gave cr^bility to ancient histories, and freed them from any 
suspicion of falsehood, as thej produced modem example of 
the possibilitj of doing what was there recorded. More- 
over, were there any prelates apparently degenerating from 
the sanctity of ancient times, that b to say, slalled in secular, 
indolent in spiritual matters? If there were sudi, I say, 
they endeavoured to shade their failings by costly orna- 
ments for their cathedrals. Each of them erected new 
diurches, and adorned the bodies of their saints with 
silver and gold; lavish of expense to secure the good 
opinion of the beholders. Among these is Banulf before- 
mentioned, who, being made bishop of Durham, purchased 
some glory for his name, by new buildings for the monks, 
and by regard to St Cuthbert His £une is exahed by h|s 
translation of the holy body, which when taken from its 
resting-place he exhibited to all who wished to behold it 
Badul^ at that time bishop of Sees, and afterwards arch- 
bishop of Canterbury, with fortunate temerity, handled and 
displayed the uncorrupted body ; for it had become matter of 
doubt with certain persons whether the miracle of the inoor- 
ruption of the corpse, which had formerly been reported, still 
had effect About the same time, in the monastery of Ely, 
under abbat Richard, the virgin reliques of St Etheldritha, 
subjects of amaze and reverence to the beholders, were aeen 
entire. This monastery, lately changed by king Henry into 
a bishopric, had Hervey, as its first prelate ; who^ from the 
scantiness of its revenues, had deserted Bangor, where he 
had been enthroned. And that the bishop of lincoln might 
not complain of the mutilation of his diocese, the king made 
up his loss, out of the possessions of Ely, and satisfied his 
djEum. Indeed, whatever, in his time^ was unjustly purloined, 
or violently taken, from the primacy of the two metropolitans 
of Canterbury and York, I will i^ate in its proper place. 
For having now ended the series of the kings, it seems 
incumbent on me, to speak of that of the bishops of aU 
England: and here I wish I had abundant matter fot 
relation, in order that such splendid luminaries of the 
country might no longer be lost in obscurity. Moreover, 
there will perhaps be many in different parts of England, 
who may say, that they have heard and read some things

differently related from tlie mode in which I hare recorded 
them : but if they judge candidly, they will not, on this 
account, brand me with censure : since, following the strict 
laws of history, I have asserted nothing but what I have 
learned either from relators, or writers, of veracity. But be 
these matters as they may, I espedally congratulate myself 
on being, through Christ's assistance, the only person, or at 
least the first, who^ since Bede, have arranged a continued 
history of the English. Should any one, therefore, as I 
already hear it intimated, undertake, after me, a work of a 
similar nature, he may be indebted to me for haying collected 
materials, though the selection from them must depend upon 
biijKself . * 

Thus much then, my Tenerated lord, I have had to relate^ 
concerning the histoiy of the English, from their first arrival 
in this country, till ^e twentieth year of your father's most 
happy reign : the remainder will occupy a separate volume, 
if you condescend a kind regard to these. For when I had 
finished this work, after contemplating many characters, I 
determined that it ought more especially to be dedicated to 
you : as, when I examine others, I observe nobility in one ; 
in another military science ; in a third learning ; justice in a 
fourth ; but munificence in few indeed. Thus, I admire 
some things in one, some in another ; but in you the 
aggregate of alL For, if ever any man was truly noUe, 
you certainly excel in that quality ; being descended from 
the most glorious kings and earls, and resembling them in 
your disposition. From the Normans, therefore, you derive 
your military skill ; from the Flemings your personal 
elegance ; from the French your surpassing mumfioence. 
Of your activity in war, who can doubt, when your most 
excellent father himself looks up to it ? For whenever any 
tumults are reported in Normandy, he despatches you before 
him, in order that, what is suspicious may be dispdled by 
your valour, and peace may be restored by your sagacily. 
When he returns to his kingdom, he brings you with him, 
as a safeguard to him abroad, a delight at home^ and an 
ornament every where. 

So devoted are you to literature, that though distracted by

8acb a mass of business, you yet snatch some hours to 
yourself for the purpose either of reading, or of hearing 
others. Justly do you reguhtte, indeed, your exalted rank 
in life, neither omitting the toils of war for literature, nor 
contemning literature, as some do^ for military service. 
Here, also, the excess of your learning appears ; for, whilst 
you love books, you manifest how deeply you hare dnmk of 
the stream. For many things, indeed, are eagerly desired 
when not possessed, but no person will love philosophy, who 
shall not have imbibed it thoroughly. The fame of your 
justice reaches even our parts ; for a false sentence has never 
been extorted from you, either by elevation of rank, or by 
scantiness of fortune. The person who wishes to subvot 
justice, finds in your breast nothing conducive to his design, 
either by the offering of presents, or by the charm of favour. 
Your munificence and disregard of money, is amply shown 
by the monastery of Tewkesbury ; from which, as I hear, 
you not only do not extort presents but even return its 
voluntary offerings. You must be well aware, how nobis 
such a proceeding is, more especially at the present time ; 
how much it redounds to your glory among men, how 
productive of the favour of Grod. Happy, then, according 
to Plato, is the republic whose ruler is a philosopher, whose 
sovereign delights not in gifts. More could I add on such 
subjects, did not the suspicion of flattery on my part, and 
commendable modesty on yours, restrain my tongue. In 
truth, my design was, not to pass by in silence the things I 
have uttered, m order that, by my agency, your worth might 
reach posterity ; and that it may continue to proceed from 
virtue to virtue. Moreover, it was long since my intention, 
at the instance of certain persons, to subjoin to this wori^, 
whatever I may deem of importance, according to the 
successive years : but it appears advisable rather to form 
another volume of such matters, than to be perpetually 
adding to that already completed. Nor can any one say, 
that I engage in a superfluous work, if I record the 
transactions of the most celebrated among the kings of his 
time. Indeed my lowly condition is much indebted to his 
greatness, and will be still more so^ were it for nothing else, 
than his being able to pride himself on such a son.* For,

when he had most anspiciouslj begotten, he first commanded 
jou to be instmctedy not saperfidallj, as plainly appears at 
the present day, in science ; he next made you master of a 
most princely fortune ; and, at this moment he reposes his 
paternal regards upon you. Let this volume then, whatever 
its merits or' defects, be altogether dedicated to your fame ; 
in the next my life and my history will terminate together. 
Farther, kindly accept this my ofiering, that I, whose judg- 
ment has not erred in its choice, may be gratified by the good 
wishes of my patron.

THE MODERN HISTORY- 



PBEFACE, 

ADDRESSED TO BOB^Ty EAKL OF OLOUCSSTES. 

To biB most loving lord, Robert) son of king Henry, and earl 
of Gloucester, William, librarian of Mahnesbury, wishes, 
after completing his victorious coarse on earth, eternal 
triumph in heaven. Many of the transactions of your 
father, of glorious memory, I have not omitted to record, 
both in the fifth book of my Regal History, and in those 
three smaller volumes, which I Imve intituled Chronicles.* 
Your highness is now desirous that those events whicb, 
through the miraculous power of Grod, have taken place in 
modem time, in England, should be transmitted to posterity: 
truly, like all your other desires, a most noble one. For 
what more concerns the advancement of virtue ; what more 
conduces to justice ; than to recognize the divine favour 
towards good men, and his vengeance upon the wicked? 
What, too, can be more grateful, than to commit to the page 
of history, the exploits of brave men, by whose example 
others may shake off thdr indolence, and take up arms in 
defence of their country ? As this task is oomndtted to my 
pen, I think the narrative will proceed with exacter order, 
if, going back a little, I trace the series of years from the 
return of the empress into England, after the death of her 
husband. First, therefore, invoking the help of Grod, 
as is fitting, and purposing to write the truth, without 
listening to enmity, or sacrificing to favour, I shall begin 
as follows.

BOOK I. 

In the twenty-sixth year of Henry king of England, which 
was A.D. 1126, Henry, emperor of Grermany, to whom Ma- 
tilda the aforesaid kuig's daughter had been married, died* 
in the Yerj bloom of his life and of his conquests. Our king 
was at that time residing in Normandy, to quell whatever 
tumults might arise in those parts. As soon as he heard of 
the death of his son-in-law, he recalled his daughter by 
honourable messengers despatched for that purpose. The 
empress, as they say, returned with reluctance, as she had 
be(X)me habituated to the country which was her dowry, and 
had large possessions there. It is well known, that several 
princes of Lorraine and Lombardy came, during succeeding 
years, repeatedly into England, to demand her as their sove- 
reign ; but they lost the £ruit of their labours, the king de- 
signing, by the marriage of his daughter, to procure peace 
between himself and the earl of Anjou. He was certainly, 
in an extraordinary degree, the greatest of all kings in the 
memory either of ourselves, or of our fathers : and yet never- 
theless, he ever, in some measure, dreaded the power of the 
earls of Anjou. Hence it arose, that he broke off and an- 
nulled the espousals which William, his nephew, afterwards 
earl of Flanders, was said to be about to contract with the 
daughter of Fuloo, earl of Anjou, who was afterwards king 
of Jerusalem. Hence, too, it arose, that he united a daugh- 
ter of the same earl to his son William, while yet a stripling ; 
and hence it was, that he married his daughter, of whom we 
began to speak, after her imperial match, to a son of the 
same Fuloo, as my narrative will proceed to disclose. 

In the twenty-seventh year of his reign, in the month of 
September, king Henry came to England, bringing his 
daughter with him. But, at the ensuing Christmas, con- 
vening a great number of the clergy and nobility at London, 
he gave the county of Salop to his wife, the daughter of the 
earl of Louvain, whom he had married after the death of 
Matilda. Distressed that this lady had no issue, and fearing

lest she should be perpetoallj childless, with well-foimded 
anxiety, he turned his thoughts on a successor to the king- 
dom. On which subject, having held much preyious and 
long-continued deliberation, he now at this council ccxnpelled 
all the nobilitj of England, as well as the bishops and abbats, 
to make oath, that, if he should die without mide issue, thej 
would, without delay or hesitation, accept his daughter Ma- 
tilda, the late empress, as their sovereign : observing, how 
prejudiciallj to the country fate had snatched awaj Ms son 
William, to whom the kingdom by right had pertained : and, 
that his daughter still survived, to whom alone the legitimate 
succession belonged, from her grandfather, uncle, and father, 
who were kings ; as well as from her -maternal descent for 
many ages back : inasmuch as from Egbert, king of the West 
Saxons, who first subdued or expelled the other kings of the 
island, in the year of the incarnation 800,* through a line of 
fourteen kings, down to a.d. 1043, in which king Edward, 
who lies at Westminster, was elevated to the throne, the line 
of royal blood did never fail, nor falter in the succes8ion.f 
Moreover, Edward, the last, and at the same time the most 
noble, of that stock, had united} Mai^aret, his grand-niece 
by his brother Edmund Ironside, to Mdcolm, king of Scot- 
land, whose daughter Matilda, as was well known, was the 
empress's mother. All therefore, in this council, who were 
considered as persons of any note, took the oath : and first of 
all William, archbishop of Canterbury ; next the other bi- 
shops, and the abbats in like manner. The first of the laity, 
who swore, was David, king of Scotland, uncle of the em- 
press ; then Stephen, earl of Moreton and Boulogne, nephew 
of king Henry by his sister Adala ; then Robert, the king's 
son, who was bom to him before he came to the throne, and 
whom he had created earl of Gloucester, § bestowing on him

in marriage Mabil, a noble and excellent woman ; a lady 
devoted to her husband, and blessed in a nnmerons and beau- 
tiful o£&pring. There was a singular dispute, as thej relate, 
between Robert and Stephen, contending with rival virtue, 
which of them should take the oath first ; one alleging the 
privilege of a son, the other the dignity of a nephew. Thus 
all being bound by fealty and by oadi, they, at that time, de- 
parted to their homes ; but after Pentecost, the king sent his 
daughter into Normandy, ordering her to be betrothed,* by 
the archbishop of Rouen, to the son of Fulco aforesaid, a 
youth of high nobility and noted courage. Nor did he him- 
self delay setting sail for Normandy, for the purpose of uni- 
ting them in wedlock. Which being completed, all declared 
prophetically, as it were, that, after his death, they would 
break their plighted oath. I have frequently heard Roger, 
bishop of Salisbury, say, that he was freed from the oath he 
had taken to the empress : for that he had sworn condition- 
ally, that the king should not marry his daughter to any one 
out of the kingdom without his consent, or that of the rest of 
the nobility : that none of them advised the match, or indeed 
knew of it, except Robert, earl of Gloucester, and Brian 
Fitzcount, and the bishop of Louviers. Nor do I relate this 
merely because I believe the assertion of a man who knew 
how to accommodate himself to every varying time, as for- 
tune ordered it ; but, as an historian of veracity, I write the 
general belief of the people. 

The remaining years of the life and reign of Henry, I 
must review briefly, in order that posterity may neither be 
defrauded of a knowledge of these events, nor that I may 
seem to dwell on topics little relevant to this history, hi 
his twenty-eighth year, the kingf returned from Normandy; 
in his twenty-ninth, a circumstance occurred in England 
which may seem surprising to our long-haired gallants, who, 
forgetting what they were bom, transform themselves into 
the fashion of femdes, by the length of their locks. A cer-

Ms tresses, being stung by oonscienoe on the sulgect, seemed 
to feel in a dream as tibiough some person strangled him with 
liis ringlets. Awaiking in a fright, he immediately cat off all 
his superfluous hair. The example spread throughont Eng- 
land ; and, as recent punishment is apt to aflfect the mind, 
almost all military men allowed their hair to be cropped in a 
proper manner, without reluctance. But this decency was 
not of long continuance ; for scarcely had a year expired, 
ere all who thought themselves courtly, relapsed into their 
former vice : they vied with women in length of locks, and 
wherever they were defective, put on false tresses ; foigetfol, 
or rather ignorant, of the saying of the apostle, ^ If a man 
nurture his hair, it is a shapie to him."* 

In his thirtieth year, Idng Henry went into Normandy. 
Pope Honorius dying in this year, the church of Rome was 
agitated by great contentions about electing his sucoeasor. 
Tniiere were, at that time, in the city, two very celebrated 
cardinals, Gregory, deacon of Su Angdo^ and Peter, cardi- 
nal-priest, son of Leo, prince of the Romans ; both noted for 
learning, and activity, nor could the people easily discern 
which of them more justly ought to be elected by the ckrgj. 
The party, however, which favoured Gregory took the lead, 
and ordaining him pope, called him Innocent Moreover a 
rumour was disseminated among the people, that Honoriiis 
was still just alive, and had commanded this to be done. Tlie 
promoters of this choice were, William, bishop of Prsneate, 
Matthew of Albano^ Conrad of Sabina, John of Ostia, Peter 
of Crema, cardinal «f St. Chrysogonus, and Haimer the 
chancellor. But the other party, after Honorius was buried, 
at the instigation of Peter's brothers, who were the most 
opulent and powerful of the Romans, having elected and oqd- 
secrated him, gave him the name of Anadet The c^ef 
adviser and instigator to this ordination was Peter, bishop of 
Porto, whose letter, if I subjoin it, will disclose the whole 
controver&y ; although it inclines rather to Anadet 

' It is veiy remarkable what exceeBive pains were employed to pieTBiI 
on the young men to part with their locks. In the conncfl held at Loodon 
by archbishop Anselm, aj>. 1102, it is enacted, that thoee who had losj^ 
hair should he cropped, ao as to show part of the ear, and the eyes. Fram 
the apparently strange manner in which this fashion is coupled in Bdmcr, 
p. 81, one might be led to suspect, it was something more than mere spleoi 
which caused this enactment. See also Oideric. Vitalis.

" Peter, bishop of Porto, to the four bishops, William of 
Pneneste, Matthew of Albano, Conrad of Sabina, John of 
Ostia. How great is the tribulation of mj heart for you, he 
only knows, who knows all things ; indeed, you would have 
already been acquainted with it, in part, by my letters, did 
not the sentence and the common authority of the church 
prohibit. Of the praise or dispraise of those persons, con- 
cerning whom various discourses are at present held, it is 
not of this world to judge : there is who may seek and judge. 
But if any be ready to accuse, one will be i^ady, and who is 
also bound, to reply ; more especially when both in your and 
my sight, and in that of the whole church, each of them has 
lived discreetly and honestly ; and has hitherto executed his 
office impartially. It rather concerns you to abstain from 
idle language and the words of haste. J£ the question be of 
report, the business is far different &om what your letters to 
me declare. In addition to this, if you regard the accounts 
you have published, and the order of proceeding, with due 
reverence be it spoken, by what boldness, by what assurance, 
do you presume to call that usurpation of yours an election ? 
Why do you call that man of yours ordained, when there 
was no order whatever in his case ? Have you so learned to 
elect a pope ? What, in a corner, in a hidden place, in dark" 
ness, and in the shadow of death ? K you were desirous 
that a living should succeed to a dead pope, why would you 
give out t^t the deceased was still iQive? It were much 
better, surely, to pay the last sad offices to the dead, and in 
this manner provide for the succour of the living: but, 
behold, while you seek succour for the living from the dead, 
you destroy both the living and the dead at the same time. 
Lastly, it was neither your office nor mine to elect; but 
rather to refuse, or to approve, when elected by the brethren. 
Since, therefore, in neglect of the ritual, contempt of the 
canon, and disregard of the very anathema, framed by your- 
selves ; without consulting me, your superior, or your elder 
brethren and superiors, or even summoning, or waiting for 
them ; when, you were inexperienced, and but very few in 
number, you have presumed to do this; you must be sen- 
sible, irom your own estimation of the case, that it must be 
considered void and of no avail whatever. The Lord, how- 
ever, was quickly present to us, and pointed out a method

whereby to obviate your error. For, indeed, your brethren 
the cardinals, who possess the chief power of electing to- 
gether with the whole clergy, at the request of the people, 
and with the consent of the nobility, openly, in the light of 
day, have unanimously, and heartily, elected the noble car- 
dinal Peter, as Roman pontiff, by the title of Anaclet. I 
have witnessed this election canonically celebrated ; and con- 
firmed it by the authority of God. The church accepts and 
venerates him ; and, by the grace of Grod, the bishops and 
abbats, chief princes and bi^ns, some by themselves, and 
others by their delegates, acknowledge him in our preseooe. 
The robbery and cruelty you mention, I do not perceive: 
whoever goes to him for consultation, or on business^ is 
kindly received, and still more kindly dismissed. Return, 
then, return to your understanding, do not make a schism in 
the church, to the perdition of souls : do not persist any hr- 
ther; let the fear of Grod possess you, not worldly shame: 
does any sleep, will he not add, that he must rise again? 
Cease now from lies, in which the wicked put their hope. 
The lord Tiburtius hath testified by oath, in writing, that I 
have deemed the deacon of St. Angelo, the only fit person 
for the office of pope : let him look to what he hath said: I 
have spoken nothing in secret; no person hath ever heard 
such a word as this from my moutL My opinion ahniys 
was, that till the pope was buried no mention shoold be 
made of his successor. I have held, and will hold, the nni^ 
of the church ; I will be careful to adhere to trulJi and jus- 
tice ; confidenUy hoping, that truth and justice will set me 
free." 

After this manner wrote the aforesaid Peter, bishop of 
Porto, rather partial to Peter, the son of Leo. Nor did the 
other party at all give way; but called Peter himself a lion^ 
whelp,* and his partizans, the leaders of a faction. And 
they, indeed, acted variously among themselves, under these 
doubtful circumstances. Innocent, however, excluded hem 
Rome, passed the Alps and went into France. Here he was 
immediately received by all the churches on this side the 
mountains; and moreover, even king Henry, who did not 
very well know how to be driven from an opinion he had 
once taken up, willingly acknowledged him at Chartres;

and, at lEtonen, condescended to honour him, not only with 
presents from himself, but also from the nobility, and eren 
the Jews. Yet Innocent, though greatly assisted by the 
kings of England and France, and the emperor of Germany, 
could never enjoy peace so long as Anaclet occupied the see 
of Rome. However, Anaclet himself dying in the eighth 
year of his usurped papacy, as it was called, Innocent enjoys 
the papal dignity unmolested to the present time.* 

In the thirty-first year of his reign, king Henry returned 
to England. The empress, too, in the same year, arrived*on 
her native soil, and a full meeting of the nobility being held 
at Northampton, the oath of fidelity to her was renewed by 
such as had already sworn, and also taken by such as 
hitherto had not. In the same yearf Lewis, king of France, 
growing aged and unwieldy through extreme corpulency, 
commanded his son to be crowned as successor to the king- 
dom; who dying soon after by the fall of his horse, he 
caused another of his sons to be consecrated king, by the 
hands of the Roman pontiff. He, as they relate, not dege- 
nerating from the ancient valour of the French, hath also 
acquired Aquitain, as the marriage portion of his wife, 
which, it is well known, the kings of France have never held 
in their own right since Lewis, son of Charles the Great. 

In the thirty-first { [second] year of king Henry, a dread- 
ful murrain among domestic animals extended over the 
whole of England. Entire herds of swine suddenly pe- 
rished ; whole stalls of oxen were swept off in a moment : 
the same contagion continued in the foUowing years, so that 
no village throughout the kingdom was free from this ca- 
lamity, or able to exult at the losses of its neighbours. At 
this time, too, the contention between Bernard, bishop of St. 
David's, and Urban, of Landaff, on the rights of their dio- 
ceses^ which Urban had illegally usurped, was finally put to

rest For, after being agitated by so many appeals to the 
court of Rome, so many expensive journeys, so many debates 
of lawyers, for a number of years, it was at last terminated, 
or rather cut short, by the death of Urban at Rcxne. The 
pope also^ weighing the equity of the case, did justice to the 
piety and right of the bishop of St. David's by a suitable 
judgment In the same year William, archlHshop of Can- 
terbury, personally obtained the legation of England, through 
the indulgence of the see of Rome. 

The day after the thirty-second* year of his reign was 
completed, Heniy, on the nones of August^ the very day on 
which he had formerly been crowned at Westminster, set sail 
for Normandy. This was the last, the fatal voyage of his 
reign. The providence of Grod, at that time^ bore referraioe 
in a wonderful manner to human affairs : for instance;, thai 
he should embark, never to return alive, on that day on 
which he had originally been crowned, so long and prosper- 
ously to reign. It was then, as I have said, the nones of 
August ; and, on the fourth day of the week, the eHemenls 
manifested their sorrow at this great man's last departoie. 
For the sun on that day,t at the sixth hour, 'shrouded his 
glorious &ce, as the poets say, in hideous darkness, agitating 
the hearts of men by an eclipse : and on the sixth day of the 
week, early in the morning, there was so great an earth- 
quake, that the ground appeared absolutely to sink down; 
a horrid sound being first heard from beneath the surface. 
During the eclipse I saw stars around the sun: and, at the 
time of the earthquake, the wall of the house in which I was 
sitting was lift^ed up by two shocks, and settled again with 
a third. The king, therefore^ continiied in N(Hrmandy in

the space of three* whole years, and so much longer, as from 
the nones of August, on which day, as has heen said, he 
crossed the sea, to the kalends of December, on which night 
he died. Doubtlessly he performed many things worthy of 
record while in Normandy, but it was my design to omit 
whatever did not come authenticated to my knowledge. 
Divers expectations of his return to England were all frus- 
trated, by some adverse fate, or by the will of Grod. 

He reigned, then, thirty-five years, and from the nones of 
August to the kalends of Dec^b^, that is, four months, 
wanting four days. Engaged in hunting at Lihun, he was 
taken suddenly iU. His malady increasing, he summoned to 
him, Hugo, whom, from prior of Lewes, he had made abbat 
of Beading, and afterwards archbishop of Rouen, who waa 
justly indebted to him and his heirs for such great favours. 
The report of his sickness quickly gathered the nobility 
around him. Robert, too, his son, the earl of Gloucester, 
was present ; who, from his unblemished fidelity and match- 
less virtue, has deserved to be especially signalized through- 
out all ages. Being interrogated by these persons, as to his 
successor, he awarded all his territories, on either side of the 
sea, to his daughter, in legitimate and perpetual succession ; 
being somewhat displeased with her husband, as he had irri- 
tated him both by threats and by certain injuries. Having 
passed the seventh day of his sickness, he yielded to nature 
about midnight. I waive describing his magnanimous charac- 
ter in this place, as I have been diffuse upon it in the fifth 
book of my Regfd History. In how Christian a manner he 
departed, the following epistle of the aforesaid archbishop of 
Bouen, will testify. 

''To his lord and father, pope Innocent, due obedience 
from his servant, Hugo, priest of Rouen. I have deemed it 
proper to write to your fatherly affection concerning the king 
my master, never to be remembered but with grief: for, 
b^ng seized with sudden sickness, he wished for me to con- 
sole his sufferings, and sent messengers as soon as possible 
for that purpose. I went, and passed three melancholy days 
with him. Agreeably to my suggestion, he confessed his 
sins, he beat his breast, and he laid aside all his animosities. 
Through the grace of God, and through our advice and that

of the Hflhops, he promised to attend to the amendment <^ 
his life. Under tins promise, according to our office, on the 
third day, and three days successiyely, we gave him absola- 
tion. He devoutly adored the cross of our Lord, received 
his hody and hlood ; bestowed his alms thus ; saying, * Let 
my debts be paid, let the wages* and stipends which I owe 
be discharged, let the remainder be distributed to the poor.' 
I wish they who held, and do hold, his treasures had dcme 
thus. At last I earnestly stated to him our duty concerning 
the unction of the sick, which the church adopted from the 
apostle St James, and, at his own devout request, I anointed 
him with holy oil. Thus he rested in peace ; and may God 
grant him the peace he loved." These circumstances relating 
to the faith of king Henry when dying, were truly attested 
by the aforesaid archbishop of Rouen. 

The body, royally attended and borne by the nobility in 
turn, was brought to Rouen ; where, in a certain retired part 
of the principal church, it was embowelled, lest, through 
time, becoming putrid, it should offend the senses of those 
who approached it. The intestines were buried in the 
monastery of St. Mary des Frees, near the city, which, as I 
hear, he had honoured with no mean presents, as it had been 
begun by his mother. His body was kept at Caen, till the 
season, which was then very boisterous, became more tran* 
quil. In the meantime, Stephen earl of Moreton and Bou- 
logne, nephew of king Henry, as I have before said, irho^ 
afler the king of Scotland, was the first layman that had 
sworn fidelity to the empress, hastened his return into Eng- 
land by Whitsand. The empress, from certain causes, as 
well as her brother, Robert earl of Gloucester, and almost all 
the nobility, delayed returning to the kingdom. However, 
some castles in Normandy, the principal of which was Dan- 
frunt, espoused the party of the heiress. Moreover, it is 
well known, that, on the day on which Stephen disembarked 
in England, there was, very early in the morning, oontraiy

to the nature of winter in these coontries, a terrible peal of 
fhonder, with most dreadful lightning, so that the world 
seemed well-nigh about to be ^ssolved. He was received, 
however, as king, bj the people of London and of Winches- 
ter, and gained over also Roger bishop of SaHsbnry, and 
William Font de L' Arche, the keepers of the royal treasures. 
Tet, not to conceal the truth from posterity, all his attempts 
would have been vain, had not his brother, Henry bishop of 
Winchester, who is now legate of the papid see in England, 
granted him his entire support : allured indeed by the fullest 
expectation that Stephen would foUow the example of his 
grandfather William in the management of the kingdom, 
and more especially in the strictness of ecclesiastical dis- 
cipline. In consequence, when Stephen was bound by the 
rigorous oath which William archbishop of Canterbury re- 
quired firom him, concerning restoring and preserving the 
liberty of the church, the bishop of Winchester became his 
pledge and surety. The written tenor of this oath, I shall 
be careful hereafter to insert in its proper place. 

Stephen, therefore, was crowned king of England on Sun- 
day the eleventh* before the kalends of January, the twenty- 
second day after the decease of his uncle, anno Dom. 1135, 
in the presence of three bishops, that is, the archbishop, and 
those of Winchester and Salisbury ; but there were no abbats, 
and scarcely any of the nobility. He was a man of activity, 
but imprudent : strenuous in war ; of great mind in attempt- 
ing works of difficulty ; mild and compassionate to his ene- 
mies, and affable to dl. Kind, as far as promise went ; but 
sore to disappoint in its truth and execution. Whence he 
soon afterwards neglected the advice of his brother, befriended 
by whose assistance, as I have said, he had supplanted his 
adversaries and obtained the kingdom. 

In the year of our Lord 1 135, on the prevalence of gentler 
gales, the body of king Henry was, immediately after Christ- 
mas, put on ship-board, and brought to England ; and, in 
the presence of his successor in the kingdom, was buried at 
the monastery of Reading, which he had liberally endowed, 
and filled with an order of monks of singular piety. Shortly 
after, a little before Lent, king Stephen went into Northum*

belaud, tliat he miglit have a conference with David kii^ of 
Scothmd, who was said to entertain hostile sentiments towards 
him. From David he readily obtained what he wished ; 
because, being softened by the natural gentleness of his 
manners, or by the approach of old age, he willinglj em* 
braced the tranquiUity of peace, real or pretended. 

In the same year, after Easter, Robert earl of Glouoester, 
of whose prudence Stephen chiefly stood in awe, came to 
England. While he was yet resident in Normandy, he had 
most earnestly considered, what line of conduct he should 
determine upon in the present state of affairs. If he be* 
came subject to Stephen, it seemed contrary to the oath he 
had sworn to his sister ; if he opposed him, he saw that he 
could nothing benefit her or his nephews, though he most 
grievously injure himself. For the king, as I said before, 
had an immense treasure, which his uncle had been acca- 
mulating for many years. His coin, and that of the best 
quality,* was estimated at a hundbred thousand pounds; 
besides which, there were vessels of gold and silver, of 
great weight, and inestimable value, collected by the mag- 
nificence of preceding kings, and chiefly by Henry.f A 
man possessed of such boundless treasures, could not want 
supporters, more especially as he was profuse, and, what by 
no means becomes a prince, even prodigaL Soldiers of aU 
kinds, and light-armed troops, were flocking to him, chiefly 
from Flanders and Brittany. These were a most rapacious 
and violent race of men; who made no scruple to violate 
church-yards,} or rob a church. Moreover, not only would 

* ^ Th« author of the Dialogiu de Scaccario states that for Bome time 
after the Norman conquest there was yerj tittle money in specie in tbe 
realm, and that, until the reign of Henxy the First, all rents and fiuma 
due to the king were rendered in provisions and necessaries for his home* 
hold ; but Heniy I ordered the payments to be made in money : they 
were consequently made *ad scaltun,' and 'ad pensumf 'in nnmero^'* or 
by tale; and 'per combustionem,' or melting, which latter mode wm 
adopted to prevent payment being made in debased money; hence perittps 
it was that Henry's money was of the best quality." — ^Ha&dt. 

f The progress of some of Henry'ta treasure is curious. Theobald, ear] 
of Blois, gave many jewels, which had been bestowed on him by Stepben, 
his brother, to certain abbeys, and these again sold them for four hundred 
pounds to Suger, abbat of St Denis. Henry, Suger observes, used to havQ 
them set in most magnificent drinking vessels. Suger, ap. Duchesncj, t, tv.

^ej drag men of the religious order from their horses, but 
also make them captive: and this was done not merely bj 
foreigners^ but even by the natiye soldiers, who had ab- 
horred the tranquillity of king Henry's time, because it 
subjected them to a life of poverty. All these most readily 
resorted to the prince whom they could easily incline to 
their purposes, pushing their fortune at the expense of the 
people. Stephen, indeed, before he came to the throne, 
from his complacency of manners, and readiness to joke, 
and sit, and regale, even with low people, had gained so 
much on their aJTections, as is hardly to be conceived: and 
already had all the nobility of England willingly acknow- 
ledged him. The most prudent earl therefore was extremely 
desirous to convince them of their misconduct, and recaU 
them to wiser sentiments by his presence; for, to oppose 
Stephen's power, he was unable, from the causes aforesaid : 
indeed he had not the liberty of coming to England, unless, 
appearing as a partaker of their revolt, he dissembled for 
a time his secret intentions. He did homage to the king, 
therefore, under a certain condition ; namely, so long as he 
should preserve his rank entire, and maintain his engage- 
ments to him; for having long since scrutinized Stephen's 
disposition, he foresaw the instability of his faith. 

In the same year, soon after the earl's arrival, the bishops 
swore fidelity to the king, "so long as he should maintain 
the liberty of the church, and the vigour of its discipline." 
He himself also swore according to the tenor of the fol- 
lowing instrument. 

" I Stephen, by the grace of God, elected king of England 
by the consent of the clergy^ and of the people, and conse- 
crated by the lord William, archbishop of Canterbury and 
legate of the holy Roman church, and afterwards confirmed 
by Innocent, pope of the holy Roman see, through respect 
and love towards God, do grant the holy church to be free, 
and confirm to it all due reverence. I promise that I will 
neither do any thing simoniacally, nor permit it to be done, 
in the church, or in matters ecclesiastical. The jurisdiction 
and power over beneficed clergy, and over all persons in 
orders, and their property, and the distribution of efiects of 
ecclesiastics, I admit to be in the hands of the bishops, and 
confinn it so to be. I grant and appoint, that the immu- 



494 KOPERN HISTOBT. CB.f. 

nides of the chorcheSy confirmed by their charters, and thdr 
customs observed from ancient usage, do remain inriolate. 
All the possessions of the churches, and the tenures which 
thej held during the life, and at the death of mj grand- 
father king TVilUam, I grant to them free, and discharged 
from the claim of all parties : but if the church shall here- 
after claim any thing held, or possessed, before the dealii of 
the king, of which it is now deprived, I reserve such matter 
for discussion, or restitution at mj wiU and pleasure. More- 
over, whatever, since that king's death, has been obtained 
by ike liberalitj of kings, or the gift of princes ; bj offer- 
ings, or purchase, or bj any exchange of the faithful, I con- 
fiim I pledge mysdf to keep peace, and do justice to aU, 
and to 'preserve them to my utmost ability. I reserve to 
myself the forests which king William, my grandfather, and 
William the Second, my uncle, have made and possessed : aQ 
the rest which king Henry added, I give and grant, without 
molestation, to the churches, and the kingdom. And if any 
bishop or abbat, or other ecclesiastical person, shall have 
severally distributed* his property before his death, or ap- 
pointed such distribution, I allow it to remain good: but if 
he shall have been suddenly seized by death, before making 
a disposition, let the said distribution be made, at the dis- 
cretion of the church, for the repose of his souL More- 
over, when the sees shall be vacant, let both them, and their 
whole possessions, be committed into the hands and custody 
of the clergy, or of lawful men of the same church, until a 
pastor be canonically appointed. I entirely do away all 
exactions, mischeningas,t and injustices, whether illegally 

* It had been the practice to seize, to the king's nae, whatever propoty 
ecclesiastics left behind them. Heniy of Huntingdon relates, that on the 
death of Gilbert the Universal, bishop of London, who was remarkable for 
his avarice, all his effects, and among the rest, his boots crammed with gold 
and silver, were conveyed to the exchequer. Anglia Sacra, ii. 698. Some- 
times, even what had been distributed on a death-bed, was reclaimed Ibr 
the king. Vide 6. Neub. 3, 5. '* This practice of seizing the property of 
ecclesiastics at their death seems subsequoitljr to have settled down iato a 
claim on the part of the king of the cup and palfrey of a deceased bishop, 
prior, and abbat. See Rot. ClauB. 39 Hen. Ill, m. 17, in dorao.*' — Hardt.

The names of the witnesses, who were numerous, I dis- 
dain to particularize, because he as basely perverted ahnost 
every tbiing, as if he had sworn only that he might manifest 
himself a violator of his oath to the whole kingdom. This 
easy man must pardon me for speaking the truth ; who, had 
he entered on the sovereignty lawfully, and not given a 
ready ear to the insinuations of the malevolent in the ad- 
ministration of it, would have wanted little in any princely 
quality. Under him, therefore, the treasures of several 
churches were pillaged, and their landed possessions given 
to laymen ; the churches of the clergy were sold to foreign- 
ers; the bishops made captive, or forced to alienate their 
property ; the abbeys given to improper persons, either 
through the influence of firiendship, or for the discharge of 
debts. Still I think such transactions are not so much to be 
ascribed to him as to his advisers ; who persuaded him, that, 
he ought never to want money, so long as the monasteries 
were stored with treasure. 

In the year of our Lord 1137, in the beginning of Lent, 
the king crossed the sea. The earl, too, having tiioroughly 
sounded, and discovered the inclinations of such as he knew 
to be tenacious of their plighted oath, and arranged what he 
conceived proper to be done afterwards, himself embarked 
on Easter-day, and prosperously reached the continent Not 
long after, he had very nearly experienced the malignity of 
adverse fortune : for the king endeavoured to intercept him 
by treachery, at the instigation of one William de Ipres. 
The earl, however, informed of it by one of the accom- 
plices, avoided the snare prepared for him, and absented 
himself from the palace, whither he was repeatedly invited, 
for several days. The king, troubled at having succeeded 
so little by his artifices, and thinking to effect his design by 
cunning, endeavoured, by a serene countenance and unre- 
quired confession, to extenuate the enormity of his crime. 
He swore, in words framed at the earl's pleasure, never 
again to give countenance to such an outrage : and stUl more

to recoTer hiB good gracesy he oonfiimed his oath, bj Hugo, 
archbishop of Bouen, giving his hand to Bobert This be 
did, it is trae ; but he never bestowed his unreserved friend- 
ship on that man, of whose power he was ever apprehensive. 
Thos, in his presence he would pleasantly and a&bly call 
him ''earl:" when he was absent^ he would vilify him, and 
would deprive him, dandestinelj, of such portions of his 
estates as he was able. Bobert, too, artfully eluding his 
duplicity, disguised his feelings, and allowing the king to 
depart peaceably to his kingdom, continued in Normandy, 
intent on his own concerns. Wherefore while Stephen, 
perplexed by many commotions in England, and first at- 
tacking one, and then another, justly verified, what was 
said of Ishmael, '' That the hands of all were against him, 
and his hand against all," Bobert passed that whole year 
in Normandy in perfect quiet. The king pointedly, as it is 
reported, used' frequently to say of his rebellious subjects, 
** Since they have elected me king, why do they desert me ? 
By the birth of Grod, I will never he called a fidlen king !" 
Bobert, placed, as it were, on an eminence, watched the 
event of circumstances, and earnestly revolved how he 
might escape, before God and man, the imputation of falsi- 
fying the oath he had sworn to his sister. 

In the year of our Lord 1138, England was shaken with 
intestine commotions. For many persons, emboldened to 
ill^al acts, either by nobility of descent or by ambition, or 
rather by unbridled heat of youth, were not ashamed, some 
to demand castles, others estates, and indeed whatever came 
into their fancy, from the king. When he delayed complying 
with their requests, alleging the dismemberment of his king- 
dom, or that others would make similar claims, or were 
already in possession of them ; they, becoming enraged im- 
mediately, fortified th^ castles against him, and drove away 
large booties from his lands. Nor, indeed, was his spirit at 
all broken by the revolt of any, but attacking them suddenly 
in different places, he always concluded matters more to his 
own disadvantage than to theirs ; for, after many great but 
fruitless labours, he gained from them, by the grant of honours 
or castles, a peace, feigned only for a time. He created like- 
wise many earls,* where there had been none before, appro-

propriating to them possessioiis and rente, whicli rightfully 
belonged to the crown. They were the more greedy in ask- 
ing, and he the more profuse in giving, because a rumour 
was pervading England, that Robert earl of Gloucest^, who 
ivas in Normandy, would shortly espouse the cause of his 
sister, after first renouncing his fetdtyto the king. This 
report was in fact well-founded : for shortly after Pentecost, 
despatching some of his people to Stephen from Normandy, 
he, accordiqg to ancient usage, renounced his fealty and I 
friendship, and disannulled his homage ; assigning as a just 
reason for so doing, that the king had illegally aspired to the 
kingdom, and neglected his plighted faith to him, not to say 
absolutely belied it : and, moreover, that he himself had 
acted contrary to law ; who, after the oath sworn to his 
sister, had not blushed to do homage to another, during her 
Bfetime. Doubtless also his mind was biassed by the 
answers of many ecclesiaslics, whom he had consulted upon 
the subject ; who declared that he could by no means pass 
the present life without ignominy, nor deserve the happiness 
of the next, if he violated the oath made to paternal affection. 
In addition to this, he contemplated the tenor of the papal 
decree, commanding obedience to the oath taken in the pre- 
sence of his father : a copy of which decree I shall be care- 
ful to give in my next book. Robert, who had imbibed 
knowledge by a copious draught from the fount of science, 
was aware that these things would be of great advantage to 
him hereafter. But the king, indignant at the spirit of the 
earl, deprived him, as far as he was able, of all his possessions 
in England ; and levelled some of his castles to the ground. 
Bristol alone remained, which not only expelled the enemy, 
but even harassed the king by frequent incursions. But as 
it may suffice to have brought the first book of modem his- 
tory, from the return of the empress to her father after the 
death of her husband, to this period, I shall now begin the 
second, from the year in which this heroine came to England, 
to assert her right against Stephen.

BOOK n. 

In the year 1 139, the venom of malice, which had long been 
nurtured in the breast of Stephen, at length openlj burst 
forth. Rumours were prevalent in England, that earl 
Robert was on the verj eve of coming from Normandy with 
his sister : and, when under such an expectation, many persons 
revolted from the king, not only in inclination but in deed, 
he avenged himself for this injury, at the cost of numbers. 
He, also, contrary to the royal character, seized many at 
court, through mere suspicion of hostility to him, and obliged 
them to surrender their castles, and accede to any con- 
ditions he prescribed. There were, at that time, two veij 
powerful bishops, in England, Roger of Salisbury, and h» 
fraternal nephew, Alexander of Lincoln. Alexander had 
built the castle of Newark, as he said, for the defence and 
dignity of the bishopric. Roger, who wished to manifest his 
magni£cence by building, had erected extensive castles at 
Sherborne, and more especially at Devizes. At Malmesbuiy, 
even in the church-yard, and scarcely a stone's throw from the 
principal church, he had begun a castle. He had gotten into 
his custody the castle of Salisbury, which being royal pro- 
perty, he had obtained from king Henry, and surrounded 
with a wall. Some powerful laymen, hurt at the probability 
of being surpassed by the clergy, in extent of riches and 
magnitude of their towns, took offence at this, and fostered 
the latent wound of envy in their bosoms. Wherefore they 
poured forth their imagined grievances to the king ; observ- 
ing, that the bishops, regardless of their order, were mad for 
erecting castles : that none could doubt, but that they were 
designed for the overthrow of the king ; for, as soon as the 
empress should arrive, they would, induced doubtless by 
the recollection of her father's kindness to them, immedi- 
ately greet their sovereign with the surrender of their 
fortresses: that, therefore they ought to be prevented, 

poveriahed the crown by his liberalities to them. Henry the Second, hov- 
ever, on being firmly seated on the throne, recalled their grants of crovn 
lands, and expelled them the kingdom.

and compelled to give up their strong hol^ ; otherwise the 
king would repent too late, when he saw in the power of the 
enemy, that which, had he been wise, he might have applied 
to his own purpose. Such were the frequent insinuations ^f 
the nobility. The king, though far too partial to them, for 
some time pretended not to listen to what gratified his ear so 
much ; assuaging the bitterness of delay, either by his respect 
for the piety of tibe bishops, or, as I rather think, from appre- 
hension of the odium he might incur, by seizing their castles. 
Finally, he only postponed the execution of what the nobles 
had urged him to, tiU an opportunity presented itself for his 
purpose : which was as follows. 

A great assembly of the nobles being held at Oxford about 
the eighth before the kalends of July, the prelates above-men- 
tioned also repaired thither. The bishop of Salisbury set 
out on this expedition with great reluctance ; for I heard 
him speaking to the following purport: ''By my lady St 
Mary, I know not why, but my heart revolts at this journey : 
this I am sure of, that I shall be of much the same service at 
court, as a foal is in battle :" thus did his mind forbode 
future evils. Here, as though fortune would seem subser- 
vient to the king's wishes, a quarrel arose between the ser- 
vants of the bishops and those of Alan, earl of Brittany, 
about a right to quarters, which had a melancholy termina- 
tion ; as the bishop of Salisbury's retainers, then sitting at 
table, left their meal unfinished and rushed to the contest. 
At first, they contended with reproaches, afterwards with 
swords. The domestics of Alan were put to flight, and his 
nephew nearly killed : nor was the victory gained without 
bloodshed on the bishops' side ; for many were wounded, and 
one knight* even slam. The king, eagerly seizing the op- 
portunity, ordered the bishops to be convened by his old 
instigators, that they might make satisfaction to his court, as 
their people had infringed his peace : that this satisfaction 
should b^ the delivery of the keys of their castles, as pledges 
of their fidelity. Though prepared to make compensation, 
they hesitated at the surrender of their fortresses ; and in 

* The tenn " mQes " is veiy ambiguous : sometimes it is a knight ; 
sometimes a trooper ; sometimes a soldier generally. In later times it sig-^ 
niiied almost always a knight ; but in Malmesbury, it seems mostly a horse- 
man, probably of the higher order.

conseqaenoe^ lest thej should depart, be ordered them into 
close confinement. He therefore conducted bishop Reg^n*, 
unfettered, but the chancellor, the nephew, or as it was re- 
ported, more than the nephew,* of the bishop, in cfaaim^ to 
Devizes ; a castle, erected at great and almost incalciilable 
expense, not, as the prelate himself used to saj, for the oma- 
ment, but as the real fact is, to the detriment of the church. 
At the first summons, the castles of Salisbury, Sherborne, 
and Malmesbury were yielded to the king. Devizes also 
surrendered at the end of three days^ after the bishop had 
Toluntarily enjoined himself abstinence from all food, that, by 
his personal sufferings, he might subdue the spirit of the 
bishop of Ely, who had taken possession I of it. Nor did the 
bishop of Lincoln act more perseyeringly ; for he pmrchased 
his liberty by the surrender of his castles of Newai^ and 
Sleaford. 

This transaction of the king's gave rise to €he expression 
of many different opinions. Some observed, that the bbhops 
were justly dispossessed of their castles, as they had buOt 
them in opposition to the injunction of the canons : they 
ought to be glad preachers of peace, not builders of hofoses 
which might be a refuge for the contrivers of eviL Such 
was the doctrine enforced with ampler reasons and dtscoorses^ 
by Hugo, archbishop of Rouen : as far as his eloquence ex- 
tended, the strenuous champion of the king. Others took 
the opposite side of the question. This party was espous e d 
by Heniy, bishop of Winchester, legate of England from Uie 
papal see, and brother to king Stephen, as I have said befbre, 
whom no fraternal affection, no fear of danger, could torn 
aside from the path of truth. He spake to this effect : ** IT 
the bishops had in anything overpassed the bounds of josfioe, 
the judging them did not pertain to the king, but to the ec* 
clesiastical canons : that they ought not to be deprived of 
any pa<)session but by a public and ecclesiastical council : 
that the king had not acted from zealous regard to right, but

with a view to his own advantage ; as he had not restored 
the castles to the churches, at whose expense, and on whose 
land they were hoilt^ hut had delivered them to la jmen, and 
those bj no means of religious character." Though the le- 
gate made these declarations not onlj privatelj, but publicly 
also before the king, and urged him to the liberation and 
restitution of the bishops, yet,' being entirely disregarded, he 
lost his labour. In consequence, deeming it proper to resort 
to cancmical power, he summoned his brother, without delay, 
to be present at a council he intended to hold at Winchester, 
on the fourth before the kalends of September. 

On the appointed day, almost all the bishops of England, 
with Theobald, archbishop of Canterbury, who had succeeded 
William^ came to Winchester. Thurstan, archbishop of York, 
excused himself, on account of the malady with which he 
was afflicted ; for he was so enfeebled, as to be hardly able 
to guide his steps : the others apologized for their absence, 
by letter, on account of the war. The bull of pope Innocent 
was first read in the council, whereby, even from the kalends 
of March, if I rightly remember, he had enjoined the ad- 
ministration of his anxious chaige to the lord bishop of Win- 
chester, as legate in England. This was received with much 
good-will, as the bishop had shown his forbearance by the 
lapse of time, and had not proclaimed himself legate with 
precipitate vanity. Next followed, in the council, his ad- 
dress, in the Latin tongue, directed to the learned, on the 
disgraceful detention of the bishops : ^^ of whom the bishop 
of Salisbury had been seized in a chamber of the palace, 
Lincoln in his lodgings, and Ely, fearing a similar treatment, 
had escaped the calamity by a hasty retreat to Devizes :" 
he observed, '^ that it was a dreadful crime, that the king 
should be so led away by sinister persons, as to have ordered 
violent hands to be laid on his subjects, more especially bi- 
shops, in the security of his' court : that, to the king's dis- 
grace was to be added the offence against God, in despoiling 
the churches of their possessions, under pretext of the crimi- 
nality of the prelates : that, the king's outrage against the 
law of God, was matter of such pain to him, that he had 
rather himself suffer grievous injury, both in person and 
property, than have the episcopal dignity so basely humili- 
ated ; moreover, that the king^ being repeatedly admonished 



502 HOBSEN HISTOST. [b.u. 

to amend his fault, had, at kst, not refused that the ooixiidl 
should be summoned : that therefore, the archbishop and the 
rest should deliberate what was proper to be done ; and he 
would not be wanting to execute the sentence of the oouneil, 
either through regard to the friendship of the king, who was 
his brother, or loss of property, or even danger of life.** 

When he had gradually expatiated on these mattersy the 
king, not distrusting his cause, sent certain * earls into the 
council to demand wherefore he was summoned. The legate 
briefly replied, ^'that, when he recollected he was in subjec- 
tion to the faith of Christ, he ought not to be displeased, if) 
when guilty of a crime, such as the present age had never 
witnessed, he was required, by the ministers of Christy to 
make satisfaction : that it was the act of heathen nations to 
imprison bishops, and divest th^n of their possessions : that 
they should teU his brother, therefore, that if he would deign 
a patient assent to his advice, he would give him such, by 
the authority of God, as neither the church of Rome, nor the 
French king's court, nor even earl Theobald, their common 
brother, a man of surpassing sense and piety, could reason- 
ably oppose ; but such as they ought favourably to embrace : 
that, at present, the king would act advisedly, if be would 
either account for his conduct, or submit to canonical judg- 
ment : it was, moreover, a debt he owed, to favour the 
church, by whose fostering care, not by military force, he 
had been promoted to the kingdom." The earls retiring lifter 
this speech, returned shortly with an answer prepared. They 
were accompanied by one Alberic de Yer, a man deeply 
versed in legal affairs. He related the king's answer, and 
aggravated as much as possible the case of bbhop Roger, for 
bishop Alexander had departed ; but this he did with mode- 
ration, and without using opprobrious language, though some 
of the earls, standing by, repeatedly interrupted his harangue 
by casting reproaches on the bishop. 

The sum of what Alberic had to allege, was as foQows : 
'^ That bishop Roger had greatly injured king Stephen ; that 
he seldom cameJg.jCourt, but his people, presuming on his 
power, excifed tumults; that they had, fi^uently at other

places and yery lately at Oxford, attacked the attendants, 
and even the very nephew of earl Alan, as well as the ser- 
vants of Hervey de Lyons, a man of such high nobility, and 
80 extremely haughty, that he had never deigned to visit 
JSngland though king Henry had invited him ; that the in- 
jury, therefore, of such violence having been offered him, 
doubly recoiled on king Stephen, through respect to whom 
he had come hither; Uutt the bishop of linooln had been 
the author of the tumult excited by his followers from an- 
cient enmity to Alan ; that the bishop of Salisbury secretly 
favoured the king's enemies, though he disguised his subtlety 
for the moment; that the king had discovered this beyond 
all doubt, £rom many circumstances, more especially, how- 
ever, from the said bishop's having refused permission to 
Boger de Mortimer with itte king's soldiers whom he was 
conducting, when under the greatest apprehensions from the • 
garrison of Bristol, to continue even a single night at 
Malmesbury ; that it was in eveiy person's mouth, that, as 
80on as the empress should arrive, he would join her party, 
with his nephews and their castles; that Roger, in conse- 
quence, was made captive, not as a bishop but as the king's 
servant who had administered his affairs and received lus 
wages ; that the king had not taken their castles by violence, 
but that both bishops had surrendered them voluntarily to 
escape the punishment due to the disturbance they had ex- 
cited in the court; that the king had found some trifling 
sums of money in the castles which must lawfuUy belong to 
himself, as bishop Roger had collected it £rom the revenues 
of the exchequer in tibe times of his unde and predecessor 
king Henry; that the bishop had readily relinquished this 
money as well as the castles through consciousness of his 
offences, of which the king did not want for witnesses; 
that, therefore, he was willing that the conditions entered 
into by himself and the bishops should remain in force." 

It was rejoined by bishop Roger, in opposition to the 
speech of Alberic, that he had never been the minister of 
king Stephen ; nor had he received his wages. This spirited 
man, too, who blushed at being cast down by adversity, 
threatened, that if he could not have justice for the property 
which had been wrested from him, in that council, he would 
seek it in the audience of a higher court. The legate 



SM UODVBM HI8I0BT. [a.B. 

mlldlj, u usual, obeezred that every aU^atkm against die 
bishops ought to be made and the truth of it inquired into 
in an eodenastical courts before passing sentence, contnsj 
to the canons, on innocent persons; that the king ought 
therefore to do as was incumbent in civil courts, that is, 
re-invest the bishops with their own ^rcfperty, otherwise, 
being disseized, by ike hiw of nations, thej will not plead. 

Many arguments of this kind being used on boUi sidee^ 
the cause, at the king's request, was adjourned to the next 
daj ; then, cm the morrow, proloi^ed still a daj fiurther tilL 
the arrival of the archbishop of Bwien. 

When he came, while all were anxious to hear what he 
had to allege, he said he was willing to allow the bishops 
their castles if they could prove by the canons tiiat they 
ought justly to possess them ; but as they were not able to do 
•this it was the height of impudence to contend against the 
canons. " And admitting," said he, ** that it be just Sor 
them to possess castles, yet most assuredly, as the times are 
eventftil, all chiefe, after the custom of other nations, ought 
to deliver up the keys of their fortifications to the will of the 
king, who is bound to wage war for the common security.* 
Thus the whole plea of the bishops was shaken : for, either 
according to the decrees of the canons, it was unjust for 
them to have castles, or, if that were allowed by the king^s 
indulgence, they ought to yield to the emergency of the times^ 
and give up the keys. 

To this, the aforesaid pleader Alberic added that it had 
been signified to the king that the bbhops muttered among 
themselves, and had even made preparation for some of their 
party to proceed to Rome against him. ^^ And this,** said he, 
" the king advises that none of you presume to do ; for if any 
person shall go from England to any place, in opposition to 
him and to the dignity of his kingdom, perhaps his return 
may not be so easy. Moreover, he, as he sees himself 
aggrieved, of his own accord summons you to Bome.* When 
the king had sent such a message, partly advising and partly 
threatening, it was perceived what was his design. In con- 
sequence the council broke up, as he would not submit to 
canonical censure ; and the bishops deemed it unadvisable to 
enforce it against him for two reasons : first, because it was 
a rash act to excommunicate the king without the knowledge

of the pope ; seoondlj, because they understood, or some of 
them eTea saw, that swords were unsheathed around them. 
The contention was no longer of mere words, but nearly for 
life and for blood. The legate and the archbishop stlU, how- 
ever, were anziouslj observant of their duly. They humbly 
prostrated themselves before the king in his chamber, en- 
treating him to take pily on the church, and to consider his 
soul and his reputation, and that he would not suffer a schism 
to be made between the empire and the priesthood. Although 
lie in some measure removed the odium of his former con- 
duct, by condescendingly rising to them, yet, prevented 
by ill advice, he carried none of his Mr promises into 
effect 

The council broke up on the kalends of September ; and 
on the day previous to the kalends of October, earl Robert, 
having at length surmounted every cause of delay, arrived 
with the empress his sister in England, relying on the pro- 
tection of God and the observance of Ids lawful oath ; but 
with a much smaller military force than any other person 
would have required for so perilous an enterprise; for he 
had not with him, at that time, more than one hundred and 
forty horsemen. My assertion is supported by persons of 
veracity ; and did it not look like flattery, I would say that 
he was not inferior to Julius Csesar, at least in resolution, 
whom Livy* relates to have had but five cohorts when he 
began the dvil war, with which he attacked the world; 
though the comparison between Julius and Robert is invidi- 
ous. For Julius, an alien to the true faith, reposed his hope 
on his good fortune, as he used to say, and the valour of his 
l^ons ; Robert, celebrated for Christian pietv, relied only on 
the assistance of the Holy Spirit and the lady St. Mary. The 
former had partisans in Gaul, in part of Germany, and Brit- 
tany, and had attached to him by means of presents all the 
Roman people with the exception of the senate ; the latter, 
bating a very few who regarded their plighted oath, found 
the nobility in England either opposing or aflbrding him no 
assistance. He limded, then, at Arundel, and for a time de- 
livered his sister into the safe keeping, as he supposed, of 
her mother-in-law, whom Henry, as I have before related, 

* It would seem from this panage that he had seen lArj in a more com- 
plete itate thaa it exiati at preaent. 



506 KODERK mSTOHT. lB.it. 

had taken to his bed on the death of the empress's mother. 
Himself proceeded through the hostile country to Bristol, ac- 
companied, as I have heard, by scarcely twelve horsemen, 
and was joined in the midst of his journey by Brian Fits- 
Count of Wallingford. Nor was it long ere he learned that 
his ^ter had quitted Arundel ; for her mother-in-law, 
through female inconstancy, had broken the faith she had 
repeatedly pledged by messages sent into Normandy. The 
earl, therefore, committed the empress to Henry bishop of 
Winchester and Waleran earl of Mellent for safe conduct, a 
favour never denied to the most inveterate enemy by honour- 
able soldiers. Waleran, indeed, declined going farther than 
Calne, but the bishop continued his route. The earl, there- 
fore, quickly collecting his troops, came to the boundary 
appointed by the king, and placed his sister in safe quarters 
at Bristol. She was afterwards received into Gloucester by 
Milo, who held the castle of that city under the earl in the 
time of king Henry, doing him homage and swearing fidelity 
to him ; for this is the chief city of his county. 

On the nones of October one Robert Fitz- Hubert, a savage 
barbarian, by night clandestinely entering the castle of 
Malmesbury, which bishop Rochester had inauspiciously 
founded, and burning the town, boasted of the deed, as though 
he had gained a great triumph. But, within a fortnight, his 
joy was at an end, being put to flight by the king. Stephen, 
in the meantime, commanded possession to be kept of the 
castle, until, on the restoration of peace, it might be destroyed. 
The king, moreover, before he came to Malmesbury, had 
occupied, and placed a garrison in a small fortress called 
Ccrney, belonging to the aforesaid Milo. In consequence, 
thinking he should be equally successful elsewhere, as at that 
place and at Malmesbury, he assailed a castle called Trow- 
bridge, belonging to Humphrey de Bohun, who was of the 
empress's party, but he departed without success. 

The whole country then around Gloucester to the extrenuty 
of Wales, partly by force, and partly by favour, in the course 
of the remaining months of that year, gradually espoused the 
party of their sovereign the empress. The owners of certain 
castles, securing themselves within their fastnesses, waited 
the issue of events. The city of Hereford was taken without 
difficulty ; and a few soldiers, who determined on resistance,

had thrown themselyes into the castle, were blocked up. 
The king drew nigh, if possible, to devise means for their 
assistance ; but frustrated in his wishes, he retired with dis- 
grace. He also approached Bristol, and going beyond it, 
bnmt the neighbourhood around Dunstore, leaving nothing, 
as far as he was able, which could minister food to his ene- 
mies, or advantage to any one. 

On the third before the ides of December, Boger bishop of 
Salisbury, by the kindness of death, escaped the quartan 
ague which had long afflicted him. They assert that his 
sickness was brought upon him through grief at the severe 
and repeated injuries he had received from king Stephen. 
To me it appears, that GUkI exhibited him to the wealthy as 
an example of the mutability of fortune, in order that they 
should not trust in uncertain riches, which, as the apostle 
says, ^^ while some have coveted, concerning faith have made 
shipwreck.^ He first ingratiated himself with prince Henry, 
who became afterwards king, by his prudence in the manage- 
ment of domestic matters, and by restraining the excesses of 
his household. For, before his accession, Henry had been 
careful and economical in his expenses, compelled thereto by 
the scantiness of his resources, and the illiberal treatment of 
his brothers, William and Robert. Knowing his disposition 
this way, Roger had deserved so well of him in his time of 
need, that, when he came to the throne, he denied him 
scarcely any thing he thought proper to ask ; gave him 
estates, churches, prebends, entire abbeys of monks, and, 
lastly, committed even the kingdom to his fidelity : made him 
chancellor, in the beginning of his reign, and not long after, 
bishop of Salisbury. Roger, therefore decided causes ; he 
regulated the expenditure ; he had charge of the treasury. 
Such were his occupations when the king was in England : 
such, without associate or inspector, when he resided in Nor- 
mandy ; which took place repeatedly, and for a long time 
together. And not only the king, but the nobility, even 
those who were secretly stung with envy at his good fortune, 
and more especially the ministers and debtors of the king, 
gave him almost whatever he could fancy. Was there any 
^ing contiguous to his property which might be advan- 
tageous to him, he would directly extort it, either by entreaty 
or purchase ; or, if that failed, by force. With unrivalled 



508 VODSRN BISTORT. (a.rL 

magnificence in their construction^ as our times may recollect^ 
he erected splendid mansions on all his estates ; in mec^ 
n^ i^into^ining which, the labour of his successors shall toil in 
vain. His cathedral he dignified to the utmost with matdi* 
less ornaments and buildings on which no expense was spared. 
It was truly wonderful to behold in this man, what abundant 
power attended him in every kind of digni^, and flowed as 
it were to his hand. How great was the glory,, indeed, what 
could exceed it, that he should have made his two nephews^ 
by virtue of his education, men of noted learning and indus- 
try, bishops ; and, not of mean sees ; but of Lincoln and 
Ely, than wbich, I know not whether there be more opulent 
in England ? He was sensible of his power, and, sOToewhoC 
more harshly than became such a character, abused the 
favours of heaven. Lastly, as a certain poet observes (si a 
rich man,* 

^ He buildB, deBtroys, and changes aquaie £at ronnd,** 

so Roger attempted to turn abbeys into bishoprics, and 
bishoprics into abbeys. The most ancient monasteries of 
Malmesbury and Abbotsbury, he annexed, as fiu* as he was 
able, to his see. He changed the priory of Sherborne, which 
is subject to the bishop of Salisbury, into an abbey ; and the 
abbey of Hortun was forthwith dissolved and united to it. 
These events took place in the time of king Heniy, under 
whom, as I have observed, his prosperity reached its senith : 
for under Stephen, as I have before rdated, it began to de- 
cline ; except that in the beginning of his reign, he obtained 
for one of his nephews, the chancellorship ; for the other the 
office of treasurer ; and for himself the town of Malmes- 
bury ; the king repeating often to his companions, *' By the 
birth of God, I would give him half England, if he asked Sot 
it : till the time be ripe, he shall tire of asking, ere I tire of 
giving." But fortune, who, in former times, had flattered 
him so long and so transcendently, at last crudly pierced him 
with scorpion-sting. Such was that instance, when he saw 
those whom he dearly regarded, wounded; and his most 
favoured knight killed before his face ; the next day, him- 
self, and, as I said before, his nephews, very powerful bishops, 
the one compelled to fly, the other detained, and the third» a

jonng man to whom he was greMj attached, bound with 
chains : on the surrender of his castles, his treasures pillaged, 
and himself afWwards, in the council, loaded with the most 
disgraceful reproaches. Finally, as he was nearlj breathing 
his latest sigh, at Salisbury, the residue of his money and 
ntensils, which he had placed upon the altar for the purpose 
of completing the church, was carried off against his wilL 
The height of his calamity, was, I think, a circumstance 
which eyen I cannot help conmiiserating ; that, though he 
appeared wretched to many, yet there were very few who 
pitied him: so much envy and hatred had his excessive 
power drawn on him, and undeservedly, too^ from some of 
those very persons whom he had advanced to honour. 

In the year of the Incarnate Word 1140, the monks of 
those abbeys which Roger had unjustifiably usurped, waiting 
on the king, were permitted to ei^oy their ancient privileges, 
and abbats, as formerly. John, a monk of that place, a man 
highly celebrated for the affability of his manners and the 
libendity of his mind, was elected abbat of Mahnesbury by 
the monks, according to the tenor of the privilege which St. 
Aldhelm had obtained from pope Sergius four hundred and 
sixty-six years before, and had caused to be confirmed by 
the kings, Ina of the West Saxons, and Ethelred of the Mer^ 
cians. The legate approved the claim, but disapproved of the 
person : for he could not be induced to believe that the king 
had consented to the election but by a gift in money. And, 
indeed, a small sum had been promised, on the score of libera- 
ting the church, not for the election of the person. Where- 
fore John, though taken off by a premature death within the 
year, still left a lasting and laudable memory of himself to 
all succeeding ages. For no monk of that place, I confess 
the truth, would have pursued a task of such difficulty, had 
not John begun it. Wherefore let his successors be praised, 
if they shall preserve the liberty of that church ; he certainly 
rescued it from thraldom. 

The whole of this year was embittered by the horrors of 
war. There were many castles throughout England, each 
defending their neighbourhood, but, more properly speaking, 
laying it wa^te. The garrisons drove off from the fields, 
both sheep uid cattle, nor d4d they abstain either from 
churches or church-yards. Seizing such of the country

▼ayassotin * as were rq>uted to be possessed of moDej^ thef 
compelled them, hj extreme torture, to promise whatever 
thej thought fit. Plundering the houses of the wretched 
husbandmen, even to their very beds, thej cast them into 
prison ; nor did they" liberate them, but on their giving every 
thing they possessed or could by any means scrape together, 
for their release. Many calmly expired in the midst of 
torments inflicted to compel them to ransom themselves^ 
bewailing, which was all they could do, their miseries to 
God. And, indeed, at the instance of the earl, the legate, 
with the bishops, repeatedly excommunicated all violators 
of church-yards and plunderers of churches, and those who 
laid violent hands on men in holy or monastic orders^ or 
their servants : but this his attention profited but little. It 
was distressing, therefore, to see England, <Hice the fondest 
cherisher of peace and the single receptacle of tranquillitf , 
reduced to such a pitch of misery, that, not even the bishops, 
nor monks, could pass in safety from one town to another. 
Under king Henry, many foreigners, who had been driven 
from home by the commotions of their native land, were 
accustomed to resort to England, and rest in quiet under his 
fostering protection : in Stephen's time, numbers of free- 
booters from Flanders and Brittany flocked to England, 
in expectation of rich pillage. Meanwhile, the earl of 
Gloucester conducted himself with caution, and his most 
earnest endeavours were directed to gaining conquests with 
the smaller loss to his adherents. Such of the English 
nobility as he could not prevail upon to regard the 
obligation of their oath, he held it sufficient if he could 
so restrain, that, if they did not assist, they would not 
injure the cause : being willing, according to the saying 
of the comic writer, " To do what he could, when he could 
not do what he would." But when he saw the opportunity 
present itself, he strenuously performed the duty both of 
soldier and of general ; more especially, he valiantly sub- 
dued those strong holds, which were of signal detriment to 
the cause he had espoused ; that is to say, Harpetrey, which 
king Stephen had taken from certain soldiers of the eari 
before he came to England, and many others ; Sudley,

Cemejy which the king had garrisoned, as I haye said ; and 
the castle which Stephen had fortified over against Walling* 
ford, he levelled to the ground. He also^ in these difficiSt 
times, created his brother Rainald, earl of ComwalL Nor 
indeed did the king show less spirit in performing the daties 
of his station ; for he cnnitted no occasion of repeatedly 
beating o£f his adversaries, and defending his own posses- 
sions. But he failed of success, and all tidings declined, for 
lack of justice. Dearth of provisions, too, increased by 
d^rees, and the scarcity of good money was so great, from 
its being counterfeited, that, sometimes out of ten or more 
shillings, hardly a dozen pence would be received. The king 
himself was reported to have ordered the weight of the 
penny, as established in king Henry's time, to be reduced, 
because, having exhausted the vast treasures of his prede- 
cessor, he was unable to provide for the expense of so many 
soldiers. All things, then, became venal in England ; and 
churches and abbeys were no longer secretly, but even 
publicly exposed to sale. 

During this year, in Lent, on the thirteenth before the 
kalends of AprD, at the ninth hour of the fourth day of the 
week, there was an eclipse, throughout England, as I have 
beard. With us, indeed, and with all our neighbours, the 
obscuration of the sun was so remarkable, tiiat persons 
sitting at table, as it then happened almost every where, 
for it was Lent, at first feared that chaos was come again : 
afterwards learning its cause, they went out, and beheld the 
stars around the sun. It was thought and said by many, 
not untruly, that the king would not continue a year in the 
government. 

Li the following week, that is, during the time of the 
Passion, on the seventh before the kalends of April, the 
forementioned barbarian, Robert Fitz-Hubert, a character 
well calculated for the stratagems of war, surprised the 
castle of Devizes : * a man, by far the most cruel of any 
within the circle of this age's memory : blasphemous, also^ 
towards Gk)d. He used voluntarily to boast of having been 
present at a place where twenty-four monks were burnt, 
together with the church, declaring, that he too would

frequently do the Hke in EDgbind, and grieve Crod, bj the 
plunder of the church of Wilton ; and the destruction of 
Malmesburj, with the slaughter of all its monks : that he 
would return them this good office, because they had ailtnitM 
the king, to his disadvantage : fbr of this be aocoaed them, 
though without foundation. I myself have heard, when, at 
any time, which was extremely rare indeed, he liberated his 
captives without torture, and th^ thanked him for it, on the 
part of God, I have heard him, I say, reply ; "neyer let 
Grod owe me any thanks." He used to expose his prisoners, 
naked and rubbed with honey, to the burning heat of the 
sun ; thereby exciting flies, and other insects of that kind, 
to sting them. But, having now got possession of Devises, 
he hesitated not to boast, that, he should gain, by means of 
this castle, the whole district firom Winchester to London ; 
and that he would send to Flanders for soldiers to defend 
him. While meditating, however, such a scheme, divine 
vengeance overtook him through the agency of one John 
Fitz-Gilbert, a man of suprising subtlety, who had a castle 
at Marlborough. For being thrown into chains by faim, 
because he refused to surrender Devizes to his sovereign, 
the empress, he was hanged, like a common thief. Wonderful 
was the judgment of God on this sacrilegious wretch, that 
he should meet with such an ignominious end, not firom die 
king, to whom he was inimical, but from the very persons 
he appeared to favour. The authors of his death ought 
worthily to be extolled, for having freed the country £rom 
such a pest, and justiiy despatched an intestine enemy. 

In the same year, during Pentecost, the king resided at 
London, in the Tower, attended only by the bishop of Sees, 
for the others disdained, or feared, to come thither. Some 
little time after, by the mediation of the legate, a conference 
was appointed between the empress and the king, that, if 
possible, by the inspiration of Grod, peace might be restored. 
To this conference, near Bath, were sent oa the part of the 
empress, her brother Robert, and others of her Mends : on 
the king's, the legate, the archbishop, and also the queen. 
But they wasted words and time, to no purpose, and departed 
without being able to conclude a peace. Nor was the ground 
of separation equal on both sides, as the empress, mcMre 
inclined to justice, had declared, that she was not averse to

the decimoii of the church : bat the king most candotialj 
avoided this ; fondly trusting to the counsels of those persons 
who loved nothing less than peace, so long as thej could 
make their ascendency over him ani^er their own purposes. 
In the latter end of September, the legate^ who knew tiiat it 
was the eqpecial duty of his office to restore peace, under- 
taking the toil of a foreign voyage for its accomplishment, 
hastened to sail over to France. Here, a long and anxious 
discussion, for tranquillizing England, taking place, between 
the king of France, earl l^eobi^ and many of the clergy, 
he returned, nearly at the end of November, bringing back 
counsels wholesome for the country, could they have been 
canied into effect. And indeed the empress and the earl 
assented to them lamiediately, but the king delayed firom day 
to day, and finally r^ected them altogetliMBr. Upon this, at 
last, the legate discontinued his exertions, waiting, like the 
resi for the issue of events : for what avails it to swim 
against the stream ? and, as some one observes, " To seek 
odium only by <me's labours is the height of madness."

I KOW attempt to give a clue to the mazy labyrinth of events 
and transactions which occurred in England, during the year 
1141,* lest posterity, through my neglect, should be unac*

the earl of Chester,* and of his brother; of whom the eai^ 
long since^ in the time of king Henry; had been married to 
the daughter of the earl of Gloucester. In the mean whik^ 
the citizens of lincoln, who wished to acquire great favoiir 
with the king, certified him bj a message^ when resident in 
London, that the two brothers had taken up their abode in 
aecuiitj, in the castle of that cily: and that, suspecting 
nothing less than the arrival of the king, thej might be Teiy 
easily surprised, while themselyes would provide that he 
should get possession of the castle as secretlj as poasibla 
As Stephen never wished to neglect any opportunity of aug- 
menting his power, he ghidly repaired thither. In cons^ 
quence, the brothers were surprised and besieged, even in 
^e Christmas holidays. This step appeared ui^ostifiable to 
jollany, because, as I have observed, he had left them before 
the festival, without any suspicion of enmily; nor had he^ 
even now, after ancient usage, abjured his ftiendship with 
them, which they call ^ defying.** However, the earl of 
Chester, though surrounded with imminent dangers^ adroitly 
escaped from the castle. By what management this was 
accomplished I know not ; whether through consent of some 
of the besiegers, or whether, because valour, when taken bj 
surprise, frequently tries variety of methods, and often dis- 
covers a remedy for its emeigencies. Not content with his 
own escape, he earnestly cast about, how to devise the 
safety of his brother and of his wife, whom he had left in 
the fortress. The more prudent mode seemed to be, to 
request assistance &om his father-in-law, although he had 
long since offended him on many accounts, but principally 
because he appeared staunch to neither party. He sent 
messengers, therefore, promising eternal fidelity to the em- 
press, il^ induced more by affectionate regard than any desert 
of his, he would rescue those firom danger, who were already 
in the very jaws of captivity. 

Unable to endure this indignity, the earl of Gloucester 
readily assented. Weary of delay, too, as the fiiirest countxy 
was harassed with intestine rapine and slaughter, for the sake 
of two persons, he preferred bringing the matter to an issue 
at once, would Gt>d permit He hoped, also, for the Divine

asfflstance on his tmdertakizigy as the king had molested his 
son-in-laWy without anj fault on his part; was at that 
moment besieging his daughter; and had castellated the 
church of the holj mother of God in linooln. How much 
<night these things to weigh in the mind of a prince ? Would 
it not be better to die, and fall with honour, than endure so 
marked a disgrace? For the sake then of avenging God, 
and his sister, and liberating his relations, he entered on this 
perilous undertaking. The supporters of his partj readily 
accompanied him ; the m^or part of whom being deprived 
of their inheritances, were instigated to hostilitj hj rage at 
their losses, and the consciousness of their valour. However, 
daring the whole extended march, from Gloucester to Lin- 
coln, he studiously concealed his intention, leaving all the 
army, with the exception of a very few, in suspense, by his 
mysterious conduct 

At length, on the day of the Purification of the blessed 
Mary, they arrived at the river flowing between the two 
armies, called the Trent, which, from its springs, together 
with floods of rain, had risen so high, that it could not pos- 
sibly be forded. Here, at last^ disdosing his intention to his 
son-in-law, who had joined him with a strong force, and* to 
those he had brought with him, he added, that^ " He had 
long since made up his mind, never to be induced to fly, be 
the emergency what it might; if they could not conquer, 
they must die or be taken.** All encouraged him to hope the 
best ; and, wonderful to hear, though on the eve of hazard- 
ing a battle, he swam over the rapid river I have mentioned, 
with the whole of his party. So great was the earl's ardour 
to put an end to calamity, that he preferred risking extre- 
mities to prolonging the sufierings of the country. The 
king, too, with many earls, and an active body of cavalry, 
abandoning the siege, courageously presented himself for bat- 
tler The royalists b^an the prelude to the fight, which they 
call the ^ joust,"* as they were skiUed in that exercise : but 
when they saw that the consular party, if they may be so 
called, did not attack from a distance with lances, but at 
close quarters with swords, and broke the king's ranks with 
violent and determined onset, the earls, to a man, for six of

them had entered the conflict, together with the king, eon- 
suited their safety by flight A few barons, of Liadable 
fidelity and valonr, who would not desert him, even in his 
necessity, were made captive. The king, though he by no 
means wanted spirit to defend himself, being at last attacked 
on every side by the earl of Gloucester's soldiers, fell to the 
ground by a blow from a stone ; but who was the autiior of 
this deed is uncertain. Thus, when all around him were 
either taken or dispersed, he waa compelled to yield to cir- 
cumstances and become a captive. On which the truly noble 
earl of Gloucester ccMnmanded the king to be preserved un- 
injured, not suffering him to be molested even wi& a 
reproach ; and the person, whom he had just before fiercely 
attacked when dignified with the sovereignty, he now calmly 
protected when subdued : that the tumults of anger and of 
joy being quieted, he might show kindness to his relation, 
and respect the dignity of the diadem in the captive. The 
citizens of Lincoln were slaughtered on all sides by the just 
indignation of the victors, and without commiseration on the 
part of the conquered, as they had been the origin and 
fomenters of this calamity. 

The king, according to the custom of such as are called 
captives, was presented to the empress, at Gloucester, by her 
brother, and afterwards conducted to BristoL Here, at first, 
he was kept with eveiy mark of honour, except the liberty 
of going at large : but in succeeding time, through the pre- 
sumption of certain persons, who said openly and contu- 
meliously, that it did not behove the earl to treat the king 
otherwise than they chose ; and also, because it was reported, 
that having either eluded or bribed his keepers, he had been 
found, more than once, beyond the appointed limits, more 
especially in the night-time, he was confined with fetters. 

In the meanwhile, both the empress and the earl dealt by 
messengers with the legate his brother, that he should forth- 
with receive her into the church,* and to the kingdom, as 
the daughter of king Henry, to whom all England and Nor- 
mandy had sworn allegiance. This year, the first Sunday 
in Lent happened on the fourteenth before the kalends of 
March. By means of negotiators on either side, the bnsiDess 
was so far forwarded, that they agreed to meet in conference, 

* That is, as appears after, to acknowledge her publicly as i

on an open plain on this side of Winchester. They assembled, 
therefore, on the third Sunday in Lent, a day dark and rainy, 
as though the fates would portend a woeful change in this 
affair. The empress swore^ and pledged her faith to the bi- 
shop, that all matters of importance in England, and especi- 
ally the bestowing of bishoprics and abbeys, should await his 
decision, if he, with the holy church, would receive her as 
sovereign, and observe perpetual fidelity towards her. Her 
brother, Robert, earl of Gloucester, swore as she did, and 
pledged his faith for her, as did also Brian Fitz-count, lord 
Marcher* of WaUingford, and Milo of Gloucester, aflterwards 
earl of Hereford, with some others. Nor did the bishop 
hesitate to receive the empress as sovereign of England, an^ 
together with certain of his party, to pledge his faith, that so 
long as she did not infringe the covenant, he would observe 
his fidelity to her. On the morrow, whidi was the fifth be- 
fore the nones of March, a splendid procession being formed, 
she was received in the cathedral of Winchester ; the bishop- 
legate conducting her on the right side, and Bernard, bishop 
of St. David's, on the left. There were present also, Alex- 
ander, bishop of Lincoln, Bobert of Hereford, Nigel of Ely, 
Robert of Bath : the abbats, Ligulf of Abingdon, Edward of 
Reading, Peter of Mahnesbury, Gilbert of Gloucester, Roger 
of Tewkesbury, and some others. Li a few days, Theobald, 
archbishop of Canterbury, came to the empress at Winches- 
ter, by invitation of the legate : but he deferred promising 
fidelity to her, deeming it breath his reputation and charac- 
ter to change sides, till he had consulted the king. Li con- 
sequence, he, and many other prelates, with some few of the 
laity, were allowed to visit Stephen and converse with him : 
anc^ graciously obtaining leave to submit to the exigency of 
the times, they embraced the sentiments of the legate. The 
empress passed Easter, which happened on the third before 
4he kalends of April, at Oxford ; the rest returned to their 
respective homes. 

On the day after the octaves of Easter, a council began, 

* Marchio : thif latterl j ugnified maiquia in the seiue we now lue it ; 
but in Malmesbiuy's time, and long after, it denoted a guardian of the 
borden : hence the lords marchera on the confines of Scotland and Wales ; 
though it does not appear reiy clearly how this should applj to Wal- 
iingford, uxilesB it was is his place of birth.

with great parade, at Winchester, consisting of Theobalc^ 
archbishop of Canterburj, all the bishops of England, and 
manj abbats : the legate presiding. Such as were absent, 
accounted for it bj messengers and letters. As I was pre* 
sent at the holding of this council, I will not deny posterity 
the truth of every circumstance ; for I perfectly remember 
it On the same day, after the letters were read by wfaidi 
some excused their absence^ the legate called the bbhops 
apart, and discoursed with them in secret of his design ; then 
the abbats, and, lastly, the archdeacons were summoned. Of 
his intention nothing transpired publicly, though what was 
to be done engrossed the minds and conversation of alL 
^ On the third day of the week, the speech of the legate ran 
^yC nearly to this efliect : " That, by the condescension of the 
pope, he acted as his vicegerent in England : wherefore, by 
his authority, the clergy of England were assembled at this 
council to deliberate on the peace of the country, which wis 
exposed to imminent danger : that, in the time of king Hen- 
ry, his uncle, England had been the peculiar abode of peace; 
so that by the activity, and spirit^ and care of that most 
excellent man, not only the natives, of whatever power or 
dignity, dared make no disturbance ; but, by his example^ 
each neighbouring king and prince, also^ yielded to peaoe^ 
and either invited, or compelled, his subjects to do the like : 
moreover, that this king, some years before his death, had 
caused the whole realm of England, as well as the duchy of 
Normandy, to be engaged, by the oaths of all the bishops and 
barons, to his daughter, late the empress, who was his only 
surviving issue by his former consort, if he should fidl m 
male offspring by the wife he had espoused from Lorraine : 
and adverse fortune," said he, ^' was envious of my most ex- 
cellent uncle, and suffered him to die in Normandy without 
male issue. Therefore, as it seemed long to wait for a sove- 
reign who delayed coming to England, for she resided in 
Normandy, we provided for the peace of the country, and my 
brother was allowed to reign. And although I gave myself 
as surety between him and Grod, that he would honour and 
advance the holy church, and uphold good, but abrogate evil, 
laws ; yet it grieves me to remember, shames me to say, 
how he conducted himself in the kingdom : how justice 
ceased to be exerted against the daring ; how all jpeaoe was 



AJK 1141.1 ICATILDA ELECTBD SOVSBEIGir. 519 

minihilated, almost within the year : the bishops made cap- 
tive, and compelled to give up tiieir possessions ; the abbeys 
sold ; the churches robbed of their treasures ; the counsels 
of the abandoned regarded : while those of the virtuous were 
postponed or totally despised. You know how often I ad- 
dressed him, both by myself and the bishops, more especially 
In the council held last year for that purpose, and that I 
gained by it nothing but odium. Every one, who shall think 
rightly, must be aware, that I ought to love my mortal bro- 
tber, but that I should stiQ more r^ard the cause of my im- 
mortal Father. Wherefore, since God has exercised his 
judgment on my brother, by permitting him, without my 
Knowledge, to fall into the lumds of the powerful, I have 
Invited you all here to assemble by virtue of my legation, lest 
the kingdom should fall to decay through want of a sovereign. 
The case was yesterday agitated in private, before the migor 
part of the English clergy, to whose right it principally per- 
tains to elect the sovereign, and also to crown him. Firsts 
then, as is fitting, invoking 6od*s assistance, we elect the 
daughter of that peaceful, that glorious, that rich, that good, 
and, in our times, incomparable king, as sovereign of Eng- 
land and Normandy, and promise her fidelity and support." 

When all present had either becomingly applauded his 
sentiments, or, by their silence, not contradicted them, he 
added : ** We have despatched messengers for the Londoners, 
who, from the importance of their city in England, are almost 
nobles, as it were, to meet us on this business ; and have 
sent them a safe-conduct : and we trust they will not delay 
their arrival beyond to-morrow : wherefore let us give them 
indulgence till that time." 

On the fourth day of the week the Londoners came ; and 
being introduced to the council, urged their cause, so far as 
to say, that they were sent from &e fraternity, as they call 
it, of London, not to contend, but to entreat that their lord 
the king might be liberated from captivity: that aU the 
barons, who had long since been admitted to their fellowship, 
most earnestly solicited this of the lord legate and the arch- 
bishop, as well as of all the clergy who were present. The 
legate answered them copiously and clearly : and, that their 
request might be the less complied with, the speech of the 
preceding day was repeated, with the addition, that it did 



S20 MOMsmr msroinr* («.n 

not become the Londoners, who were considered as the chief 
people of England, in the light of nobles, to side with those 
persons who had deserted their lord in battle ; by whose ad- 
vice the king had dishonoured the holy church ; and who^ in 
fact, only appeared to favour the Londoners, that they might 
drain them A their money. 

In the meantime, a certain person, whose name, if I 
rightly remember, was Christian, a derk belonging to the 
queen, as I he<urd, rose up^ and hdd forth a paper to the 
legate. He having silently perused it, exalted his voice to 
the highest pitch, and said, that it was informal, and impro- 
per to be recited in so great an assembly, especially of digni- 
fied and rdigious persons. For, among other offensive and 
sii^ular points, the signature of a person was affixed to it, 
who, in l^e preceding year, at a similar council, had attacked 
the venerable bishops with opprobrious language. The le- 
gate thus baffling hun, the clerk was not wantii^ to his mis- 
sion, buty with notaUe confidence, read the letter in their 
hearing ; of which this was the purport ^ The queen ear- 
nestly entreated the whole clergy assembled, and especially 
the bishop of Winchester, the brother of her lord, to restore 
the said lord to his kingdom, whom abandoned persons, and 
even such as were under homage to him, had cast into 
chains." To this suggestion, the legate answered to the 
same effect as to the Londoners. These conferring together, 
declared, that they would relate the decree of the council to 
their townsmen, and give it their suj^iort as far as they 
were able. 

On the fifth day of the week the council broke up, many 
of the royal party having been first excommunicated ; more 
especially William Martel, who had form^ly been cup- 
bearer to king Henry, and was at that time butler to 
Stephen ; for he had sorely exasperated the legate, by inter- 
cepting and pUfering much of his property. It was now a 
work of great difficulty to soothe the minds of the Ixm- 
doners: for though these matters, as I have said, were 
agitated immediately after Easter, yet was it only a few days 
before the Nativity of St John that th^ would recdve the 
empress. At that time great part of England readily sub- 
mitted to her government ; her brother Robert was assidu- 
ously em^yed in promoting her dignity by every becoming

method ; kmdly addressing the nobility, making many pro- 
mises, and intimidating the adverse party, or even, by 
messengers, exhorting them to peace ; and already restoring 
justice, and the law of the bind, and tranquillity, throughout 
every district which favoured the empress ; and it is suffici- 
ently notorious that if his party had trusted to Robert's 
moderation and wisdom, it would not afterwards experienced 
so mebmcholy a reverse. The lord legate, too, appeared of 
laudable fidelity in furthering the interests of the empress. 
But, behold, at the very moment when she imagined she should 
get possession, of all England, every thing was changed. 
The Londoners, ever suspicious and murmuring among 
themselves, now burst out into open expressions of hatred ; 
and, as it is reported, even laid wait for their sovereign and 
her nobles. Aware of and escaping this plot, they -gradually 
retired from the dty, without tumult and in a certain mili- 
tary order. The empress was accompanied by the l^ate 
and David king of Scotland, the heroine's uncle, together 
with her brother Robert who then, as at every other time, 
shared her fortune ; and, in short, all her partisans to a man 
escaped in safety. The Londoners, learning their departure, 
flew to their residence and plundered every thing which they 
had left in their haste. 

Not many days after, a misunderstanding arose between 
the legate and the empress which may be justly considered 
as the melancholy cause of every subsequent evil in Eng- 
land. How this happened I will explain. King Stephen 
had a son named Eustace, b^otten on the daughter of Eus- 
tace earl of Boulogne. For king Henry, the father of the 
empress, that I may go back somewhat to acquaint posterity 
with the truth of these transactions, had given Mary, the 
sister of his wife, the mother of this lady, in marriage to the 
aforesaid earl, as he was of noble descent and equally re- 
nowned for prudence and for valour. By Mary, Eustace 
had no issue except a daughter caUeH Matilda. When she 
became marriageable, after the death of her father, the same 
truly magnificent king gave her in wedlock to his nephew 
Stephen, and also procured by his care the county of Bou- 
logne for him, as he had before conferred on him that of 
Moreton in Normandy. The legate had justly proposed that 
these counties should be bestowed on his nephew Eustace»

whom I mentioned, so long as hia father should remain ia 
captiyity. This the empress altogether opposed, and it is 
doubtfol whether she had not even promised them to otber& 
Offended at the repulse;, he kept from her court manj dajs^ 
and thopgh repeatedlj seat for, persisted in refusing to go 
thither. In the meanwhile, he held a friendlj oonfeieiioe 
with the queen, his brother's wife, at Guildford, and b^z^ 
wrought upon by her tears and concessions, bent his mind to 
the liberation of Stephen. He also absolved, without con- 
sulting the bishops, all those of the king's partj whom be 
had excommunicated in the council, while his oomplaints 
against the empress were disseminated through England 
that she wished to seize his person ; that she observed no- 
thing which she had sworn to him ; that all the barons of 
England had performed their engagements towards her, but 
that she had violated hers, as she knew not how to use her 
prosperitj with moderation. 

To allaj, if possible, these commotions, the earl of Glou- 
cester, with a retinue not very numerous, proceeded to Win- 
chester ; but, failing in his endeavours, he returned to Oxford, 
where his sister had for some time established her residence. 
She therefore understanding, as well from what she was 
continuallj hearing, as from what she then learned from her 
brother, that the legate had no friendlj dispositions towards 
her, proceeded to Winchester with such forces as she could 
muster. Being immediatelj admitted into the rojal castle^ 
with good intentions probably she sent messengers to the 
bishop, requesting that, as she was upon the spot, he would 
come to her without delaj. He, not thinking it safe to go^ 
deceived the messengers bj an evasive manner, merely 
saying, "I will prepare myself:" and immediately he sent 
for all such as he knew were well-disposed to the king. In 
consequence almost all the earls of England came ; for they 
were full of youth and levity, and preferred military enter- 
prise to peace. Besides, many of them were ashamed at 
having deserted the king in battle, as has been said before^ 
and thought to wipe off the ignominy of having fled, by a^ 
tending this meeting. Few, however, attended the empress t 
there were David king of Scotland, Robert earl of Gloch* 
cester, Milo de Hereford, and some barons; for RanuV 
earl of Chester came late, and to no purpose. To comprise^

therefore, a long series of events within narrow limits : the 
roads on everj side of Winchester were watched by the 
queen and the earls who had come with her, lest supplies 
&onld be brought in to those who had sworn fidelitj to the 
empress. The town of Andover also was burned. On the 
west, therefore, necessaries were procured but scantily and 
with difficulty; some persons found on the road, being 
Intercepted and either kUled or maimed ; while on the east^ 
ervery avenue towards London was crowded with supplies 
destined for the bishop and his party ; Geoffrey de Mande- 
▼Ule^ who had now again revolted to them, for formerly after 
the capture of the king he had sworn fideHty to the empress^ 
and the Londoners, lending every possible assistance, and 
omitting no circumstance which might distress that princess. 
The people of Winchester were, though secretly, inclined to 
her side, regarding the faith they had before pledged to her, 
although they had been in some degree compelled by the 
bishop to such a measure. Li the meanwhile combustibles 
were hurled from the bishop's castle on the houses of the 
townspeople, who^ as I have said, rather wished success to 
the empress than to the bishop, which caught and burned 
the whole abbey of nuns within the city, and the monasteiy 
which is called Hyde without the walls. Here was an 
image of our Lord crucified, wrought with a profusion of 
gold and silver and precious stones, through the pious solici- 
tude of Canute, who was formerly king and presented it. 
This being seized by the flames and thrown to the ground, 
was afterwards stripped of its ornaments at the command of 
the legate himself: more than five hundred marks of silver 
and thirty of gold, which were found on it, served for a lar- 
gess to tiie soldiers. The abbey of nuns at Warewell was 
also burned by one William de Ipres, an abandoned character 
who feared neither God nor man, because some of the parti- 
sans of the empress had secured themselves within it. 

In the meantime, the earl of Gloucester, though suffering, 
with his followers, by daily contests with the royalists, and 
though circumstances turned out far beneath his expecta- 
tion, yet ever abstained from the burning of churches, not* 
withstanding he resided in the vicinity of St. Swithun's. 
But unable to endure any longer the disgrace of being, 
together with his party, almost besieged, and seeing fortune 



524 XODEBN HI8T0BT. [b-h. 

indining towards the enemy, he deemed it expedient to yield 
to necessity ; and, having marshalled his troops, he prepared 
to depart Sending his sister, therefore, and the rest, in the 
vanguard, that she might proceed without interruption, he 
himself retreated gently, with a chosen few, who had spirit 
enough not to be alarmed at a multitude. The earls imme- 
diately pursuing him, as he thought it disgraceful, and be- 
neath his dignity to fly, and was ^e chief object of universal 
attack, he was made captive. The rest, especially the chie&, 
proceeded on their destined journey, and, with the utmost 
precipitation, reached Devizes. Thus they departed from 
Winchester on the day of the exaltation of the holy cross, 
which at that time lutppened on a Sunday, havii^ come 
thither a few days before the assumption of the holy mother 
of God. It appeared to some rather miraculous, and was 
matter of general conversation in England, that the king on 
the Sunday of the purification of our lady, and the earl on 
the Sunday of the exaltation of the life-imparting cross, 
should each experience a similar fate. This, however, was 
truly worthy of remark and admiration, that, no one, on this 
mischance, ever beheld the earl of Gloucester eiUier dis- 
pirited or dejected in countenance. He breathed too high 
a consciousness of dignity, to subject himself to the caprice 
of fortune ; and, although he was at first invited by soothing 
measures, and aiterwards assailed by threats, he never con- 
sented to treat of his liberation, except with the privity of 
lus sister. At last the affair was thus decided: that the 
king and himself should be liberated on equal terms; no 
condition being proposed, except that each might defend 
his party, to &e utmost of his abilities, as before. These 
matters, after repeated and long discussion, from the ex- 
altation of the holy cross, to die festival of All Saints, 
then came to a suitable conclusion. For on that day, the 
king, released fr^m his captivity, left his queen, and 80ii» 
and two of the nobility at Bristol, as sureties for the libera- 
tion of the earl ; and came with the utmost speed to Win- 
chester, where the earl, now brought frt>m Bochester, whither 
he had first been taken, was at this time confined* The 
third day after, when the king came to Winchester, the earl 
departed, leaving there on that day his son William, as a 
pledge, till the queen should be released. Performing with 



^Kk 1141.1 OOUNCIL AT WESTMUTSTER. 525 

quick despatch the journey to Bristol, he liberated the queen, 
on whose return, William, the earl's son, was set free from 
his detention. It is, moreoTcr, sufficientlj notorious, that, 
although, during the whole of his captivity and of the fol- 
lowing months till Christmas, he was enticed by numberless 
and magnificent promises to revolt from his sister; yet he 
always deemed lus fraternal affection of greater importance 
than any promise which could be made him. For leaving 
his property and his castles, which he might have quietly 
enjoyed, he continued unceasingly near the empress at Ox- 
ford, whq)re^ as I have said before, fixing her residence, she 
held her eourt. 

In the meantime, the legate, a prelate of unbounded spirit, 
who was never inclined to leave incomplete what he had 
once purposed, summoned by his legatine authority a council 
at Westminster, on the octaves of St. Andrew. I cannot 
relate the transactions of this council with that exact vera- 
city with which I did the former, as I was not present We 
have heard that a letter was then read &om the sovereign 
pope, in which he gently rebuked the legate for not endea- 
vouring to release his brother $ but that he forgave him his 
former transgression, and earnestly exhorted him to attempt 
his liberation by any mode, whether ecclesiastical or secular : 
that the king himself entered the ooundl, and complained 
to the reverend assembly, that his own subjects had both 
made captive, and nearly killed him by the injuries they 
infiicted on him, who had never refused them justice. That 
the legate himself^ too, by great powers of eloquence, endea- 
voured to extenuate the odium of his own conduct : that^ 
in truth, he had received the empress, not from inclination, 
but necessity; for, that, while hiis brother^s overthrow was 
yet recent, all the ^arls being either dbpersed or waiting the 
issue of events in suspense^ she had surrounded Winchester 
with her party : that she had obstinately persevered in 
breaking every promise she had made pertaining to the right 
of the churches : and that he had it from unquestionable 
authority, that she, and her partisans, had not only had 
designs on his dignity, but even on his life: that, however, 
God, in his mercy, had caused matters to fall out contrary 
to her hopes, so that he should himself escape destruction, 
and rescue his brother from captivity: that he commanded 



/ 



526 MODEBN mSTOBT. U^m, 

therefore, on the part of God and of the pope, that Huj 
should strenaoualj assist the king, anointed hj the will of 
the people and with the approbation of the holj see: but 
that such as disturbed the peace, in favour of the oonnteas 
of Anjouy should be excommunicated, with the exception of 
herself who was sovereign of the Angevins. 

I do not sajy that this speech was kindlj received hy all 
the deigjy though certainly no one opposed it ; for all bridled 
their tongues either through fear, or through reverence. 
There was one layman sent from the empress, who openly 
forbade the legate, by the faith which he had pledged to her^ 
to ordain any thing, in that council, repugnant to her hon- 
our ; and said, that he had made oath to the empress, not to 
assbt his brother, unless, perchance, by sending him tw^itj 
horsemen at the utmost: that her coming to England had 
been effected by his frequent letters : that her taking the 
king, and holding him in captivity, had been done princi- 
pally by his connivance. The advocate afllnned these and 
many otiier circumstances, with great harshness of knguag^ 
and by no means sparing the legate. However, he could not 
be prevailed upon, by any force of argument, to lay aside his 
animosity: for, as I have said before, he was an active per- 
severer in what he had once taken in hand. This year, 
therefore, the tragedy of which I have briefly related, was 
fatal, and nearly destructive, to England; during which, 
though conceiving that she might now, perhaps, experience 
some Httle respite, yet, she became again involved in ca- 
lamity, and, unless Grod's mercy shall shortly come to her 
relief, must there long continue. 

It seems fitting that I should commence the transactions 
of this year, which is a.d. 1142, with certain events which 
were unnoticed in the former ; and, at the same time, briefly 
recapitulate what has been said, in various places, of Robert 
earl of Gloucester, son of king Henry, and submit i^ thus 
arranged, to the c6nsideration of the reader. For, as he 
was the first to espouse the just defence of his nster, so did 
he persevere with unshaken constancy in her cause withoiA 
remuneration i I say without remuneration, because some of 
hfit supporters, either following the course of fortune, are 
changed with its revolutions, or having already obtained 
oonsiderable benefits, fight for justice under expectation of 



4J». 1141.1 BOBEBT, BABL OF GLOUCE8TEB. 527 

sdll further recompence: Robert, alone, or nearly alone, un- 
influenced by amch considerationa, was never awajed, as will 
appear hereafter, either bj hope of advantage, or fear of loss. 
Let no one, therefore, suspect me of adulation, if I relate 
these matters circumstantiallj : for I shall make no sacri- 
fice to favour; but pure historical truth, without anj stain 
of falsehood^ shall be handed down to the knowledge of 
posteritj. 

It has been related of the earl, how, first* of all the 
nobilitj, afler David, king of Scotland, he confirmed, bj 
oath, his fealty to his sister, the empress, for the kingdom 
of England, and the duchy of Normandy, in the presence 
of his father Henry. There was some contention, as I have 
aaid, between him and Stephen earl of Boulogne, afterwards 
king bf England, who should swear first; Robert alleging 
the preference of a son, Stephen the dignitf^ of a nephew. 

It has been recorded too, what reasonable causes, from 
December, when his father died, till after the ensuing Easter, 
detained him in Normandy, &om coming immediately into 
England to avenge his sistei^s injuries. And when at last he 
did come, with what just deliberation, and with what proviso^ 
he consented to do homage to the king ; and how justly, 
in the following year, and thenceforward, he abjured it. 

Nor has his second arrival in England from Normandy, 
after his father's death, with his sister, been omitted : where, 
relying on the favour of Grod, and his innate courage^ he 
ventured himself as into a desert full of wild beasts, though 
scarcely accompanied by one hundred and forty horsemen. 
Neither has it been unnoticed, that, amid such tumult of war, 
while anxious watch was kept on all sides, he boldly came to 
Bristol with only twelve horsemen, having committed his 
sister to safe custody, as he supposed, at Arundel : nor with 
what prudence, at that time^ he received her from the very 
midst of her enemies^ and afterwards advanced her in all 
things to the utmost of his power ; ever busied on her ao- 
oount, and n^lecting his own interest to secure hers, while 
some persons taking advantage of his absence, curtailed his 
territories on every side : and^ lastly, urged by what neces- 
sity, namely to rescue his son-in-law, whom the king had

that Stephen preceded Robert in taking the oath to Madlda. 



528 VODBRN mSIQBY. U m. 

besieged, he engaged in a hasardons confliet^ and took the 
king priaoner. This fortonate events however, was some- 
what obscured by his own capture at Winchester, as X have 
recorded in ^e transactions of the former year ; though bj 
the grace of Crod, he showed himflelf, not so mudi an olgec^ 
of commis»«tion, as of praise, in that capture. For, when 
he saw that the royalist earls were so persevering in the pur^ 
suit that the business could not be gotten through without 
loss on his part, he sent forward all those for whom he was 
under apprehension, and more especially the empress. When 
they had proceeded far enough to escape in safety, he fol- 
lowed leisurely, that the retreat might not res^nble a flight, 
and recdved the attack of the pursuers himself ; thus pur- 
chasing, by his own detention, the liber^ of his frieoda. 
And now, even at the moment of his capture, no one; as I 
have said above, perceived him either dispirited, or hnmbled 
in language : he seemed so far to tower above fortune, that 
he compelled his persecutors, for I am loth to call them ene- 
mies, to respect him. Wherefore the queen, though she 
might have remembered, that her husbfmd had been fettered 
by his command, yet never suffered a bond of any kind to be 
put upon lum, nor presumed on her dignity to treat him 
honourably. And finally at Rochester, for thither he 
conducted, he went freely whither he pleased, to the churches 
below the castle, and conversed wilii whom he chose, the 
queen only being present (for after her departure he was 
held in free custody in the keep^ and so calm and serene was 
his mind, that, getting money m>m his vassals in Kent, he 
bought some valuable horses, which were both serviceable 
and beneficial to him afterwards. 

The earls, and those whose business it was to speak of such 
matters, at first, tried if he would allow of the king and him- 
self being liberated on equal terms. Though his countess, 
Mabil, out of solicitude for her beloved husband, would 
have embraced these terms the moment she heard them, being 
through conjugal affection, bent on his liberation, yet he, in 
his wiser policy, refused : asserting that a king and an eari 
were not of equal importance ; however, if they would 
allow all who had been taken with him, or for him, to be 
set at liberty, to this he might consent. But the earls and 
other royalists would not assent to these terms ; they were 



i

•nxions indeed for the lung's libertj, but not at their own 
pecuniarj loss : for earl Gilbert had taken William of Salis- 
bury : and WiUiam de Ipres, Humphry de Bohun ; and 
others had made such captures as they could, at Winchester, 
greedily expecting laige sums for their ransom. 

Next attacking the earl another way, they were anxious to 
allure him with magnificent promises, if so they might effect 
their purpose. Would he go over to the king's side, and 
dismiss his sister, he should govern the whole country : all 
things should await his decision : the crown should be the 
only distincti<m between him and the king : over all others 
he should rule as he pleased. The earl r^ected these un<* 
bounded promises^ with a memorable reply, which I wish 
posterity to hear, and to admire : '*I am not my own master,** 
said he, ** but am in another's power i when I shall see my- 
self at my own disposal, I promise to do every thing which 
reason dictates on the matter you propound." 

Irritated and incensed at this, when they could do nothing 
by fair means, they began to menace, that they would send 
bim over sea to Boulogne, and keep him in perpetual bon- 
dage till death. Still, however, with a serene countenance, 
dispelling their threats, he firmly and truly protested, that he 
feared nothing less. For he reUed on the spirit of his wife, 
the countess, and the courage of his partizans, who would 
immediately send the king into Ireland, if they heard of any 
foul deed perpetrated against himself. 

A montii lapsed in these transactions ; so difficult a work 
was it to effect the liberation of princes whom fortune had 
fettered with her chain.* But, at length, the supporters of 
the empress having conferred together, entreated the earl by 
divers messages, that " as he could not do what he would," 
according to the comic writer, '' he would do what he could f 
he should allow therefore, the king and himself to be set at 
liberty, on equal terms, '* otherwise," said they, ''we fear lest 
the earls, inspirited by the consciousness of their great and 
most distinguished exploit in making yon captive^ should at- 
tack us one by one, reduce our castles, and even make an 
attempt upon your sister." 

Robert, wrought upon at length, assented to the proposal 
of the l^^te and archbishop, but still on condition that none 

• Virgil, JEsL I 88. 



530 KODEHN HI8T0BT. Cb. m. 

of the castlesy or territory, should be restored, which bad 
oome under the power of the empress or of anj of her fidtb- 
ful adherents, since the capture of the king : but be could 
not bj any means obtain the release of his Mends, as he had 
given offence to some persons, in rejecting, with a kind of 
superciliousness their magnificent promises with respect to 
the government of the whole kingdom. And as thej were 
eztremelj anxious that, for the royal dignity, the king should 
be first set at liberty, and then the earl ; when he demurred 
to this, the l^ate and the archbishop made oath, that if the 
king, after his own liberation, refused to release the eaii, 
they would forthwith deliver themselves up into Robert's 
power, to be conducted wherever he pleased. Nor did he 
rest here; for his sagacious mind discovered an additional 
security. It might fall out, that the king, as often happens, 
listening to evil counsel, would consider the detention of his 
brother, and of the archbishop, as of very littie consequence, 
so that he himself were at his ease. He demanded, there- 
fore, from them both, separately, instruments, with their 
seals, addressed to the pope, to the following effect ; ^ That 
the sovereign pope was to understand, that they, for the 
liberation of the king and the peace of the kingdom, had 
bound themselves to the earl by this covenant, that, if the 
king refused to liberate him after his own release, themselves 
would willingly surrender to his custody. Should it, there- 
fore, come to this calamitous issue, they eamestiy entreated, 
what it would well become the papal goodness voluntarily to 
perform, that he would release them, who were his saffin- 
gans, as well as the earl, from unjustifiable durance." There 
was something more to the same effect. 

These writings, received from dther prelate, Bobert depo- 
sited in a place of safety, and came to Winchester with them 
and a great company of the barons. The king also, as has 
been before observed, coming thither soon after, had a firiendly 
interview with the earl. But although he, and all the earls 
present, eagerly busied themselves in bringing over Robert 
to their wishes, yet, ** firm as a rock amid the ocean" in his 
resistance, he rendered their attempts abortive, or refuted 
them by argument. He affirmed, that, it was neither reason- 
able nor natural, that he should desert his sister, whose cauae 
he had justiy espoused, not for any benefit to himself, nor so 



N

much out of dislike to the king, as regard to his oath, which, 
they abio ought to remember, it was impietj to violate, espe- 
ciaUy when he called to mind, that he had been enjoined bj 
the pope to respect the oath he had taken to his sister in the 
presence of his father. Thus failing of peace, thej severally 
departed. ^ 

The reason why I have not incorporated these events with \ 
the transactions of the former year is that I did not then I 
know them ; for I have always dreaded to transmit anything ; 
to posterity, through my narrative, the truth of which I / 
could not perfectly vouch for. What, then, I have to relate/ 
of the present year will commence as follows. > 

The respective parties of the empress and of the king, 
conducted themselves with quiet forbearance from Christmas 
to Lent, anxious rather to preserve their own, than to ravage 
the possessions of others. The king went to a distant 
part of the kingdom for the purpose of quelling some disturb- 
ances. Lent coming on gave all a respite from war ; in 
the midst of which the empress came with her party to De- 
vizes, where her secret designs were debated. So much of 
them, however, transpired that it was known that all her 
partizans had agreed to send for the earl of Anjou, who was 
most interested in the defence of the inheritance of his wife 
and children in England. Men of respectability were, there- 
fore, despatched and such as might fitly execute a business of 
such magnitude. Not long after, nearly on the Easter holi- 
days, the king, while meditating, as it is said, some harsh 
measures, was detained by an acute disease at Northampton ; 
so severe, indeed, that he was reported, almost throughout 
England, as being at the point of death. His sickness con- 
tinued till after Pentecost, when returning health gradually 
restored him. Li the meantime, the messengers returning 
from Anjou, related the result of their mission to the 
empress and the princes in a second council, held at Devizes 
on the octaves of Pentecost. They said that the earl of 
Anjou in some measure favoured the mission of the nobility, 
but that among them all he was only well acquainted with 
the earl of Gloucester, of whose prudence and fidelity, great- 
ness of mind and industry, he had long since had proof. 
Were he to make a voyage to him he would, as £Eur as he 
was able, accede to his wishes: but that all other persons 

MM 2 



532 KODEBK mSTOST. [k.m. 

would expend tbeir labour in passing and repassing to no 
purpose. 

The hopes of all the assembly being thus excited, thej 
entreated that the earl would condescend to undertake thb 
task on account of the inheritance of his sister and of his 
nephews. At first he excused himself, alleging the diffi- 
culty of the business, the perilous journey, beset with 
enemies on either side of the sea; that it would be at- 
tended with danger to his sister, as in his absence thoee 
persons would be hardly able to defend her, who^ distrusting 
even the strength of their own party, had nearly deserted 
her during his captiyity. Yielding at length to the general 
desire, he demanded hostages, especially from those who 
were considered as the chief persons, to be taken with him 
into Normandy, and to be pledges, as well to the earl of An- 
jou as to the empress; and that all, continuing at Oxford, 
should unite in defending her from injury to the utmost 
while he was absent His propositions were eagerly ap- 
proved, and hostages given him to be conducted into 
Normandy. 

Robert, therefore, bidding adieu to his sister, and taking 
with him his hostages and some light troops, proceeded by 
safe marches to Wareham, which town and castle be had 
long since entrusted to his eldest son William. There^ soon 
after the festival of St. John, committing himself, by the 
grace of God, to the ocean, with such vessels as he tiien pos- 
sessed, he weighed anchor. When they were about mid-aea, 
a tempest arising, all except two were dispersed ; some were 
driven back, and some carried beyond their destination. 
Two only, in one of which was the earl with his most faith- 
ful adherents, keeping their course, arrived in the wished-for 
port Proceeding thus to Caen, he sent messengers for the 
earl of Aigou. The earl came without reluctance, but 
stated his difficulties, and those not a few, to the object of 
the embassy when proposed to him ; among others that he 
should be detained from coming into England by the rebel- 
lion of many castles in Normandy. This circumstance de- 
layed the earl of Gloucester's return longer than he had 
intended : for, that he might deprive the earl of Anjou of 
every evasion, he assisted him in subduing ten castles in 
Normandy. The names of which were Tenerchebrei, Seith- 



AJD. 1142.] BSTUBN OF THE EABL OF GLOUCESTEB. 533 

flarety Brichesart, Alani, Bastenborg, Triveres^ Castel de 
Vira, Placeit, Vilers, Moreton. Yet even by this activity, 
he furthered the end of his mission but little. The earl of 
Anjou stated fresh causes, as the former were done away, to 
excuse his coming into England. Indeed, as a very singular 
&vour, he permitted his eldest son, bj the empress, to accom- 
pany his uncle to England, by whose presence the chiefs 
might be encouraged to defend the cause of the lawful heir. 
The youth is named Henry, after his grandfather ; may he 
hereaiter resemble him in happiness and in power. 

In England, in the meantime, the king seizing the oppor- 
tunity of the earl's absence came unexpectedly to Wareham, 
and finding it slightly garrisoned, he burned and plundered 
the town, and immediately got possession of the castle alsa 
Not content with this, as he saw fortune inclined to favour 
him, three days before the festival of St Michael, by an un- 
expected chance,* he burned the city of Oxford, and laid 
siege to the castle, in which was the empress with her do- 
mestic guards. This he did with such determined resolution, 
that he declared no hope of advantage or fear of loss should 
induce him to depart till the castle was delivered up, and the 
empress surrendered to his power. Shoilly after, all the 
nobility of the empress's party, ashamed of being absent 
from their sovereign in violation of their compact, assembled in 
large bodies at WaJlingford, with the determination of attack- 
ing the king if he would risk a battle in the open plain ; but 
they had no intention of assailing him witlun the city, as 
Bobert earl of Gloucester had so fortified it with ditches that 
it appeared impregnable unless by fire. 

These rumours becoming prevalent in Normandy, Robert 
hastened his return. He embarked, therefore, somewhat 
more than three, but less than four hundred horsemen, on 
board fifty-two vessels ; to these were added two which he 
took at sea on his return. God's grace so singularly favoured 
his pious resolution that not one ship, out of so great a num- 
ber, was separated, but all nearly close together, or gently 
proceeding one before the other, ploughed the calm bosom of 
the deep. Nor did the waves violently dash against the

fleet, but rather seemed subserviently to further their pass- 
age, like that most beautiful appearance at sea when the 
wave gradually approaching gently breaks upon the shore. 
Thus making the port of Wareham, these fayoured yesseb 
restored the earl and all his companions to the wishes of 
their friends. 

He had at first thought of landing at Southampton, at 
once to wreak his vengeance both on its inhabitants and cm 
their lord: but this resolution was changed through the 
repeated entreaties of the Vituli, who were fearful that their 
dearest connexions, who resided at Southampton, would be 
involved in the general calamity. These are a kind of 
mariners, who are known by the name of Vituli ; and as 
they are his faithful adherents he thought fit to listen to their 
petitions, and desist from his design. Again, it appeared 
more dignified to return to the place whence he had departed, 
and to recover by force what he had lost by a similar mode. 
Reducing, therefore, immediately the port and town, he laid 
siege to the castle, which by its strength stimulated the spi- 
rit, not to call it obstinacy, of those of the king's choicest 
troops who defended it. Yet, nevertheless, soon afler, the 
garrison, shaken in their resolution by the engines of the 
earl, and greatly alarmed, begged a truce, that, as is the 
custom of the military, they might demand assistance from 
the king, consenting to deliver up the castle if he refused to 
come by a certain day. This, though he was possessed with 
the utmost impatience to become master of the fortress, was 
very agreeable to the earl, as it led him to suppose it might 
draw off Stephen from besieging his sister. We may imagine 
what firmness of mind this man possessed who, with little 
more than three hundred horsemen, and as yet joined by no 
succours in England, could undauntedly await the king, who 
was reported to have more than a thousand ; for many per- 
sons had joined the siege, not so much through dislike to the 
empress as through the hope of plunder. 

However, when it was certified that the king, from that 
resolution which I have before mentioned, refused assistance 
to the besieged at Wareham, the earl obtained the castle, and 
with the same attack subdued the island of Portland, which 
they had fortified, as well as a third castle, called Lullewar- 
den, which belonged to a certain chamberlain, called William

of Gliutonbaijy who bad lately revolted from the empress. 
Robert then, at the banning of Advent, summoned the 
whole of Matilda's partisans to Cirencester : where all resolv- 
ing to afford their sovereign every possible assistance, they 
meditated a march to Oxford ; courageously determining to 
give the king battle, unless he retreated. But as thej were 
on their route^ the pleasing account reached them, that the 
empress had escaped from the blockaded castle at Oxford, 
and was now at Wallingford in security. Turning aside 
thither, then, at the suggestion of their sovereign, since the 
soldiers who had remained at her departure, after delivering 
up the castle, had gone away without molestation, and the 
holidays admonished them to repose awhile, they resolved to 
abstain from battle, and retired to their homes. 

I would very willingly subjoin the manner of the em-^ 
press's liberation, did I know it to a certainty ; for it is un- 
doubtedly one of God's manifest mirades. This, however, is 
sufficiently notorious, that, through fear of the earl's approach, 
many of the besiegers at Oxford stole away wherever they 
were able^ and the rest remitted their vigilance, and kept 
not so good a look out as before ; more anxious for their own 
safety, in case it came to a battle, than bent on the destruc- 
tion of others.* This circumstance being remarked by the 
townsmen, the empress, with only four soldiers, made her 
escape through a small postern, and passed the river. After- 
wards, as necessity sometimes, and indeed, almost always, 
discovers means and ministers courage, she went to Abing- 
don on foot, and thence reached Wallingford on horse-back. 
But this I purpose describing more fuUy, if, by God's per- 
mission, I shall ever learn the truth of it firom those who 
were present
