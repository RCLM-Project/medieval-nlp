Tin-; lirst manuscript of this interesting story of " oure 
knyghten i^estes yn Irlande" (^2/15), and of Henry I I's 
Conquest of our sister Isle, was sent over to me from the 
Library of Trinity College, Dublin, by Dr. John K. Ingram, 
to be copied, printed, and edited by him for the Early English 
'IV\f, Society. He hoped to do his work at it during his 
July-September holiday (1893) in Scotland, on Loch Lomond, 
I having read his proofs with the MS. for him. But illness 
prevented him ; and so I (as the Society's man-of-all-work) 
had to take the book up. Both the story told mainly, 
though freely, from the Expngnacio llllcnnca of Giraldus 
Cambrensis, and the forms of the words, interested me. 
For the copier of the englisht text has often slipt into his 
own Irish dialect, specially in the use of d and t for th, and 
has written dynge l and tynge 2 for thing ; drogh 3 and trogh 4 
for through \ day for ///<;//"'; id row (18/i) for thrown ; tanked 
for thanked (14/19); lynke for think (6/26); toght for thought 
(16/25,18/7); tough (as once in The Three Rings Sons) for 
Unmgh (22/14); &c. At the same time he has used th for 
t and //: thcdynge (10/7) and fythynge (6/15) for tidings ; 
on t her (6/31) for under ; rent (8/1) for ruth\ bethwen (10/12) 
for behreeu ; thwey (12/35) for ftro ; herth (2/8, 13, 22/28) for 
hrart ; ibansheth (24/i) for baniM ; lendeth (22/1 6) for tn<l, .1 ; 
*myt/t (24/i 2) for */;///', &c. The copier has other peculiarities, 
both in the use of other consonants and vowels 6 , which the 
reader will note as he goes along, and which will be collected 
for him in the Introduction by Dr. Douglas Bruce, of the 
Ladies College at Bryn Mawr, Philadelphia, that will form

vill T1IUEE ENGLISH MSS. TWO EDITIONS OF THE KXl'UGA'AL'W. 

Part II. of this book, when complete, and will no doubt be 
finisht in 1894, or '95. 

As it was now and then hard to understand the Dublin text, 
and one nearer the standard tongue turnd up in the Rawlin- 
son MS. B. 490 the MS. that contains one of Mr. Steele's 
text of the prose Secreta I got Mrs. Parker to copy this 
Bodleian MS. l , and the Clarendon Press to set it opposite 
the Dublin one. The comparison of the two versions is full 
of interesting points, as the Rawlinson is generally less 
archaic than the Dublin 2 , while each helps to fill up the 
other's occasional leavings-out. There is at least one other 
MS. of the Conquest^ the later one in Trinity College, Dublin, 
F. 4. 4, which is said to be a i6th century transcript of 
J3. 2. 31. From it, an extract is given below, pp. xiv-xvi 
as a specimen. Doubtless, other MSS. of the text exist 
elsewhere. Luckily for us, the late Rev. Jas. F. Dimock 
re-edited the Expugnatio Hibernica in vol. v. (1867) Giraldi 
Camlrensis Opera in the Rolls Series of Chronicles and 
Memorials ; and his notes, dates, and Preface have been of the 
greatest use to me. He says (p. xxix) that there are two 
editions, and perhaps a third, of the Expugnacio: (i) that in 
an early I3th century MS. at Lambeth, No. 371, ' probably 
penned during Giraldus's lifetime" (p. xxxi), and in (R.) and 
(B.), MSS. Bibl. Reg. 13 B. viii in the British Museum, and 
Rawlinson B. 188 in the Bodleian. In treating the two 
latter MSS. as of the first cast of the work, Mr. Dimock 
neglects the marginal additions of the Royal MS. These 
additions make (2) the second version of the Expiignacio 
(pp. xxxii, xxxiv), shown in (R.), and MS. Ff. I. 27, in the 
University Library, Cambridge, in which "there is one whole 
chapter, (also in our English, p. 38-40 below) the eighteenth 
of the first book giving the account of the synod at Armagh 
in 1170, of which no other mention is known besides this, 

1 Mr. George Parker has collated the proofs with the MS. Mr. Thomas 
Austin has made the Glossary and Indexes to both Texts. Dr. Ingram wrote 
the English side-notes to the even pages 10-32, tho I've alterd 2 or 3 of em. 

2 I suppose the first englishing now represented by the Dublin MS. was 
made in the I4th century.

For this, the other MSS., R. and B., have " primus hie 
miles, jui in hac insula niso mansueto et domesticate Nisi 
iiliam infestavit." 

On this Harleian 177, Mr. Dimock says, at p. xxxv of his 
Preface : 

(it) "furnishes a copy of the Expugnaiio which, so far as it 
goes, it has many and large omissions generally agrees closely 
with the text of this second edition. . . . The omissions are more 
i-sjurially of the extraneous matter, not relating to Ireland; but 
there is much curtailing also of Irish matter, when not directly 
historical. In the descriptions of the heroes, for instance, much 
nl'trii is left out; and in the orations which Giraldus puts into 
their mouths, still more. The compiler of it never condenses, but 
simply omits. In an oration ... he will retain two or three 
si nt( lu-es of the hi-gi lining, and two or three more of the end, with 
perhaps another or two out of the middle, if not very much less 
than all this, word for word as in the complete oration, without 
much care about connection or sense ... it certainly is only an 
abbreviation, sm-h as I describe it." 

This is just the case with our English text ! , though here 
and there it has bits not in Harl. 177. As to that MS., 
Mr. Dimock continues, pp. xxxv-vi: 

"It generally agrees closely, as I have taid, with the second

edition, as in (R.) and (F.); but it exhibits a gomewhat more 
advanced text. For instance, the word Stadia of (L)ambeth MS. 
occurs only twice instead of four times, out of eight as in 
(R)awlinson MS.: and instead of Arcarii always, as in the early 
manuscripts, it has the Satellites equestres of the later ones, in 
about half the instances where the words occur. And, moreover, 
in a few instances, it has a word or two that are not in the early 
manuscripts, but are in the later ones. 

This manuscript has no note whatever as to its history ; but it, 
or its original perhaps, would seem to have been written by one of 
the English settlers in Ireland, as it attempts occasionally, instead 
of Giraldus's Latin of all the other manuscripts, to give an English 
rendering of the Irish names. Thus, instead of Murcliardijilius, 
or Dermitius, or MurcJiar elides, it has ' Macmorthit ' or ' Mac- 
morhith ' ; instead of Ororicitu, ' Oroch.' In one instance the 
writer appears to make a blunder in his Englishing : he renders 
Otuethelis 'Oneyl' instead of O'Toole. ... It is not the work of 
a very correct scribe." 

As a sample of the cutting-down, by Harl. 177, of Giraldus's 
descriptions of men, take the most trenchant instance, that of 
Henry II. In the Rolls edition, this description takes nearly 
six big octavo pages, Op. v. 301-6, the whole of Chapter 46, 
Book I. Leaving out the first page, Harl. 177 and the 
englisber start with the second, p. 302 :

On the authority of Giraldus, Mr. Dimock comments on 
pages Ixxx-lxxxii of his Preface, and thus concludes : 

" Recent Irish scholars have quietly received Giraldus for what 
he is worth, as an impetuous, strongly biassed writer, whose state- 
ments have generally more or less of truth in them, but with much 
unfair one-sidedness. They have seen that his abuse is not con- 
fined to Ireland and the Irish, but is almost equally as fully 
lavished upon his own Wales and the Welsh; that, in fact, he has 
praise for scarcely any thing or body except himself and his near 
friends and relations. Some late Irish writers, under the reaction 
1>( i haps of his having been found too much fault with, seem to me 
to put more faith in Giraldus's history than it really deserves."

When the kinge did knowe his entent, and whether he would 
goe, he gave him fully leve, and warned him not. but with such 
leave as he hadde, he dighte and made him ready the wy liter, till 
the begininge of may, he sente before him into Irelande a knighte 
that was called Reymonde le gras ; with him, tenn knights, and 
fortye Squiers, and fourescore bowemen ; a man full hardy, and 
well proved in weapon; Roberts nephewe, and Morices Eldeste 
brothers sone. They arryved at a place called Dondoneuile, foure 
myle besouthe the ha wen of Waterforde ; and there they arrearede 
a diche, and a feble castell upon, of yards and turues p MS. 
iureus]. The men of Waterforde, and with them Malaughlyne 
Ofolane, they did understande that they had such Neighbourehede 
wAt'ch them lothed : they concluded that they would upon them, or 
enwy more weare to them come, they assembled them together, 
well thre thowsande men, and wente over the water of sure, that 
partethe the twoe counties of leynester and of Mounester, and sett 
them in thre hosts, bouldely for to assaile the Englishmen within 
there Castell. Reymounde and his men, thoughe they weare but 
fewe, they weare not fainte to fighte with uneven hoste, they 
assemblede them together ; But, as noe wonder was, soe fewe men 
mighte nat fighte againste soe many ; theie turned them againe to 
there receipte. the other, thinkinge that they departed in discom- 
feture, they brake there sheldruw, and followed them: and they 
weare not fully within the gate, but some of them weare rather in 
[than] thenglyshe men. Reymonde sawe that he and his weare in 
greate perill, and upon pointe to losse there lyves. he cried to his 
fellowes, and turned worthely upon there foemen. and the firste

THE ENGLISH CONQUEST OF IRELAND. 

EARLY ENGLISH TEXT SOCIETY. No. 107. 
Original Series, 1896. 

Boxom-fastines 62/i8: this should be two words, buxom fastness, an 

obsequious covenant, meant to render L.fucatofoedere. 
Costes : part of far-costes below. 
Ense 80/29: read Euse, eaves, edge, border: 'the wode evese (ms. hevese) 

voc. 159.' Bradley 's Stratmann. 
Far-costes 80/5 : ' O.N. farkostr ; means of conveyance, boat, ship, Engl. Metr. 

Horn, xix.' ib. 
Pawes 96/2 : perhaps the Irish fogha (O'ReiUy), a dart, O.Ir. fogae (Lat. 

jacula). 
Polk place 50/15 : the folk (for febyll in the Rawlinson MS.) was caught 

from the ' lond-folk ' in the next line. 
Herrer 116/30 : the Latin is ' et citra majoris auctoritatem urbem obten- 

turum.' Gir. Cambr. Op. v. 342. 
I-quenyted 86/35 : miswritten for Iquemed, pleased. 
I-suywed 116/9 ' rea< ^ I-snywed, ' snowed ' their arrows ; the Latin is ' sagit- 

tarum . . . grandine perfuso.' 
Lygne 102/17: aa fayre & lygne translates 'procerus et pulcher,' the word 

must mean ' tall ' ; perhaps it is a misreading for hyghe, high. 
Lyme 62/i8: the Latin has amorem; the scribe must have misread luue 

(love) as lime, and transcribed it lyme. 
Ost 50/2 : cannot mean ' burnt.' The word is superfluous ; perhaps the 

translator at first wrote lytell ost (little host), and then altered ost into ston- 

wal, but did not clearly enough expunge the rejected word. 

Priuisant 80/28 : cannot mean ' foreseeing ' ; it is probably a mistake for pur- 

siuant, pursuivant (the Latin is satelles). 
Kyuely 128/12: rifely, abundantly. 
Sheldrun 81/29 (R) : company-formation, O.E. scild-truma (whence shelter} ; 

the Rawlinson MS. here preserves the right reading, that of the Dublin MS. 

being unmeaning. 

Spourges 112/3 : ?f r spronges, shoots, sprouts. 
porwe 28/12 : ? through ; wel porwe 'well through,' urgently (the Latin is 

' omnibus modis '). 

Trukked 48/9 : ran short) trukien, O.E. trucian, fail, be lacking. 
Wecchene 86/31 : cwecchen, to twitch, shake. 
Wenttene 106/8 : for weten, know (pat is to weten = that is to say) ; the 

scribe was misled by seeing wentten (went) in the line above. 
Yonre 104/io: Youre 114/27 : yovre, seofre, 0. E. slfre, greedy.

of the people. The great difference between French warfare, and 
that of Ireland and Wales [is]: In these countries, light-armed 
troops [are] more especially necessary. In any expedition into 
Inland or \Vales, the troops of the Welsh Marches [are] by far 
the le>t. In \r'^\\ warfare, archers [ought] to be united with the

improved. The Irish, once fully subjected, [ought] to be forbidden 
the use of arms ; [and] meanwhile not to be allowed to bear the 
axe. [They ought] to pay an annual tribute in gold or birds." 

Giraldus's Third Book tells how he found and translated the 
Prophecies of Merlin of Celidon. 

When John became King of England, Giraldus sent him a copy 
of his Tojiograpltia and Expugnacio, with a Proem or Dedicatory 
Letter printed in the Rolls edition, v. 405-411. It reminds John 
of Ireland, exhorts him not to forget it, the Golden Isle, in favour 
of England, the Silver one ; says it will form a kingdom for one of 
his sons ; warns him that he must leave no danger behind him in 
Ireland when he goes to recover the foreign possessions he has 
lost; calls on him to fulfil Henry II's pledges to Pope Adrian, 
that is, to exalt the Church in Ireland and pay Peter's pence; 
instances God's vengeance on the non-keeping of these pledges; 
says how miserable the state of the Irish Church is ; and advises 
John to take an annual tribute of gold, birds, or trees, from the 
Irish in token of subjection. Lastly, Giraldus asks that a scholar 
may translate his books into French ; gives Walter Map's opinion 
on his own talk and Giraldus's writings; and says that he (Giraldus) 
is now old, and l desires only God's favour and the appreciation of 
his labours by posterity/ 



pp. 144-5, lines 9-2 from foot. The side-note and Latin in 

the Kolls edition, v. 392, are: 

Prevalence Praeterea, quamquam hostilitatis instante procella, armatae 
suits. militiae tempus ingruerit, non togatae, tanta tamen civilium 

causarum urgebat importunitas, ut miles veteranus non tarn hoste
