        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The English
        version of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Ecclesiastical
        History”</span> in the following pages is a revision of the
        translation of Dr. Giles, which is itself a revision of the earlier
        rendering of Stevens. In the present edition very considerable
        alterations have been made, but the work of Dr. Giles remains the
        basis of the translation. The Latin text used throughout is Mr.
        Plummer's. Since the edition of Dr. Giles appeared in 1842, so much
        fresh work on the subject has been done, and recent research has
        brought so many new facts to light, that it has been found necessary
        to rewrite the notes almost entirely, and to add a new introduction.
        After the appearance of Mr. Plummer's edition of the Historical Works
        of Bede, it might seem superfluous, for the present at least, to
        write any notes at all on the <span class="tei tei-q">“Ecclesiastical
        History.”</span> The present volume, however, is intended to fulfil a
        different and much humbler function. There has been no attempt at any
        original work, and no new theories are advanced. The object of the
        book is merely to present in a short and convenient form the
        substance of the views held by trustworthy authorities, and it is
        hoped that it may be found useful by those students who have either
        no time or no inclination to deal with more important works.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among the books of
        which most use has been made, are Mr. Plummer's edition of the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Ecclesiastical History,”</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagevi">[pg vi]</span><a name="Pgvi" id="Pgvi" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Messrs. Mayor and Lumby's edition of
        Books III and IV, Dr. Bright's <span class="tei tei-q">“Early English
        Church History,”</span> and Dr. Hunt's <span class="tei tei-q">“History of the English Church from its foundation to the
        Norman Conquest.”</span> Many of the articles in the <span class="tei tei-q">“Dictionary of Christian Biography”</span> and the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Dictionary of Christian Antiquities,”</span>
        Dr. Mason's <span class="tei tei-q">“Mission of St.
        Augustine,”</span> Dr. Rhŷs's <span class="tei tei-q">“Celtic
        Britain,”</span> and a number of other books, mentioned in the notes,
        have been consulted.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For help received
        in different ways I wish to express my gratitude to various
        correspondents and friends. I am particularly indebted to Mr. Edward

        suggestions. For information on certain points I have to thank the
        Rev. Charles Plummer, Fellow of Corpus Christi College, Oxford,
        Professor Lindsay of St. Andrews University, Miss Wordsworth,
        Principal, and Miss Lodge, Vice-Principal of Lady Margaret Hall,
        Oxford; and in a very special sense I wish to acknowledge my
        obligations to Miss Paterson, Assistant Librarian at the University
        Library, St. Andrews, whose unfailing kindness in verifying

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There are, it has
        been estimated, in England and on the Continent, in all about 140
        manuscripts of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Ecclesiastical
        History.”</span> Of these, four date from the eighth century: the
        Moore MS. (Cambridge), so called, because, after being sold by
        auction in the reign of William III, it came into the possession of
        Bishop Moore, who bequeathed it to the University of Cambridge;
        Cotton, Tiberius A, xiv; Cotton, Tiberius C, ii; and the Namur MS. A
        detailed account of these, as well as of a great number of other
        manuscripts, will be found in Mr. Plummer's Introduction to his
        edition of Bede's Historical Works. He has been the first to collate
        the four oldest MSS., besides examining numerous others and collating
        them in certain passages. He has pointed out that two of the MSS.
        dating from the eighth century (the century in which Bede died), the
        Moore MS. and Cotton, Tiberius A, xiv, point to a common original
        which cannot be far removed from Bede's autograph. We are thus
        brought very near to our author, and may have more than in most cases
        the assurance that we have before us what he actually meant to
        say.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The earliest
        editions were printed on the Continent; the <span class="tei tei-q">“editio princeps”</span> is believed to date from 1475. A
        number of editions followed in the sixteenth and seventeenth
        centuries; the first in England was published by Abraham Whelock at
        Cambridge in 1643-4. Smith's <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexx">[pg
        xx]</span><a name="Pgxx" id="Pgxx" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        edition in 1722 marked a new era in the history of the book. It was
        the first critical edition, the text being based on the Moore MS.
        collated with three others, of which two were eighth century MSS.;
        and succeeding editors, Stevenson (1841), Giles (1842), Hussey
        (1846), the editor in the <span class="tei tei-q">“Monumenta
        Historica Britannica”</span> (1848), Moberly (1869), Holder (1882),
        base their work mainly on Smith's. Mr. Mayor and Mr. Lumby together
        edited Books III and IV with excellent notes in 1878. Their text
        <span class="tei tei-q">“reproduces exactly the Moore MS.”</span>
        which they collated with some other Cambridge MSS. (cf. Mayor and
        Lumby, Excursus II). In 1896 the Rev. C. Plummer published his
        edition of Bede's Historical Works, the first critical edition since
        Smith's, and <span class="tei tei-q">“the very first which exhibits
        in an <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">apparatus
        criticus</span></span> the various readings of the MSS. on which the
        text is based.”</span> For the student of Bede this admirable book is
        of the highest value, and the labours of all succeeding editors are
        made comparatively light. Besides the most minute and accurate work
        on the text, it contains a copious and interesting commentary and the
        fullest references to the various sources upon which the editor has
        drawn.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first
        translation of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Ecclesiastical
        History”</span> is the Anglo-Saxon version, executed either by Alfred
        himself or under his immediate supervision. Of this version Dr.
        Hodgkin says: <span class="tei tei-q">“As this book had become a kind
        of classic among churchmen, Alfred allowed himself here less liberty
        than in some of his other translations. Some letters, epitaphs, and
        similar documents are omitted, and there is an almost complete
        erasure of the chapters relating to the wearisome Paschal
        controversy. In other respects the king's translation seems to be a
        fairly accurate reproduction of the original work.”</span> Mr.
        Plummer, however, finds it <span class="tei tei-q">“very rarely
        available for the settlement of minute differences of
        reading.”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxi">[pg
        xxi]</span><a name="Pgxxi" id="Pgxxi" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first modern
        English translation is Thomas Stapleton's (1565), published at
        Antwerp. It is a controversial work, intended to point out to Queen
        Elizabeth <span class="tei tei-q">“in how many and weighty pointes
        the pretended refourmers of the Church ... have departed from the
        patern of that sounde and Catholike faith planted first among
        Englishmen by holy S. Augustin, our Apostle, and his vertuous
        company, described truly and sincerely by Venerable Bede, so called
        in all Christendom for his passing vertues and rare lerning, the
        Author of this History.”</span> To save Elizabeth's time <span class="tei tei-q">“in espying out the particulars,”</span> the translator
        has <span class="tei tei-q">“gathered out of the whole History a
        number of diversities between the pretended religion of Protestants
        and the primitive faith of the english Church.”</span> If charm and
        appropriateness of style were the only qualities to be aimed at in a
        translation, we might well content ourselves with this rendering,
        which fills with despair the translator of to-day, debarred by his
        date from writing Elizabethan English.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The work was again
        translated by John Stevens (1723), and a third time (with some
        omissions) by W. Hurst in 1814. In 1840 Dr. Giles published a new
        edition of Stevens's translation with certain alterations; and a
        second edition of the same volume was published in 1842, and
        incorporated in the collected works of Bede, edited by Dr. Giles. In
        1870 a literal translation by the Rev. L. Gidley was published. The
        present volume is a revision of the translation of Dr. Giles.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A brief analysis
        of the work may be of some use to the student in keeping distinct the
        different threads of the narrative, as owing to the variety of
        subjects introduced, and the want of strict chronological order, it
        is difficult to grasp the sequence of events as a coherent whole.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The sources from
        which Bede draws his material are <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxii">[pg xxii]</span><a name="Pgxxii" id="Pgxxii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> briefly indicated in the dedication to King
        Ceolwulf which forms the Preface, and in it he acknowledges his
        obligations to the friends and correspondents who have helped and
        encouraged him. For the greater part of Book I (cc. 1-22), which
        forms the introduction to his real subject, he depends on earlier
        authors. Here he does not specify his sources, but indicates them
        generally as <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">priorum scripta</span></span>.
        These authors are mainly Pliny, Solinus, Orosius, Eutropius, and the
        British historian Gildas. In the story of Germanus and Lupus he
        follows closely the Life of Germanus by Constantius of Lyons. Prosper
        of Aquitaine also supplies him with some materials. When he comes to
        his main subject, the History of the English Church, he appears to
        rely but little upon books. Only a very few are referred to here and
        there, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span>, The Life of St. Fursa, The
        Life of St. Ethelburg, Adamnan's work on the Holy Places, and the
        Anonymous Life of St. Cuthbert. That some form of annalistic records
        existed before his time, and that these were consulted by him, we may
        infer from some of his chronological references (cf. iii, <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#Book_III_Chap_I" class="tei tei-ref">1</a>, <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#Book_III_Chap_IX" class="tei tei-ref">9</a>). Local information
        with regard to provinces other than Northumbria he obtains from his
        correspondents in various parts of England, and these are expressly
        mentioned in the Preface.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For the history of
        the Roman mission and of Kent generally, as well as some particulars
        with regard to the conversion of other provinces, his chief source is
        the Church of Canterbury, which apparently possessed, besides oral
        tradition, written documents relating to the first beginnings of the
        Church. Moreover, Nothelm, who was the bearer of much important
        material, had been to Rome and had permission to search the papal
        archives. But it is in dealing with the history of Northumbria, as is
        natural, that Bede's information is most varied and copious. Much of
        it is apparently obtained directly from <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxiii">[pg xxiii]</span><a name="Pgxxiii" id="Pgxxiii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> eye-witnesses of the events, much would
        doubtless be preserved in the records of the Church of Lindisfarne,
        to which he had access, perhaps also in his own monastery. We know
        that the monasteries kept calendars in which the death-days of saints
        and others were entered, and other records of similar nature (cf.
        <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#Book_IV_Chap_XIV" class="tei tei-ref">iv, 14</a>), and that
        these were used as materials for history.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Passing to the
        history itself, we may trace a division of subjects or periods
        roughly analogous to the division into books. Book I contains the
        long introduction, the sending of the Roman mission, and the
        foundation of the Church; Books II and III, the period of missionary
        activity and the establishment of Christianity throughout the land.
        Book IV may be said to describe the period of organization. In Book V
        the English Church itself becomes a missionary centre, planting the
        faith in Germany, and drawing the Celtic Churches into conformity
        with Rome.</p>

        <div class="tei tei-tb">

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Book
        I.</span></span>—In Book I, cc. 1-22, Bede sketches the early history
        of Britain, describing the country and giving some account of the
        various races by whom it was inhabited. The story of the Roman
        occupation is narrated at some length, the invasions of the Picts and
        Scots and consequent miseries of the Britons, their appeals for help
        to the Romans, the final departure of their protectors, and the
        coming of the Saxons are described. We have some shadowy outlines of
        British Church History in the legendary account of the conversion of
        King Lucius, in the story of St. Alban, affording evidence of a great
        persecution of Christians during the Roman occupation, in the
        allusions to the Arian and Pelagian heresies, and in the mission of
        Germanus and Lupus. A brief allusion to the mission of Palladius is
        all that we hear of the Irish Church at this period.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These chapters are
        introductory to the main subject, the History of the English Church,
        which begins in <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxiv">[pg
        xxiv]</span><a name="Pgxxiv" id="Pgxxiv" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        Chapter 23 with the mission of St. Augustine in 597 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> The reception of the
        Christian faith in the kingdom of Kent and the foundation of a
        national Church occupy the remaining chapters of the book. Various
        letters of Pope Gregory relating to the mission and his answers to
        the questions of Augustine are given at length; and the Book
        concludes with a piece of Northumbrian history, Ethelfrid's conquests
        of the Britons and the defeat of Aedan, king of the Dalriadic Scots,
        at Degsastan in 603 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Book
        II.</span></span>—Book II opens with a biographical sketch of Gregory
        the Great, the founder of the Mission. This is followed by an account
        of Augustine's negotiations with the leaders of the British Church
        with regard to the Paschal question and some other matters, his
        failure to win them over (a failure apparently largely due to his own
        want of tact in dealing with the susceptible Celtic temperament), his
        alleged prophecy of disaster and its fulfilment some time after at
        the battle of Chester. Then we have the consecration of Mellitus to
        London, as Bishop of the East Saxons, and Justus to Rochester (604
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>); the evangelization of
        the East Saxons by Mellitus; the death of Augustine and succession of
        Laurentius as Archbishop (no date is given; it may have been in 605);
        fresh attempts at union with the Celtic Churches, in which again we
        can perceive a failure of courtesy on the one side met by an
        obstinate pride on the other. The death of Ethelbert in Kent (616
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>) and that of Sabert in
        Essex, soon after, lead to a pagan reaction in both provinces;
        Mellitus and Justus take refuge on the Continent; Laurentius,
        intending to follow them, is stopped by a vision which leads to the
        conversion of King Eadbald and the recovery of Kent for Christianity.
        Essex, however, continues to be pagan. On the death of Laurentius
        (619 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>), Mellitus succeeds to
        Canterbury and is himself succeeded by Justus (in 624). In Chapter 9
        we enter upon a new development of the highest importance in the work
        of the mission. The marriage of Edwin, king of Northumbria, and the
        Kentish princess, Ethelberg, brings about the conversion of
        Northumbria <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxv">[pg
        xxv]</span><a name="Pgxxv" id="Pgxxv" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        through the preaching of Paulinus. The story is told in detail.
        Letters from Pope Boniface to Edwin and his consort are quoted at
        length, Edwin's early history with its bearing on the great crisis of
        his life is related; finally we have the decisive debate in the
        Witenagemot at Goodmanham and the baptism of the king at Easter, 627
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> Through the influence
        of Edwin on Earpwald, king of East Anglia, that province is next
        converted, but on the death of Earpwald the people lapse into
        paganism for three years, till Christianity is finally established by
        the labours of Bishop Felix, under the enlightened King Sigbert, who
        had himself been drawn to the faith in Gaul.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Meanwhile, peace
        and prosperity reign in Northumbria, and Paulinus extends his
        preaching to Lindsey. He re-receives the pall from Pope Honorius, in
        accordance with the original intention of Gregory that the Bishop of
        York should rank as a metropolitan. At Canterbury, Justus is
        succeeded by Archbishop Honorius. Parenthetically we have extracts
        from letters, probably of the year 640 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>, addressed by the Roman
        see to the Irish clergy on the Paschal question and the Pelagian
        heresy.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Chapter 20 we
        have a dramatic climax to the book in the overthrow and death of
        Edwin at the battle of Hatfield in 633 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>; the devastation of
        Northumbria by the British king, Caedwalla, and Penda of Mercia; and
        the flight of Paulinus, taking with him Ethelberg and Eanfled to
        Kent, where he ends his life in charge of the Church of Rochester.
        His work in Northumbria seems for the time, at least, wholly
        overthrown. Only James the Deacon remains heroically at his post to
        keep alive the smouldering embers of the faith.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Book
        III.</span></span>—Book III opens with the story of the apostasy of
        the Northumbrian kings and the miseries of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Hateful Year,”</span> terminated by the victory of
        Oswald at Heavenfield in 634 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> Christianity is brought
        again to Northumbria (635 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>) by the Celtic Mission,
        sent from Iona at the request of Oswald, who nobly co-operates with
        Aidan in the work of evangelization. Aidan fixes his see at
        Lindisfarne. The mention of Iona leads to a short account of the
        mission of St. Columba to the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxvi">[pg xxvi]</span><a name="Pgxxvi" id="Pgxxvi" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Northern Picts in 565 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>, and incidentally of
        St. Ninian's mission to the Southern Picts <span class="tei tei-q">“long before”</span>; the grant of Iona to St. Columba,
        and its constitution, the character of its monks and their error with
        regard to Easter. The characters of Aidan and Oswald are described;
        and the union of Deira and Bernicia under Oswald is briefly
        mentioned.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Chapter 7 we
        pass to a fresh missionary enterprise. Birinus, sent to Britain by
        Pope Honorius, converts the West Saxons. Their king, Cynegils, is
        baptized, and a see is established at Dorchester, in Oxfordshire.
        Under Coinwalch, the successor of Cynegils, the province passes
        through various vicissitudes, political and ecclesiastical, and
        finally the West Saxon see is fixed at Winchester.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Kent,
        Earconbert succeeds Eadbald in 640 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>, and takes vigorous
        measures for the suppression of idolatry. His daughter, Earcongota,
        and many other high-born English ladies enter the religious life in
        Gaul, for convents are still scarce in England.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Chapter 9,
        reverting to the history of Northumbria, Bede tells us of the death
        of Oswald at Maserfelth in 642, and relates at length various
        miracles wrought by his relics. Oswald is succeeded by Oswy in
        Bernicia and in Deira by Oswin. The latter is treacherously murdered
        by Oswy; his character is described. The death of Aidan (in 651)
        immediately follows that of his beloved king; Aidan's miracles are
        related, and a warm tribute is paid to his character, in spite of the
        inevitable error with regard to Easter, which is severely
        condemned.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Chapter 18,
        passing again to East Anglian history, we hear of King Sigbert's
        services to education, and of his retirement to a monastery from
        which he was forcibly drawn to fall in battle against the Mercians.
        (The chronology is here very vague.) A vision of the Irish St. Fursa,
        who founded the monastery of Cnobheresburg in East Anglia is told in
        detail. Changes in the episcopate in East Anglia and elsewhere are
        mentioned. Deusdedit succeeds Honorius as Archbishop of Canterbury in
        654.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again, a
        Northumbrian prince gives a fresh impulse to the spread of
        Christianity. In 653 the Middle Angles <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxvii">[pg xxvii]</span><a name="Pgxxvii" id="Pgxxvii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> (who occupied a part of Mercia) are converted,
        their prince, Peada, being persuaded chiefly by his brother-in-law,
        Alchfrid, a son of Oswy. Four priests are sent to them to preach and
        baptize, Cedd, Adda, Betti, and Diuma, and Diuma becomes bishop of
        the Middle Angles and Mercians. Similarly, at this time, King Sigbert
        of Essex listens to the exhortations of his friend, King Oswy, and,
        at the preaching of Cedd, the East Saxons receive the faith a second
        time. Cedd becomes their bishop. Sigbert's tragic death is related.
        His successor, Suidhelm, receives baptism at the hands of Cedd. The
        foundation of Lastingham by Ethelwald of Deira and its consecration
        by Cedd are described. Cedd dies of the plague of 664.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Meanwhile,
        important political changes have taken place in the north: the defeat
        and death of Penda at the Winwaed in 655 are followed by Oswy's rule,
        which established Christianity in Mercia, in spite of a successful
        rebellion after three years, when the Mercians threw off the yoke of
        Northumbria and set up Penda's son, Wulfhere, as their king.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Chapter 25 we
        come to the Synod of Whitby (664 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>),
        which settled the Easter question for the English Church. Wilfrid
        comes to the front as a champion of the Catholic rules. The opposing
        party either retire or conform. The self-denial and devotion of the
        Celtic missionaries are highly praised, and some account of the life
        led by English students in Ireland follows, with the story of the
        self-dedication of Egbert, who is destined to play a prominent part
        afterwards in the history of the Church.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The consecration
        of both Wilfrid and Ceadda (664 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>), as bishops of
        Northumbria leads to complications in the episcopate. An important
        step towards the unity of the English nation in ecclesiastical
        matters is taken when Wighard is sent to Rome by the kings Oswy and
        Egbert, acting in concert, to be consecrated as Archbishop of
        Canterbury (667 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>). Wighard dies there,
        and Pope Vitalian undertakes to find an archbishop for the English
        Church.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxviii">[pg
        xxviii]</span><a name="Pgxxviii" id="Pgxxviii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The book ends with
        a fresh apostasy in Essex during the miseries of the great plague of
        664. Mercia, so lately itself evangelized, becomes a new missionary
        centre, King Wulfhere sending Bishop Jaruman to recall the East
        Saxons to the faith.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Book
        IV.</span></span>—In all but one of the kingdoms of England
        Christianity is now, at least in name, established, and the Church
        settles down to the work of organization. The man for this task is
        found in Theodore of Tarsus, consecrated Archbishop of the English in
        668. He arrives at Canterbury in 669. We hear at once of the vigorous
        impulse given by him and Abbot Hadrian to the various departments of
        education there. Finding an irregularity in Ceadda's orders, he
        completes his ordination and makes him Bishop of the Mercians
        (probably in 669), with his see at Lichfield. Ceadda's death (672
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>), his character, and
        the miracles and visions connected with him are described.
        Parenthetically we get an account of Colman's activity in Ireland
        after his retirement, in consequence of the decision at Whitby. The
        most important political events at this time are the death of Oswy
        and succession of Egfrid in Northumbria in 670 or 671, and the death
        of Egbert and succession of Hlothere in Kent in 673.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the same year
        the Council of Hertford, the first English provincial council, is
        held, and marks the strength and independence of the Church. Theodore
        proceeds with his reforms in the episcopate. Various events of
        ecclesiastical importance follow; the East Anglian diocese is divided
        about this time, and other changes are effected.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Essex, so long
        prone to lapses into paganism, becomes at this time a centre of
        religious life under its Bishop Earconwald and its king Sebbi.
        Earconwald, whose holiness is attested by many miraculous
        circumstances, was the founder of the monasteries of Chertsey and
        Barking, the latter of which was ruled by his sister, the saintly
        Ethelburg. Various miracles are related in connection with her and
        her monastery. The king of the East Saxons, Sebbi, is a man of
        unusual piety who resigns his kingdom and receives the
        tonsure.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxix">[pg
        xxix]</span><a name="Pgxxix" id="Pgxxix" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After a brief
        allusion to West Saxon history, the devastation of Kent by Ethelred
        of Mercia in 676, and certain changes in the episcopate, we come to
        an important step in the organization of the Church taken by
        Theodore. In pursuance of his policy of increasing the number of
        bishops, he subdivides the great Northumbrian diocese. Wilfrid is
        expelled (678 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>). From these events we
        pass summarily to the evangelization of the South Saxons by Wilfrid,
        who extends his labours to the Isle of Wight, and thus the last of
        the English provinces is won for the faith.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the Council of
        Hatfield (680 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>) the English Church
        asserts its orthodoxy and unites with the continental Churches in
        repudiating the heresy of the Monothelites. Turning to Northumbrian
        history, we have the story of Egfrid's queen, Ethelthryth, and a hymn
        composed in her honour by Bede. The war between Mercia and
        Northumbria in 679 is ended by the mediation of Theodore, and a
        miracle in connection with the battle of the Trent is related.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The remainder of
        the book is occupied mainly with Northumbrian history, the life and
        death of Hilda, Abbess of Whitby, the story of the poet Caedmon, the
        destruction of Coldingham, prophesied by the monk Adamnan, Egfrid's
        invasion of Ireland (684 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>) and of the country of
        the Picts (685 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>), his defeat and death
        in that year, the decline of Northumbria, the flight of Bishop
        Trumwine from Abercorn, and the succession of Aldfrid to the kingdom.
        The death of Hlothere of Kent (685 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>) is followed by anarchy
        in that province, till Wictred succeeds and restores peace.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Chapters 27-32
        we have an account of the life of St. Cuthbert and stories of the
        miracles wrought by his relics.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Book
        V.</span></span>—Book V opens with the story of the holy Ethelwald,
        who succeeded Cuthbert as anchorite at Farne, and a miracle wrought
        through his intercession. This is followed (cc. 2-6) by an account of
        John of Beverley, Bishop of Hexham, and the miracles attributed to
        him. In Chapter 7 we have a piece of West Saxon <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxx">[pg xxx]</span><a name="Pgxxx" id="Pgxxx" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> history: Caedwalla, King of Wessex, after
        a life of war and bloodshed, goes to Rome to receive baptism there,
        and dies immediately after his admission into the Church (689
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>). He is succeeded by
        Ini, who in 725 likewise ended his days at Rome.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In 690 Theodore
        dies, after an episcopate of twenty-two years. Bertwald succeeds him
        at Canterbury in 693.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At this time
        Englishmen begin to extend their missionary enterprise abroad.
        Various missions are undertaken by men who have lived long in Ireland
        and caught the Celtic zeal for the work of evangelization. The story
        is told of the attempted mission of Egbert to Germany and the
        unsuccessful venture of Witbert. Wilbrord (in 690) and others plant
        the faith among the German tribes.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The vision of
        Drythelm is inserted here, probably on chronological grounds
        (<span class="tei tei-q">“his temporibus”</span>), and other visions
        of the future world follow.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Apparently about
        the same time a change is effected in the attitude of the greater
        part of the Celtic Church towards the Paschal question. The Northern
        Irish are converted to the Roman usages by Adamnan, Abbot of Iona,
        whose book on the <span class="tei tei-q">“Holy Places”</span> is
        here described (cc. 16-17).</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The death of
        Aldfrid and succession of Osred in Northumbria in 705 are the next
        events narrated.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">About this time
        the division of the West Saxon diocese is carried out, Aldhelm being
        appointed to Sherborne and Daniel to Winchester; the South Saxons
        receive a bishop of their own for the first time. In 709 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> Coenred of Mercia and
        Offa of Essex receive the tonsure at Rome, and in the same year
        Bishop Wilfrid dies. The story of his life is told.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Not long after,
        Hadrian dies and is succeeded by Albinus as Abbot of St. Augustine's.
        Bede's friend, Acca, succeeds Wilfrid as Bishop of Hexham. His
        services to the Church are enumerated.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">An important step
        is taken at this time by the Northern Picts in the acceptance of the
        Roman rules with regard to Easter and the tonsure. The letter of
        Abbot Ceolfrid of Wearmouth and Jarrow to the Pictish king Naiton
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxxi">[pg xxxi]</span><a name="Pgxxxi" id="Pgxxxi" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> on this subject is
        quoted at length. Soon after, Iona yields to the preaching of Egbert,
        and receives the Catholic usages. Egbert dies in 729. In Chapter 23 a
        number of events are briefly mentioned; the death of Wictred of Kent
        in 725, and the succession of his sons, the death of the learned
        Tobias, Bishop of Rochester, in 726, the appearance of two comets in
        729, followed by the devastation of Gaul by the Saracens, the death
        of the Northumbrian king Osric, and succession of Ceolwulf in 729;
        finally, the death of Archbishop Bertwald in 731 and the succession
        of Tatwine. Then follows an account of the state of the English
        episcopate in 731, the year in which Bede finished the History. The
        relations of the English with Picts, Scots, and Britons are
        described, and some allusion is made to the growth of monasticism in
        this time of external peace.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The book closes in
        Chapter 24 with a chronological summary of the whole work, an

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Few lives afford
        less material for the biographer than Bede's; few seem to possess a
        more irresistible fascination. Often as the simple story has been
        told, the desire to tell it afresh appears to be perennial. And yet
        it is perhaps as wholly devoid of incident as any life could be. The
        short autobiographical sketch at the end of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Ecclesiastical History”</span> tells us practically all:
        that he was born in the territory of the twin monastery of Wearmouth
        and Jarrow; that at the age of seven he was sent by his kinsfolk to
        be brought up, first under the Abbot Benedict, afterwards under
        Ceolfrid; that in his nineteenth year (the canonical age was
        twenty-five) he was admitted to the diaconate, and received priest's
        orders in his thirtieth year, in both instances at the hands of John,
        Bishop of Hexham, and by order of the Abbot Ceolfrid; that he spent
        his whole life in the monastery in learning, in teaching, and in
        writing, and in the observance of the monastic rule and attendance at
        the daily services of the Church. Of his family we know nothing; the
        name Beda appears to have been not uncommon. The fact that he was
        handed over by kinsmen (<span class="tei tei-q">“cura
        propinquorum”</span>) to Abbot Benedict would seem to imply that he
        was an orphan when he entered the monastery at the age of seven, but
        it was not unusual for parents to dedicate their infant children to
        the religious life, in many cases even at an earlier age than Bede's.
        We may compare the story of the little boy, Aesica, at Barking,
        related by Bede, and of Elfled, the daughter of Oswy, dedicated by
        her father before she was a year old.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxxiv">[pg xxxiv]</span><a name="Pgxxxiv" id="Pgxxxiv" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The epithet
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Venerable,”</span> commonly attached to his
        name, has given rise to more than one legend. It was apparently first
        applied to him in the ninth century, and is said to have been an
        appellation of priests. The best known of these legends is Fuller's
        story of a certain <span class="tei tei-q">“dunce monk”</span> who
        set about writing Bede's epitaph, and being unable to complete the
        verse, <span class="tei tei-q">“Hic sunt in fossa Bedae ...
        ossa,”</span> went to bed with his task unfinished. Returning to it
        in the morning, he found that an angel had filled the gap with the
        word <span class="tei tei-q">“venerabilis.”</span> Another account
        tells how Bede, in his old age, when his eyes were dim, was induced
        by certain <span class="tei tei-q">“mockers”</span> to preach, under
        the mistaken belief that the people were assembled to hear him. As he
        ended his sermon with a solemn invocation of the Trinity, the angels
        (in one version it is the stones of a rocky valley) responded
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Amen, very venerable Bede.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The land on which
        Bede was born was granted by Egfrid to Benedict Biscop for the
        foundation of the monasteries a short time after the birth of Bede.
        Wearmouth was founded in 674, Jarrow in 681 or 682. Bede was among
        those members of the community who were transferred to Jarrow under
        Abbot Ceolfrid, and under his rule and that of his successor,
        Huaetbert, he passed his life. With regard to the chief dates, the
        authorities differ, Simeon of Durham and others placing his birth as
        late as 677. Bede himself tells us that he was in his fifty-ninth
        year when he wrote the short autobiography at the end of the History.
        That work was finished in 731, and there seems to be no good reason
        to suppose that the autobiographical sketch was written at a later
        time. We may infer then that he was born in 673, that he was ordained
        deacon in 691 and priest in 702. For his death, 735, the date given
        in the <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#Continuation" class="tei tei-ref"><span class="tei tei-q">“Continuation,”</span></a> seems to be supported by the
        evidence of the letter of Cuthbert to Cuthwin (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">v.
        infra</span></span>). From this it appears that he died on a
        Wednesday, which nevertheless is called Ascension Day, implying,
        doubtless, that his death occurred on the eve, after the festival had
        begun, according to ecclesiastical reckoning. It is further explained
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxxv">[pg xxxv]</span><a name="Pgxxxv" id="Pgxxxv" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> that Ascension Day
        was on the 26th of May (<span class="tei tei-q">“VII Kal.
        Junii”</span>),<a id="noteref_1" name="noteref_1" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_1"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1</span></span></a> which was
        actually the case in the year 735.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Beyond the
        testimony borne to his exceptional diligence as a student in a letter
        from Alcuin to the monks of Wearmouth and Jarrow, we hear nothing of
        his childhood and early youth. One anecdote in the Anonymous History
        of the Abbots may perhaps refer to him, though no name is given. It
        tells how, when the plague of 686 devastated the monastery, the Abbot
        Ceolfrid, for lack of fit persons to assist at the daily offices,
        decided to recite the psalms without antiphons, except at vespers and
        matins. But after a week's trial, unable to bear it any longer, he
        restored the antiphons to their proper place, and with the help of
        one little boy carried on the services in the usual manner. This
        little boy is described as being, at the time the History was
        written, a priest of that monastery who <span class="tei tei-q">“duly, both by his words and writings, commends the
        Abbot's praiseworthy deeds to all who seek to know them,”</span> and
        he has generally been supposed to be Bede.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Ecclesiastical History”</span> (IV, 3) there
        is an allusion to Bede's teachers, one of whom, Trumbert, educated at
        Lastingham under Ceadda, is mentioned by name. The monastery of
        Wearmouth and Jarrow must have offered exceptional facilities for
        study. Benedict had enriched it with many treasures which he brought
        with him from his travels. Chief among these was the famous library
        which he founded and which was enlarged by Abbot Ceolfrid. Here Bede
        acquired that wide and varied learning revealed in his historical,
        scientific, and theological works. He studied with particular care
        and reverence the patristic writings; his theological treatises were,
        as he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“compiled out of the works of the
        venerable Fathers.”</span> He must have had a considerable
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxxvi">[pg xxxvi]</span><a name="Pgxxxvi" id="Pgxxxvi" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> knowledge of
        Greek, probably he knew some Hebrew. Though he is not wholly free
        from the mediaeval churchman's distrust of pagan authors, he
        constantly betrays his acquaintance with them, and the sense of form
        which must unconsciously influence the student of classical
        literature has passed into his own writings and preserved him from
        the barbarism of monkish Latin. His style is singularly clear,
        simple, and fluent, as free from obscurity as from affectation and
        bombast.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus was the
        foundation laid of that sound learning upon which his widespread
        influence both as a teacher and writer was reared. <span class="tei tei-q">“I always took delight,”</span> he tells us, <span class="tei tei-q">“in learning, or teaching, or writing.”</span> Probably
        his writing was, as is so often the case, the outcome of his
        teaching; his object in both is to meet <span class="tei tei-q">“the
        needs of the brethren.”</span> One of his pupils was Archbishop
        Egbert, the founder of the school of York, which gave a fresh impulse
        to learning, not only in England, but through Alcuin in France, at a
        time when a revival was most to be desired.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was to Egbert
        that he paid one of the only two visits which he records. In the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Epistola ad Ecgbertum”</span> he alludes to
        a short stay he had made with him the year before, and declines, on
        account of the illness which proved to be his last, an invitation to
        visit him again. He visited Lindisfarne in connection with his task
        of writing the life of Cuthbert. Otherwise we have no authentic
        record of any absence from the monastery. The story that he went to
        Rome at the request of Pope Sergius, founded on a statement of
        William of Malmesbury, is now regarded as highly improbable. The
        oldest MS. of the letter of Sergius, requesting Ceolfrid to send one
        of his monks to Rome, has no mention of the name of Bede. If such an
        event had ever disturbed his accustomed course of life, it is
        inconceivable that he should nowhere allude to it. Still less is the
        assertion that he lived and taught at Cambridge one which need be
        seriously debated by the present generation.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We may fairly
        assume that, except for a few short absences such as the visits to
        York and Lindisfarne, his <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxxvii">[pg xxxvii]</span><a name="Pgxxxvii" id="Pgxxxvii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> whole life was spent in the monastery. It
        must have been a life of unremitting toil. His writings, numerous as
        they are, covering a wide range of subjects and involving the
        severest study, can only have been a part of his work; he had,
        besides, his duties as priest, teacher, and member of a religious
        community to fulfil. Even the manual labour of his literary work must
        have been considerable. He did not employ an amanuensis, and he had
        not the advantages with regard to copyists which a member of one of
        the larger monasteries might have had. <span class="tei tei-q">“Ipse
        mihi dictator simul notarius (= shorthand writer) et librarius (=
        copyist),”</span> he writes. Yet he never flags. Through all the
        outward monotony of his days his own interest remains fresh. He
        <span class="tei tei-q">“takes delight”</span> (<span class="tei tei-q">“dulce habui”</span>) in it all. It is a life full of
        eager activity in intellectual things, of a keen and patriotic
        interest in the wider life beyond the monastery walls, which shows
        itself sadly enough in his reflections on the evils of the times, of
        the ardent charity which spends itself in labour for the brethren,
        and, pervading the whole, that spirit of quiet obedience and devotion
        which his own simple words describe as <span class="tei tei-q">“the
        observance of monastic rule and the daily charge of singing in the
        Church.”</span> We can picture him, at the appointed hours, breaking
        off his absorbing occupations to take his place at the daily offices,
        lest, as he believed, he should fail to meet the angels there. Alcuin
        records a saying of his, <span class="tei tei-q">“I know that angels
        visit the canonical hours and the congregations of the brethren. What
        if they do not find me among the brethren? May they not say,
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘Where is Bede?’</span> ”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is probably
        here, in this harmony of work and devotion, that we may find the
        secret of the fascination in the record of his uneventful days. It
        reconciles the sharp antithesis between the active and the
        contemplative life. It seems to attain to that ideal of <span class="tei tei-q">“toil unsever'd from tranquillity”</span> which haunts us
        all, but which we have almost ceased to associate with the life of
        man under present conditions. Balance, moderation, or rather, that
        rare quality which has been well called <span class="tei tei-q">“the
        sanity of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxxviii">[pg
        xxxviii]</span><a name="Pgxxxviii" id="Pgxxxviii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> saintliness,”</span><a id="noteref_2" name="noteref_2" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_2"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2</span></span></a> these
        give a unity to the life of Bede and preserve him from the
        exaggerations of the conventual ideal. With all his admiration for
        the ascetic life, he recognizes human limitations. It is cheering to
        find that even he felt the need of a holiday. <span class="tei tei-q">“Having completed,”</span> he writes, <span class="tei tei-q">“the third book of the Commentary on Samuel, I thought I
        would rest awhile, and, after recovering in that way my delight in
        study and writing, proceed to take in hand the fourth.”</span>
        Intellectual power commands his homage, but his mind is open to the
        appreciation of all forms of excellence. It is the unlearned brother,
        unfit for study and occupied in manual labour, to whom, in his story,
        it is vouchsafed to hear the singing of the angels who came to summon
        Ceadda to his rest. The life of devotion ranks highest in his
        estimation, but he records with approval how St. Cuthbert thought
        <span class="tei tei-q">“that to afford the weak brethren the help of
        his exhortation stood in the stead of prayer, knowing that He Who
        said <span class="tei tei-q">‘Thou shalt love the Lord thy
        God,’</span> said likewise, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Thou shalt love
        thy neighbour as thyself.’</span> ”</span> He tells us how St.
        Gregory bewailed his own loss in being forced by his office to be
        entangled in worldly affairs. <span class="tei tei-q">“But,”</span>
        adds the human-hearted biographer, <span class="tei tei-q">“it
        behoves us to believe that he lost nothing of his monastic perfection
        by reason of his pastoral charge, but rather that he gained greater
        profit through the labour of converting many, than by the former calm
        of his private life.”</span> Yet he holds that this immunity from the
        evil influence of the world was chiefly due to Gregory's care in
        organizing his house like a monastery and safeguarding the
        opportunities for prayer and devotional study, even while he was
        immersed in affairs at the court of Constantinople, and afterwards,
        when he held the most onerous office in the Church.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This quality of
        sanity shows itself again in an unusual degree of fairness to
        opponents. The Paschal error, indeed, moves his indignation in a
        manner which is incomprehensible <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxxix">[pg xxxix]</span><a name="Pgxxxix" id="Pgxxxix" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and distasteful to the modern reader, but even
        in the perverse and erring Celts he can recognize <span class="tei tei-q">“a zeal of God, though not according to
        knowledge.”</span> Aidan's holiness of life wins from him a warm
        tribute of admiration. In the monks of Iona, the stronghold of the
        Celtic system, he can perceive the fruit of good works and find an
        excuse for their error in their isolated situation. In the British
        Church it is the lack of missionary zeal, rather than their attitude
        towards the Easter question, which calls forth his strongest
        condemnation.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A characteristic
        akin to this is his love of truth. As a historian, it shows itself in
        his scrupulous care in investigating evidence and in acknowledging
        the sources from which he draws. Nowhere is his intellectual honesty
        more apparent than in dealing with what he believes to be the
        miraculous element in his history. In whatever way we may regard
        these anecdotes, there can be no doubt that Bede took the utmost
        pains to assure himself of their authenticity. He is careful to
        acquire, if possible, first-hand evidence; where this cannot be
        obtained, he scrupulously mentions the lack of it. He admits only the
        testimony of witnesses of high character and generally quotes them by
        name.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These are but a
        few of the glimpses afforded us of the personality of Bede, a
        personality never obtruded, but everywhere unconsciously revealed in
        his work. Everywhere we find the impress of a mind of wide
        intellectual grasp, a character of the highest saintliness, and a
        gentle refinement of thought and feeling. The lofty spirituality of
        Bede, his great learning and scholarly attainment are the more
        striking when we reflect how recently his nation had emerged from
        barbarism and received Christianity and the culture which it brought
        with it to these shores.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The letter in
        which he declines Egbert's invitation on the plea of illness is dated
        November, 734. If we may assume that his death took place on the eve
        of Ascension Day in 735, no long period of enfeebled health clouded
        the close of his life, and weakness never interrupted his work. His
        death has been described by his pupil, Cuthbert, who afterwards
        became Abbot of Wearmouth and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexl">[pg xl]</span><a name="Pgxl" id="Pgxl" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Jarrow in succession to Huaetbert, in the
        letter quoted below. He was first buried at Jarrow but, according to
        Simeon of Durham, his relics were stolen by the priest, Elfred, and
        carried to Durham. In 1104, when the bones of Cuthbert were
        translated to the new Cathedral, those of Bede were found with them.
        Not long after, Hugh de Puisac erected a shrine of gold and silver,
        adorned with jewels, in which he placed them, along with the relics
        of many other saints. The shrine disappeared at the Reformation, and
        only the stone on which it rested remains.<a id="noteref_3" name="noteref_3" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_3"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3</span></span></a></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“To his fellow-lector, Cuthwin, beloved in Christ,
          Cuthbert, his fellow-student, greeting and salvation for ever in
          the Lord. I have very gladly received the gift which thou sentest
          to me, and with much joy have read thy devout and learned letter,
          wherein I found that which I greatly desired, to wit, that masses
          and holy prayers are diligently offered by you for our father and
          master Bede, beloved of God. Wherefore I rejoice, rather for love
          of him than from confidence in my own power, to relate in few words
          after what manner he departed out of this world, understanding also
          that thou hast desired and asked this of me. He was troubled with
          weakness and chiefly with difficulty in breathing, yet almost
          without pain, for about a fortnight before the day of our Lord's
          Resurrection; and thus he afterwards passed his time, cheerful and
          rejoicing, giving thanks to Almighty God every day and night, nay,
          every hour, till the day of our Lord's Ascension, to wit, the
          twenty-sixth day of May, and daily gave lessons to us, his
          disciples; and whatsoever remained of the day he spent in singing
          psalms, as far as he was able; he also strove to pass all the night
          joyfully in prayer and thanksgiving to God, save only when a short
          sleep prevented it; and then he no sooner awoke than he straightway
          began again to repeat the well-known sacred songs, and ceased not
          to give thanks <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexli">[pg
          xli]</span><a name="Pgxli" id="Pgxli" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          to God with uplifted hands. I declare with truth that I have never
          seen with my eyes, or heard with my ears, any man so earnest in
          giving thanks to the living God. O truly blessed man! He repeated
          the words of St. Paul the Apostle, <span class="tei tei-q">‘It is a
          fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God,’</span> and
          much more out of Holy Scripture; wherein also he admonished us to
          think of our last hour, and to arise out of the sleep of the soul;
          and being learned in our native poetry, he said also in our tongue,
          concerning the dread parting of souls from the body:</span></p>

          interpreted is: <span class="tei tei-q">“Before the inevitable
          journey hence, no man is wiser than is needful that he may
          consider, ere the soul departs, what good or evil it hath done and

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“He also sang antiphons for our comfort and his own.
          One of these is, <span class="tei tei-q">‘O King of Glory, Lord of
          all power, Who, triumphing this day, didst ascend above all the
          heavens, leave us not comfortless, but send to us the promise of
          the Father, even the Spirit of Truth—Hallelujah.’</span> And when
          he came to the words, <span class="tei tei-q">‘leave us not
          comfortless,’</span> he burst into tears and wept much. And an hour
          after, he fell to repeating what he had begun. And this he did the
          whole day, and we, hearing it, mourned with him and wept. Now we
          read and now we lamented, nay, we wept even as we read. In such
          rapture we passed the fifty days' festival<a id="noteref_4" name="noteref_4" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_4"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">4</span></span></a> till
          the aforesaid day; and he rejoiced greatly and gave God thanks,
          because he had been accounted worthy to suffer such weakness. And
          he often said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘God scourgeth every son
          whom He <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexlii">[pg
          xlii]</span><a name="Pgxlii" id="Pgxlii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> receiveth’</span>; and the words of St.
          Ambrose, <span class="tei tei-q">‘I have not so lived as to be
          ashamed to live among you; but neither do I fear to die, because we
          have a merciful Lord.’</span> And during those days, besides the
          lessons we had daily from him, and the singing of the Psalms, there
          were two memorable works, which he strove to finish; to wit, his
          translation of the Gospel of St. John, from the beginning, as far
          as the words, <span class="tei tei-q">‘But what are they among so
          many?’</span> into our own tongue, for the benefit of the Church of
          God; and some selections from the books of Bishop Isidore, saying,
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘I would not have my boys read a lie, nor
          labour herein without profit after my death.’</span></span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“When the Tuesday before the Ascension of our Lord
          came, he began to suffer still more in his breathing, and there was
          some swelling in his feet. But he went on teaching all that day and
          dictating cheerfully, and now and then said among other things,
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘Learn quickly, I know not how long I shall
          endure, and whether my Maker will not soon take me away.’</span>
          But to us it seemed that haply he knew well the time of his
          departure; and so he spent the night, awake, in giving of thanks.
          And when the morning dawned, that is, on the Wednesday, he bade us
          write with all speed what we had begun. And this we did until the
          third hour. And from the third hour we walked in procession with
          the relics of the saints, according to the custom of that
          day.<a id="noteref_5" name="noteref_5" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_5"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">5</span></span></a> And
          there was one of us with him who said to him, <span class="tei tei-q">‘There is still one chapter wanting of the book which
          thou hast been dictating, but I deem it burdensome for thee to be
          questioned any further.’</span> He answered, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Nay, it is light, take thy pen and make ready, and
          write quickly.’</span> And this was done. But at the ninth hour he
          said to me, <span class="tei tei-q">‘I have certain treasures in my
          coffer, some spices, napkins and incense; run quickly and bring the
          priests of our monastery to me, that I may distribute among them
          the gifts which God has bestowed on me.’</span> And this I did
          trembling, and when they were come, he spoke to every one of them,
          admonishing and entreating them <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexliii">[pg xliii]</span><a name="Pgxliii" id="Pgxliii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> that they should diligently offer masses and
          prayers for him, and they promised readily. But they all mourned
          and wept, sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake,
          because they thought that they should see his face no long time in
          this world. But they rejoiced for that he said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘It is time for me, if it be my Maker's will, to be set
          free from the flesh, and come to Him Who, when as yet I was not,
          formed me out of nothing. I have lived long; and well has my
          pitiful judge disposed my life for me; the time of my release is at
          hand; for my soul longs to see Christ my King in His
          beauty.’</span> Having said this and much more for our profit and
          edification, he passed his last day in gladness till the evening;
          and the aforesaid boy, whose name was Wilbert, still said,
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘Dear master, there is yet one sentence not
          written.’</span> He answered, <span class="tei tei-q">‘It is well,
          write it.’</span> Soon after, the boy said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Now it is written.’</span> And he said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘It is well, thou hast said truly, it is finished. Take
          my head in thy hands, for I rejoice greatly to sit facing my holy
          place where I was wont to pray, that I too, sitting there, may call
          upon my Father.’</span> And thus on the pavement of his little
          cell, chanting <span class="tei tei-q">‘Glory be to the Father, and
          to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost,’</span> and the rest, he
          breathed his last.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“And without doubt we must believe that inasmuch as he
          had always been devout and earnest on earth in the praise of God,
          his soul was carried by angels to the joys of Heaven which he
          desired. And all who heard him or beheld the death of our father
          Bede, said that they had never seen any other end his life in so
          great devotion and peace. For, as thou hast heard, so long as the
          soul abode in the body, he chanted the <span class="tei tei-q">‘Gloria Patri’</span> and other words to the glory of
          God, and with outstretched hands ceased not to give thanks to
          God.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“But know this, that much could be told and written
          concerning him, but my want of learning cuts short my words.
          Nevertheless, with the help of God, I purpose at leisure to write
          more fully concerning him, of those things which I saw with my own
          eyes and heard with my own ears.”</span></p>

        your request, most readily sent to you the Ecclesiastical History of
        the English Nation, which I had lately published, for you to read and
        judge; and I now send it again to be transcribed, and more fully
        studied at your leisure. And I rejoice greatly at the sincerity and
        zeal, with which you not only diligently give ear to hear the words
        of Holy Scripture, but also industriously take care to become
        acquainted with the actions and sayings of former men of renown,
        especially of our own nation. For if history relates good things of
        good men, the attentive hearer is excited to imitate that which is
        good; or if it recounts evil things of wicked persons, none the less
        the conscientious and devout hearer or reader, shunning that which is
        hurtful and wrong, is the more earnestly fired to perform those
        things which he knows to be good, and worthy of the service of God.
        And as you have carefully marked this, you are desirous that the said
        history should be more fully made known to yourself, and to those
        over whom the Divine Authority has appointed you governor, from your
        great regard to the common good. But to the end that I may remove all
        occasion of doubting what I have written, both from <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page002">[pg 002]</span><a name="Pg002" id="Pg002" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> yourself and other readers or hearers of
        this history, I will take care briefly to show you from what authors
        I chiefly learned the same.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">My principal
        authority and aid in this work was the most learned and reverend

        transmitted to me by Nothelm,<a id="noteref_10" name="noteref_10" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_10"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">10</span></span></a> the
        pious priest of the Church of London, either in writing, or by word
        of mouth of the same Nothelm, all that he thought worthy of memory
        that had been done in the province of Kent, or the adjacent parts, by
        the disciples of the blessed Pope Gregory,<a id="noteref_11" name="noteref_11" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_11"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">11</span></span></a> as he
        had learned the same either from written records, or the traditions
        of his predecessors. The same Nothelm, afterwards went to Rome, and
        having, with leave of the present Pope Gregory,<a id="noteref_12" name="noteref_12" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_12"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">12</span></span></a> searched
        into the archives of the Holy Roman Church, found there some epistles
        of the blessed Pope Gregory, and other popes; and, returning home, by
        the advice of the aforesaid most reverend father Albinus, brought
        them to me, to be inserted in my history. Thus, from the beginning of
        this volume to the time when the English nation received the faith of
        Christ, we have acquired matter from the writings of former men,
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page003">[pg 003]</span><a name="Pg003" id="Pg003" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> gathered from various sources;
        but from that time till the present, what was transacted in the
        Church of Canterbury by the disciples of the blessed Pope Gregory or
        their successors, and under what kings the same happened, has been
        conveyed to us, as we have said, by Nothelm through the industry of
        the aforesaid Abbot Albinus. They also partly informed me by what
        bishops and under what kings the provinces of the East and West
        Saxons, as also of the East Angles, and of the Northumbrians,
        received the grace of the Gospel. In short, I was chiefly encouraged
        to undertake this work by the exhortations of the same Albinus. In
        like manner, Daniel,<a id="noteref_13" name="noteref_13" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_13"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">13</span></span></a> the most
        reverend Bishop of the West Saxons, who is still living, communicated
        to me in writing some things relating to the Ecclesiastical History
        of that province, and the adjoining one of the South Saxons, as also
        of the Isle of Wight. But how, by the ministry of those holy priests
        of Christ, Cedd<a id="noteref_14" name="noteref_14" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_14"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">14</span></span></a> and

        province of the Mercians was brought to the faith of Christ, which
        they knew not before, and how that of the East Saxons recovered the

        what ecclesiastical matters took place in the province of the East
        Angles, was partly made known to us from the writings and tradition
        of former men, and partly by the account of the most reverend Abbot
        Esi.<a id="noteref_17" name="noteref_17" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_17"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">17</span></span></a> What was
        done with regard to the faith of Christ, and what was the episcopal
        succession in the province of Lindsey,<a id="noteref_18" name="noteref_18" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_18"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">18</span></span></a> we had

        word of mouth from other persons of good credit. But what was done in
        the Church in the different parts of the province of Northumbria from
        the time when they received the faith of Christ till this present, I
        received not on the authority of any one man, but by the faithful
        testimony of innumerable witnesses, who might know or remember the
        same; besides what I had of my own knowledge. Wherein it is to be
        observed, that what I have written concerning our most holy father,
        Bishop Cuthbert,<a id="noteref_20" name="noteref_20" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_20"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">20</span></span></a> either
        in this volume, or in my account of his life and actions, I partly
        took from what I found written of him by the brethren of the Church
        of Lindisfarne,<a id="noteref_21" name="noteref_21" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_21"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">21</span></span></a>
        accepting without reserve the statements I found there; but at the
        same time took care to add such things as I could myself have
        knowledge of by the faithful testimony of trustworthy informants. And
        I humbly entreat the reader, that if he shall find in these our
        writings anything not delivered according to the truth, he will not
        lay the blame of it on me, for, as the true rule of history requires,
        withholding nothing, I have laboured to commit to writing such things
        as I could gather from common report, for the instruction of
        posterity.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Moreover, I
        beseech all men who shall hear or read this history of our nation,
        that for my infirmities both of mind and body, they will offer up
        frequent intercessions to the throne of Grace. And I further pray,
        that in recompense for the labour wherewith I have recorded in the
        several provinces and more important places those events which I
        considered worthy of note and of interest to their inhabitants, I may
        for my reward have the benefit of their pious prayers.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Britain, an
          island in the Atlantic, formerly called Albion, lies to the
          north-west, facing, though at a considerable distance, the coasts
          of Germany, France, and Spain, which form the greatest part of
          Europe. It extends 800 miles in length towards the north, and is
          200 miles in breadth, except where several promontories extend
          further in breadth, by which its compass is made to be 4,875
          miles.<a id="noteref_22" name="noteref_22" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_22"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">22</span></span></a> To the
          south lies Belgic Gaul. To its nearest shore there is an easy
          passage from the city of Rutubi Portus, by the English now
          corrupted into Reptacaestir.<a id="noteref_23" name="noteref_23" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_23"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">23</span></span></a> The

          nearest shore in the territory of the Morini,<a id="noteref_25" name="noteref_25" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_25"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">25</span></span></a> is
          fifty miles, or as some writers say, 450 furlongs. On the other
          side of the island, where it opens upon the boundless ocean, it has
          the islands called Orcades. Britain is rich in grain and trees, and
          is well adapted for feeding cattle and beasts of burden. It also
          produces vines in some places, and has plenty of land and water
          fowl of divers sorts; it is remarkable also for rivers abounding in
          fish, and plentiful springs. It has the greatest plenty of salmon
          and eels; seals are also frequently taken, and dolphins, as also
          whales; besides many sorts of shell-fish, such as mussels, in which
          are often found excellent pearls of all colours, red, purple,
          violet and green, but chiefly white. There is also a great
          abundance of snails, of which the scarlet dye is made, a most
          beautiful red, which never fades with the heat of the sun or
          exposure to rain, but the older it is, the more beautiful it
          becomes. It has both salt and hot <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page006">[pg 006]</span><a name="Pg006" id="Pg006" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> springs, and from them flow rivers which
          furnish hot baths, proper for all ages and both sexes, in separate
          places, according to their requirements. For water, as St. Basil
          says,<a id="noteref_26" name="noteref_26" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_26"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">26</span></span></a>
          receives the quality of heat, when it runs along certain metals,
          and becomes not only hot but scalding. Britain is rich also in
          veins of metals, as copper, iron, lead, and silver; it produces a
          great deal of excellent jet, which is black and sparkling, and
          burns when put to the fire, and when set on fire, drives away
          serpents; being warmed with rubbing, it attracts whatever is
          applied to it, like amber. The island was formerly distinguished by
          twenty-eight famous cities, besides innumerable forts, which were
          all strongly secured with walls, towers, gates, and bars. And,
          because it lies almost under the North Pole, the nights are light
          in summer, so that at midnight the beholders are often in doubt
          whether the evening twilight still continues, or that of the
          morning has come; since the sun at night returns to the east in the
          northern regions without passing far beneath the earth. For this
          reason the days are of a great length in summer, and on the other
          hand, the nights in winter are eighteen hours long, for the sun
          then withdraws into southern parts. In like manner the nights are
          very short in summer, and the days in winter, that is, only six
          equinoctial hours. Whereas, in Armenia, Macedonia, Italy, and other
          countries of the same latitude, the longest day or night extends
          but to fifteen hours, and the shortest to nine.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There are in the
          island at present, following the number of the books in which the
          Divine Law was written, five<a id="noteref_27" name="noteref_27" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_27"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">27</span></span></a>
          languages of different nations employed in the study and confession
          of the one self-same knowledge, which is of highest truth and true
          sublimity, to wit, English, British, Scottish, Pictish, and Latin,
          the last having become common to all by the study of the
          Scriptures. But at first this island had no other inhabitants but
          the Britons, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page007">[pg
          007]</span><a name="Pg007" id="Pg007" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          from whom it derived its name, and who, coming over into Britain,
          as is reported, from Armorica,<a id="noteref_28" name="noteref_28" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_28"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">28</span></span></a>
          possessed themselves of the southern parts thereof. Starting from
          the south, they had occupied the greater part of the island, when
          it happened, that the nation of the Picts, putting to sea from
          Scythia,<a id="noteref_29" name="noteref_29" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_29"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">29</span></span></a> as is
          reported, in a few ships of war, and being driven by the winds
          beyond the bounds of Britain, came to Ireland and landed on its
          northern shores. There, finding the nation of the Scots, they
          begged to be allowed to settle among them, but could not succeed in
          obtaining their request. Ireland is the largest island next to
          Britain, and lies to the west of it; but as it is shorter than
          Britain to the north, so, on the other hand, it runs out far beyond
          it to the south, over against the northern part of Spain, though a
          wide sea lies between them. The Picts then, as has been said,
          arriving in this island by sea, desired to have a place granted
          them in which they might settle. The Scots answered that the island
          could not contain them both; but <span class="tei tei-q">“We can
          give you good counsel,”</span> said they, <span class="tei tei-q">“whereby you may know what to do; we know there is
          another island, not far from ours, to the eastward, which we often
          see at a distance, when the days are clear. If you will go thither,
          you can obtain settlements; or, if any should oppose you, we will
          help you.”</span> The Picts, accordingly, sailing over into
          Britain, began to inhabit the northern parts <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page008">[pg 008]</span><a name="Pg008" id="Pg008" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> thereof, for the Britons had possessed
          themselves of the southern. Now the Picts had no wives, and asked
          them of the Scots; who would not consent to grant them upon any
          other terms, than that when any question should arise, they should
          choose a king from the female royal race rather than from the male:
          which custom, as is well known, has been observed among the Picts
          to this day.<a id="noteref_30" name="noteref_30" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_30"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">30</span></span></a> In
          process of time, Britain, besides the Britons and the Picts,
          received a third nation, the Scots, who, migrating from Ireland
          under their leader, Reuda, either by fair means, or by force of
          arms, secured to themselves those settlements among the Picts which
          they still possess. From the name of their commander, they are to
          this day called Dalreudini; for, in their language, Dal signifies a
          part.<a id="noteref_31" name="noteref_31" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_31"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">31</span></span></a></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Ireland is
          broader than Britain and has a much healthier and milder climate;
          for the snow scarcely ever lies there above three days: no man
          makes hay in the summer for winter's provision, or builds stables
          for his beasts of burden. No reptiles are found there, and no snake
          can live there; for, though snakes are often carried thither out of
          Britain, as soon as the ship comes near the shore, and the scent of
          the air reaches them, they die. On the contrary, almost all things
          in the island are efficacious against poison. In truth, we have
          known that when men have been bitten by serpents, the scrapings of
          leaves of books that were brought out of Ireland, being put into
          water, and given them to drink, have immediately absorbed the
          spreading poison, and assuaged the swelling.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page009">[pg 009]</span><a name="Pg009" id="Pg009" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The island
          abounds in milk and honey, nor is there any lack of vines, fish, or
          fowl; and it is noted for the hunting of stags and roe-deer. It is
          properly the country of the Scots, who, migrating from thence, as
          has been said, formed the third nation in Britain in addition to
          the Britons and the Picts.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is a very
          large gulf of the sea, which formerly divided the nation of the
          Britons from the Picts; it runs from the west far into the land,
          where, to this day, stands a strong city of the Britons, called
          Alcluith.<a id="noteref_32" name="noteref_32" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_32"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">32</span></span></a> The

          the first Roman that came into Britain.</span></h2>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now Britain had
          never been visited by the Romans, and was entirely unknown to them
          before the time of Caius Julius Caesar, who, in the year 693 after
          the foundation of Rome, but the sixtieth year<a id="noteref_33" name="noteref_33" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_33"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">33</span></span></a> before
          the Incarnation of our Lord, was consul with Lucius Bibulus. While
          he was making war upon the Germans and the Gauls, who were divided
          only by the river Rhine, he came into the province of the Morini,
          whence is the nearest and shortest passage into Britain. Here,
          having provided about eighty ships of burden and fast-sailing
          vessels, he sailed over into Britain; where, being first roughly
          handled in a battle, and then caught in a storm, he lost a
          considerable part of his fleet, no small number of foot-soldiers,
          and almost all his cavalry. Returning into Gaul, he put his legions
          into winter-quarters, and gave orders for building six hundred sail
          of both sorts. With these he again crossed over early in spring
          into Britain, but, whilst he was marching with the army against the
          enemy, the ships, riding at anchor, were caught in a storm and
          either dashed one against another, or driven upon the sands and
          wrecked. Forty of them were lost, the rest <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page010">[pg 010]</span><a name="Pg010" id="Pg010" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> were, with much difficulty, repaired.
          Caesar's cavalry was, at the first encounter, defeated by the
          Britons, and there Labienus, the tribune, was slain. In the second
          engagement, with great hazard to his men, he defeated the Britons
          and put them to flight. Thence he proceeded to the river Thames,
          where a great multitude of the enemy had posted themselves on the
          farther side of the river, under the command of
          Cassobellaunus,<a id="noteref_34" name="noteref_34" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_34"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">34</span></span></a> and
          fenced the bank of the river and almost all the ford under water
          with sharp stakes: the remains of these are to be seen to this day,
          apparently about the thickness of a man's thigh, cased with lead,
          and fixed immovably in the bottom of the river. This being
          perceived and avoided by the Romans, the barbarians, not able to
          stand the charge of the legions, hid themselves in the woods,
          whence they grievously harassed the Romans with repeated sallies.
          In the meantime, the strong state of the Trinovantes,<a id="noteref_35" name="noteref_35" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_35"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">35</span></span></a> with
          their commander Androgius,<a id="noteref_36" name="noteref_36" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_36"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">36</span></span></a>
          surrendered to Caesar, giving him forty hostages. Many other
          cities, following their example, made a treaty with the Romans.
          Guided by them, Caesar at length, after severe fighting, took the
          town of Cassobellaunus,<a id="noteref_37" name="noteref_37" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_37"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">37</span></span></a>
          situated between two marshes, fortified by sheltering woods, and
          plentifully furnished with all necessaries. After this, Caesar
          returned from Britain into Gaul, but he had no sooner put his
          legions into winter quarters, than he was suddenly beset and

          Claudius, fourth emperor from Augustus, being desirous to approve
          himself a prince beneficial to the republic, and eagerly bent upon
          war and conquest on every side, undertook an expedition into
          Britain, which as it appeared, was roused to rebellion by the
          refusal of the Romans to give up certain deserters. No one before
          or after Julius Caesar had dared to land upon the island. Claudius
          crossed over to it, and within a very few days, without any
          fighting or bloodshed, the greater part of the island was
          surrendered into his hands. He also added to the Roman empire the
          Orcades,<a id="noteref_39" name="noteref_39" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_39"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">39</span></span></a> which

          which is the forty-sixth from the Incarnation of our Lord. In which

          reign of Nero, and was more lasting and cruel than almost any
          before it; for it was carried on incessantly for the space of ten
          years, with burning of churches, proscription of innocent persons,
          and the slaughter of martyrs. Finally, Britain also attained to the
          great glory of bearing faithful witness to God.</p>

          rulers all manner of cruelty was practised against the Christians,

          from his persecutors. This man he observed to be engaged in
          continual prayer and watching day and night; when on a sudden the
          Divine grace shining on him, he began to imitate the example of
          faith and piety which was set before him, and being gradually
          instructed by his wholesome admonitions, he cast off the darkness
          of idolatry, and became a Christian in all sincerity of heart. The
          aforesaid clerk having been some days entertained by him, it came
          to the ears of the impious prince, that a confessor of Christ, to
          whom a martyr's place had not yet been assigned, was concealed at
          Alban's house. Whereupon he sent some soldiers to make a strict
          search after him. When they came to the martyr's hut, St. Alban
          presently came forth to the soldiers, instead of his guest and
          master, in the habit or long coat which he wore, and was bound and
          led before the judge.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It happened that
          the judge, at the time when Alban was carried before him, was
          standing at the altar, and offering sacrifice to devils. When he
          saw Alban, being much enraged that he should thus, of his own
          accord, dare to put himself into the hands of the soldiers, and
          incur such danger on behalf of the guest whom he had harboured, he
          commanded him to be dragged to the images of the devils, before
          which he stood, saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“Because you have
          chosen to conceal a rebellious and sacrilegious man, rather than to
          deliver him up to the soldiers, that his contempt of the gods might
          meet with the penalty due to such blasphemy, you shall undergo all
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page016">[pg 016]</span><a name="Pg016" id="Pg016" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the punishment that
          was due to him, if you seek to abandon the worship of our
          religion.”</span> But St. Alban, who had voluntarily declared
          himself a Christian to the persecutors of the faith, was not at all
          daunted by the prince's threats, but putting on the armour of
          spiritual warfare, publicly declared that he would not obey his
          command. Then said the judge, <span class="tei tei-q">“Of what
          family or race are you?”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“What does
          it concern you,”</span> answered Alban, <span class="tei tei-q">“of
          what stock I am? If you desire to hear the truth of my religion, be
          it known to you, that I am now a Christian, and free to fulfil
          Christian duties.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“I ask your
          name,”</span> said the judge; <span class="tei tei-q">“tell me it
          immediately.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“I am called Alban by
          my parents,”</span> replied he; <span class="tei tei-q">“and I
          worship ever and adore the true and living God, Who created all
          things.”</span> Then the judge, filled with anger, said,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“If you would enjoy the happiness of
          eternal life, do not delay to offer sacrifice to the great
          gods.”</span> Alban rejoined, <span class="tei tei-q">“These
          sacrifices, which by you are offered to devils, neither can avail
          the worshippers, nor fulfil the desires and petitions of the
          suppliants. Rather, whosoever shall offer sacrifice to these
          images, shall receive the everlasting pains of hell for his
          reward.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The judge,
          hearing these words, and being much incensed, ordered this holy
          confessor of God to be scourged by the executioners, believing that
          he might by stripes shake that constancy of heart, on which he
          could not prevail by words. He, being most cruelly tortured, bore
          the same patiently, or rather joyfully, for our Lord's sake. When
          the judge perceived that he was not to be overcome by tortures, or
          withdrawn from the exercise of the Christian religion, he ordered
          him to be put to death. Being led to execution, he came to a river,
          which, with a most rapid course, ran between the wall of the town
          and the arena where he was to be executed.<a id="noteref_53" name="noteref_53" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_53"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">53</span></span></a> He
          there saw a great multitude of persons of both sexes, and of divers
          ages and conditions, who were doubtless assembled by Divine
          inspiration, to attend the blessed confessor and martyr,
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page017">[pg 017]</span><a name="Pg017" id="Pg017" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and had so filled
          the bridge over the river, that he could scarce pass over that
          evening. In truth, almost all had gone out, so that the judge
          remained in the city without attendance. St. Alban, therefore,
          urged by an ardent and devout wish to attain the sooner to
          martyrdom, drew near to the stream, and lifted up his eyes to
          heaven, whereupon the channel was immediately dried up, and he
          perceived that the water had given place and made way for him to
          pass. Among the rest, the executioner, who should have put him to
          death, observed this, and moved doubtless by Divine inspiration
          hastened to meet him at the appointed place of execution, and
          casting away the sword which he had carried ready drawn, fell at
          his feet, praying earnestly that he might rather be accounted
          worthy to suffer with the martyr, whom he was ordered to execute,
          or, if possible, instead of him.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whilst he was
          thus changed from a persecutor into a companion in the faith and
          truth, and the other executioners rightly hesitated to take up the
          sword which was lying on the ground, the holy confessor,
          accompanied by the multitude, ascended a hill, about half a mile
          from the arena, beautiful, as was fitting, and of most pleasing
          appearance, adorned, or rather clothed, everywhere with flowers of
          many colours, nowhere steep or precipitous or of sheer descent, but
          with a long, smooth natural slope, like a plain, on its sides, a
          place altogether worthy from of old, by reason of its native
          beauty, to be consecrated by the blood of a blessed martyr. On the
          top of this hill, St. Alban prayed that God would give him water,
          and immediately a living spring, confined in its channel, sprang up
          at his feet, so that all men acknowledged that even the stream had
          yielded its service to the martyr. For it was impossible that the
          martyr, who had left no water remaining in the river, should desire
          it on the top of the hill, unless he thought it fitting. The river
          then having done service and fulfilled the pious duty, returned to
          its natural course, leaving a testimony of its obedience.<a id="noteref_54" name="noteref_54" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_54"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">54</span></span></a> Here,
          therefore, the head of the undaunted martyr was <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page018">[pg 018]</span><a name="Pg018" id="Pg018" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> struck off, and here he received the
          crown of life, which God has promised to them that love him. But he
          who laid impious hands on the holy man's neck was not permitted to
          rejoice over his dead body; for his eyes dropped upon the ground at
          the same moment as the blessed martyr's head fell.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the same time
          was also beheaded the soldier, who before, through the Divine
          admonition, refused to strike the holy confessor. Of whom it is
          apparent, that though he was not purified by the waters of baptism,
          yet he was cleansed by the washing of his own blood, and rendered
          worthy to enter the kingdom of heaven. Then the judge, astonished
          at the unwonted sight of so many heavenly miracles, ordered the
          persecution to cease immediately, and began to honour the death of
          the saints, by which he once thought that they might have been
          turned from their zeal for the Christian faith. The blessed Alban
          suffered death on the twenty-second day of June, near the city of
          Verulam,<a id="noteref_55" name="noteref_55" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_55"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">55</span></span></a> which

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the storm
          of persecution ceased, the faithful Christians, who, during the
          time of danger, had hidden themselves in woods and deserts and
          secret caves, came forth and rebuilt the churches which had been
          levelled to the ground; founded, erected, and finished the
          cathedrals raised in honour of the holy martyrs, and, as if
          displaying their conquering standards in all places, celebrated
          festivals and performed their sacred rites with pure hearts and
          lips. This peace continued in the Christian churches of Britain
          until the time of the Arian madness, which, having corrupted the
          whole world, infected this island also, so far removed from the
          rest of the world, with the poison of its error; and when once a
          way was opened across the sea for that plague, straightway all the
          taint of every heresy fell upon the island, ever desirous to hear
          some new thing, and never holding firm to any sure belief.</p>

          Constantius, who, whilst Diocletian was alive, governed Gaul and

          the British part of Britain, destitute of armed soldiers, of all

          had been led away by the rashness of the tyrants never to return,
          was wholly exposed to rapine, the people being altogether ignorant

          inlets of the sea lying between them, one of which runs into the
          interior of Britain, from the Eastern Sea, and the other from the

          subjection, provided that the impending enemy should be driven
          away. An armed legion was immediately sent them, which, arriving in
          the island, and engaging the enemy, slew a great multitude of them,
          drove the rest out of the territories of their allies, and having
          in the meanwhile delivered them from their worst distress, advised
          them to build a wall between the two seas across the island, that
          it might secure them by keeping off the enemy. So they returned
          home with great triumph. But the islanders building the wall which
          they had been told to raise, not of stone, since they had no
          workmen capable of such a work, but of sods, made it of no use.
          Nevertheless, they carried it for many miles between the two bays
          or inlets of the sea of which we have spoken;<a id="noteref_76" name="noteref_76" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_76"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">76</span></span></a> to the
          end that where the protection of the water was wanting, they might
          use the rampart to defend their borders from the irruptions of the
          enemies. Of the work there erected, that is, of a rampart of great
          breadth and height, there are evident remains to be seen at this
          day. It begins at about two miles' distance from the monastery of
          Aebbercurnig,<a id="noteref_77" name="noteref_77" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_77"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">77</span></span></a> west
          of it, at a place called in the Pictish language Peanfahel,<a id="noteref_78" name="noteref_78" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_78"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">78</span></span></a> but in
          the English tongue, Penneltun, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page025">[pg 025]</span><a name="Pg025" id="Pg025" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and running westward, ends near the city of
          Alcluith.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the former
          enemies, when they perceived that the Roman soldiers were gone,
          immediately coming by sea, broke into the borders, trampled and
          overran all places, and like men mowing ripe corn, bore down all
          before them. Hereupon messengers were again sent to Rome miserably
          imploring aid, lest their wretched country should be utterly
          blotted out, and the name of a Roman province, so long renowned
          among them, overthrown by the cruelties of foreign races, might
          become utterly contemptible. A legion was accordingly sent again,
          and, arriving unexpectedly in autumn, made great slaughter of the
          enemy, obliging all those that could escape, to flee beyond the
          sea; whereas before, they were wont yearly to carry off their booty
          without any opposition. Then the Romans declared to the Britons,
          that they could not for the future undertake such troublesome
          expeditions for their sake, and advised them rather to take up arms
          and make an effort to engage their enemies, who could not prove too
          powerful for them, unless they themselves were enervated by
          cowardice. Moreover, thinking that it might be some help to the
          allies, whom they were forced to abandon, they constructed a strong
          stone wall from sea to sea, in a straight line between the towns
          that had been there built for fear of the enemy, where Severus also
          had formerly built a rampart.<a id="noteref_79" name="noteref_79" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_79"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">79</span></span></a> This
          famous wall, which is still to be seen, was raised at public and
          private expense, the Britons also lending their assistance. It is
          eight feet in breadth, and twelve in height, in a straight line
          from east to west, as is still evident to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page026">[pg 026]</span><a name="Pg026" id="Pg026" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> beholders. This being presently finished,
          they gave the dispirited people good advice, and showed them how to
          furnish themselves with arms. Besides, they built towers to command
          a view of the sea, at intervals, on the southern coast, where their
          ships lay, because there also the invasions of the barbarians were
          apprehended, and so took leave of their allies, never to return
          again.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After their
          departure to their own country, the Scots and Picts, understanding
          that they had refused to return, at once came back, and growing
          more confident than they had been before, occupied all the northern
          and farthest part of the island, driving out the natives, as far as
          the wall. Hereupon a timorous guard was placed upon the
          fortification, where, dazed with fear, they became ever more
          dispirited day by day. On the other side, the enemy constantly
          attacked them with barbed weapons, by which the cowardly defenders
          were dragged in piteous fashion from the wall, and dashed against
          the ground. At last, the Britons, forsaking their cities and wall,
          took to flight and were scattered. The enemy pursued, and forthwith
          followed a massacre more grievous than ever before; for the
          wretched natives were torn in pieces by their enemies, as lambs are
          torn by wild beasts. Thus, being expelled from their dwellings and
          lands, they saved themselves from the immediate danger of
          starvation by robbing and plundering one another, adding to the
          calamities inflicted by the enemy their own domestic broils, till
          the whole country was left destitute of food except such as could
          be procured in the chase.</p>

          Attila himself remained so intolerable an enemy to the Republic,
          that he ravaged almost all Europe, attacking and destroying cities
          and castles. At the same time there was a famine at Constantinople,
          and soon after a plague followed; moreover, a great part of the
          wall of that city, with fifty-seven towers, fell to the ground.
          Many cities also went to ruin, and the famine and pestilential
          state of the air destroyed thousands of men and cattle.</p>

          morals, pestilence, and the downfall of the nation.</span></h2>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the meantime,
          the aforesaid famine distressing the Britons more and more, and
          leaving to posterity a lasting memory of its mischievous effects,
          obliged many of them to submit themselves to the depredators;
          though others still held out, putting their trust in God, when
          human help failed. These continually made raids from the mountains,
          caves, and woods, and, at length, began to inflict severe losses on
          their enemies, who had been for so many years plundering the
          country. The bold Irish robbers thereupon returned home, intending
          to come again before long. The Picts then settled down in the
          farthest part of the island and afterwards remained there, but they
          did not fail to plunder and harass the Britons from time to
          time.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now, when the
          ravages of the enemy at length abated, the island began to abound
          with such plenty of grain as had never been known in any age
          before; along with plenty, evil living increased, and this was
          immediately attended by the taint of all manner of crime; in
          particular, cruelty, hatred of truth, and love of falsehood;
          insomuch, that if any one among them happened to be milder than the
          rest, and more inclined to truth, all the rest abhorred and
          persecuted him unrestrainedly, as if he had been the enemy of
          Britain. Nor were the laity only guilty of these things, but even
          our Lord's own flock, with its shepherds, casting off the easy yoke
          of Christ, gave themselves up to drunkenness, enmity, quarrels,
          strife, envy, and other such sins. In the meantime, on a sudden, a
          grievous plague fell upon that corrupt generation, which soon
          destroyed such numbers of them, that the living scarcely availed to
          bury the dead: yet, those that survived, could not be recalled from
          the spiritual death, which they had incurred through their
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page029">[pg 029]</span><a name="Pg029" id="Pg029" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> sins, either by the
          death of their friends, or the fear of death. Whereupon, not long
          after, a more severe vengeance for their fearful crimes fell upon
          the sinful nation. They held a council to determine what was to be
          done, and where they should seek help to prevent or repel the cruel
          and frequent incursions of the northern nations; and in concert
          with their King Vortigern,<a id="noteref_83" name="noteref_83" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_83"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">83</span></span></a> it was

          arrived in Britain with three ships of war and had a place in which
          to settle assigned to them by the same king, in the eastern part of
          the island, on the pretext of fighting in defence of their country,
          whilst their real intentions were to conquer it. Accordingly they
          engaged with the enemy, who were come from the north to give
          battle, and the Saxons obtained the victory. When the news of their
          success and of the fertility of the country, and the cowardice of
          the Britons, reached their own home, a <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page030">[pg 030]</span><a name="Pg030" id="Pg030" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> more considerable fleet was quickly sent
          over, bringing a greater number of men, and these, being added to
          the former army, made up an invincible force. The newcomers
          received of the Britons a place to inhabit among them, upon
          condition that they should wage war against their enemies for the
          peace and security of the country, whilst the Britons agreed to
          furnish them with pay. Those who came over were of the three most
          powerful nations of Germany—Saxons, Angles, and Jutes. From the
          Jutes are descended the people of Kent, and of the Isle of Wight,
          including those in the province of the West-Saxons who are to this
          day called Jutes, seated opposite to the Isle of Wight. From the
          Saxons, that is, the country which is now called Old Saxony, came
          the East-Saxons, the South-Saxons, and the West-Saxons. From the
          Angles, that is, the country which is called Angulus,<a id="noteref_87" name="noteref_87" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_87"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">87</span></span></a> and
          which is said, from that time, to have remained desert to this day,
          between the provinces of the Jutes and the Saxons, are descended
          the East-Angles, the Midland-Angles, the Mercians, all the race of
          the Northumbrians, that is, of those nations that dwell on the
          north side of the river Humber, and the other nations of the
          Angles. The first commanders are said to have been the two brothers
          Hengist and Horsa. Of these Horsa was afterwards slain in battle by
          the Britons,<a id="noteref_88" name="noteref_88" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_88"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">88</span></span></a> and a
          monument, bearing his name, is still in existence in the eastern
          parts of Kent. They were the sons of Victgilsus, whose father was
          Vitta, son of Vecta, son of Woden; from whose stock the royal race
          of many provinces trace their descent. In a short time, swarms of
          the aforesaid nations came over into the island, and the foreigners
          began to increase so much, that they became a source of terror to
          the natives themselves <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page031">[pg
          031]</span><a name="Pg031" id="Pg031" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          who had invited them. Then, having on a sudden entered into league
          with the Picts, whom they had by this time repelled by force of
          arms, they began to turn their weapons against their allies. At
          first, they obliged them to furnish a greater quantity of
          provisions; and, seeking an occasion of quarrel, protested, that
          unless more plentiful supplies were brought them, they would break
          the league, and ravage all the island; nor were they backward in
          putting their threats into execution. In short, the fire kindled by
          the hands of the pagans, proved God's just vengeance for the crimes
          of the people; not unlike that which, being of old lighted by the
          Chaldeans, consumed the walls and all the buildings of Jerusalem.
          For here, too, through the agency of the pitiless conqueror, yet by
          the disposal of the just Judge, it ravaged all the neighbouring
          cities and country, spread the conflagration from the eastern to
          the western sea, without any opposition, and overran the whole face
          of the doomed island. Public as well as private buildings were
          overturned; the priests were everywhere slain before the altars; no
          respect was shown for office, the prelates with the people were
          destroyed with fire and sword; nor were there any left to bury
          those who had been thus cruelly slaughtered. Some of the miserable
          remnant, being taken in the mountains, were butchered in heaps.
          Others, spent with hunger, came forth and submitted themselves to
          the enemy, to undergo for the sake of food perpetual servitude, if
          they were not killed upon the spot. Some, with sorrowful hearts,
          fled beyond the seas. Others, remaining in their own country, led a
          miserable life of terror and anxiety of mind among the mountains,
          woods and crags.</p>

          their leader, Ambrosius Aurelianus,<a id="noteref_90" name="noteref_90" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_90"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">90</span></span></a> a man
          of worth, who alone, by chance, of the Roman nation had survived
          the storm, in which his parents, who were of the royal race, had
          perished. Under him the Britons revived, and offering battle to the
          victors, by the help of God, gained the victory. From that day,
          sometimes the natives, and sometimes their enemies, prevailed, till
          the year of the siege of Badon-hill,<a id="noteref_91" name="noteref_91" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_91"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">91</span></span></a> when

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Some few years
          before their arrival, the Pelagian heresy, brought over by
          Agricola, the son of Severianus,<a id="noteref_92" name="noteref_92" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_92"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">92</span></span></a> a
          Pelagian bishop, had corrupted with its foul taint the faith of the
          Britons. But whereas they absolutely refused to embrace that
          perverse doctrine, and blaspheme the grace of Christ, yet were not
          able of themselves to confute the subtilty of the unholy belief by
          force of argument, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page033">[pg
          033]</span><a name="Pg033" id="Pg033" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          they bethought them of wholesome counsels and determined to crave
          aid of the Gallican prelates in that spiritual warfare. Hereupon,
          these, having assembled a great synod, consulted together to
          determine what persons should be sent thither to sustain the faith,
          and by unanimous consent, choice was made of the apostolic
          prelates, Germanus, Bishop of Auxerre, and Lupus of Troyes,<a id="noteref_93" name="noteref_93" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_93"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">93</span></span></a> to go
          into Britain to confirm the people's faith in the grace of God.
          With ready zeal they complied with the request and commands of the
          Holy Church, and put to sea. The ship sped safely with favouring
          winds till they were halfway between the coast of Gaul and Britain.
          There on a sudden they were obstructed by the malevolence of
          demons, who were jealous that men of such eminence and piety should
          be sent to bring back the people to salvation. They raised storms,
          and darkened the sky with clouds. The sails could not support the
          fury of the winds, the sailors' skill was forced to give way, the
          ship was sustained by prayer, not by strength, and as it happened,
          their spiritual leader and bishop, being spent with weariness, had
          fallen asleep. Then, as if because resistance flagged, the tempest
          gathered strength, and the ship, overwhelmed by the waves, was
          ready to sink. Then the blessed Lupus and all the rest, greatly
          troubled, awakened their elder, that he might oppose the raging
          elements. He, showing himself the more resolute in proportion to
          the greatness of the danger, called upon Christ, and having, in the
          name of the Holy Trinity, taken and sprinkled a little water,
          quelled the raging waves, admonished his companion, encouraged all,
          and all with one consent uplifted their <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page034">[pg 034]</span><a name="Pg034" id="Pg034" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> voices in prayer. Divine help was granted,
          the enemies were put to flight, a cloudless calm ensued, the winds
          veering about set themselves again to forward their voyage, the sea
          was soon traversed, and they reached the quiet of the wished-for
          shore. A multitude flocking thither from all parts, received the
          bishops, whose coming had been foretold by the predictions even of
          their adversaries. For the evil spirits declared their fear, and
          when the bishops expelled them from the bodies of the possessed,
          they made known the nature of the tempest, and the dangers they had
          occasioned, and confessed that they had been overcome by the merits
          and authority of these men.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the meantime
          the bishops speedily filled the island of Britain with the fame of
          their preaching and miracles; and the Word of God was by them daily
          preached, not only in the churches, but even in the streets and
          fields, so that the faithful and Catholic were everywhere
          confirmed, and those who had been perverted accepted the way of
          amendment. Like the Apostles, they acquired honour and authority
          through a good conscience, learning through the study of letters,
          and the power of working miracles through their merits. Thus the
          whole country readily came over to their way of thinking; the
          authors of the erroneous belief kept themselves in hiding, and,
          like evil spirits, grieved for the loss of the people that were
          rescued from them. At length, after long deliberation, they had the
          boldness to enter the lists.<a id="noteref_94" name="noteref_94" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_94"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">94</span></span></a> They
          came forward in all the splendour of their wealth, with gorgeous
          apparel, and supported by a numerous following; choosing rather to
          hazard the contest, than to undergo among the people whom they had
          led astray, the reproach of having been silenced, lest they should
          seem by saying nothing to condemn themselves. An immense multitude
          had been attracted thither with their wives and children. The
          people were present as spectators and judges; the two parties stood
          there in very different case; on the one side was Divine faith, on
          the other <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page035">[pg
          035]</span><a name="Pg035" id="Pg035" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          human presumption; on the one side piety, on the other pride; on
          the one side Pelagius, the founder of their faith, on the other
          Christ. The blessed bishops permitted their adversaries to speak
          first, and their empty speech long took up the time and filled the
          ears with meaningless words. Then the venerable prelates poured
          forth the torrent of their eloquence and showered upon them the
          words of Apostles and Evangelists, mingling the Scriptures with
          their own discourse and supporting their strongest assertions by
          the testimony of the written Word. Vainglory was vanquished and
          unbelief refuted; and the heretics, at every argument put before
          them, not being able to reply, confessed their errors. The people,
          giving judgement, could scarce refrain from violence, and signified
          their verdict by their acclamations.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After this, a
          certain man, who held the office of tribune, came forward with his
          wife, and brought his blind daughter, a child of ten years of age,
          to be healed of the bishops. They ordered her to be brought to
          their adversaries, who, being rebuked by their own conscience,
          joined their entreaties to those of the child's parents, and
          besought the bishops that she might be healed. They, therefore,
          perceiving their adversaries to yield, poured forth a short prayer,
          and then Germanus, full of the Holy Ghost, invoking the Trinity, at
          once drew from his side a casket which hung about his neck,
          containing relics of the saints, and, taking it in his hands,
          applied it in the sight of all to the girl's eyes, which were
          immediately delivered from darkness and filled with the light of
          truth. The parents rejoiced, and the people were filled with awe at
          the miracle; and after that day, the heretical beliefs were so
          fully obliterated from the minds <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page036">[pg 036]</span><a name="Pg036" id="Pg036" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of all, that they thirsted for and sought
          after the doctrine of the bishops.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This damnable
          heresy being thus suppressed, and the authors thereof confuted, and
          all the people settled in the purity of the faith, the bishops went
          to the tomb of the martyr, the blessed Alban, to give thanks to God
          through him. There Germanus, having with him relics of all the
          Apostles, and of divers martyrs, after offering up his prayers,
          commanded the tomb to be opened, that he might lay therein the
          precious gifts; judging it fitting, that the limbs of saints
          brought together from divers countries, as their equal merits had
          procured them admission into heaven, should find shelter in one
          tomb. These being honourably bestowed, and laid together, he took
          up a handful of dust from the place where the blessed martyr's
          blood had been shed, to carry away with him. In this dust the blood
          had been preserved, showing that the slaughter of the martyrs was
          red, though the persecutor was pale in death.<a id="noteref_95" name="noteref_95" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_95"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">95</span></span></a> In

          being detained there by sickness, by his prayers quenched a fire
          that had broken out among the houses, and was himself cured of his
          infirmity by a vision. [429</span> <span class="tei tei-hi" style="text-align: left"><span style="font-size: 144%; font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span><span style="font-size: 144%">]</span></h2>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As they were
          returning thence, the treacherous enemy, having, as it chanced,
          prepared a snare, caused Germanus to bruise his foot by a fall, not
          knowing that, as it was with the blessed Job, his merits would be
          but increased by bodily affliction. Whilst he was thus detained
          some time in the same place by his infirmity, a fire broke out in a
          cottage neighbouring to that in which he was; and having burned
          down the other houses which were thatched <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page037">[pg 037]</span><a name="Pg037" id="Pg037" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> with reed, fanned by the wind, was carried on
          to the dwelling in which he lay. The people all flocked to the
          prelate, entreating that they might lift him in their arms, and
          save him from the impending danger. But he rebuked them, and in the
          assurance of his faith, would not suffer himself to be removed. The
          whole multitude, in terror and despair, ran to oppose the
          conflagration; but, for the greater manifestation of the Divine
          power, whatsoever the crowd endeavoured to save, was destroyed; and
          what the sick and helpless man defended, the flame avoided and
          passed by, though the house that sheltered the holy man lay open to
          it,<a id="noteref_96" name="noteref_96" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_96"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">96</span></span></a> and
          while the fire raged on every side, the place in which he lay
          appeared untouched, amid the general conflagration. The multitude
          rejoiced at the miracle, and was gladly vanquished by the power of
          God. A great crowd of people watched day and night before the
          humble cottage; some to have their souls healed, and some their
          bodies. All that Christ wrought in the person of his servant, all
          the wonders the sick man performed cannot be told. Moreover, he
          would suffer no medicines to be applied to his infirmity; but one
          night he saw one clad in garments as white as snow, standing by
          him, who reaching out his hand, seemed to raise him up, and ordered
          him to stand firm upon his feet; from which time his pain ceased,
          and he was so perfectly restored, that when the day came, with good
          courage he set forth upon his journey.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the meantime,
          the Saxons and Picts, with their united forces, made war upon the
          Britons, who in these straits were compelled to take up arms. In
          their terror thinking themselves unequal to their enemies, they
          implored the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page038">[pg
          038]</span><a name="Pg038" id="Pg038" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          assistance of the holy bishops; who, hastening to them as they had
          promised, inspired so much confidence into these fearful people,
          that one would have thought they had been joined by a mighty army.
          Thus, by these apostolic leaders, Christ Himself commanded in their
          camp. The holy days of Lent were also at hand, and were rendered
          more sacred by the presence of the bishops, insomuch that the
          people being instructed by daily sermons, came together eagerly to
          receive the grace of baptism. For a great multitude of the army
          desired admission to the saving waters, and a wattled church was
          constructed for the Feast of the Resurrection of our Lord, and so
          fitted up for the army in the field as if it were in a city. Still
          wet with the baptismal water the troops set forth; the faith of the
          people was fired; and where arms had been deemed of no avail, they
          looked to the help of God. News reached the enemy of the manner and
          method of their purification,<a id="noteref_97" name="noteref_97" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_97"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">97</span></span></a> who,
          assured of success, as if they had to deal with an unarmed host,
          hastened forward with renewed eagerness. But their approach was
          made known by scouts. When, after the celebration of Easter, the
          greater part of the army, fresh from the font, began to take up
          arms and prepare for war, Germanus offered to be their leader. He
          picked out the most active, explored the country round about, and
          observed, in the way by which the enemy was expected, a valley
          encompassed by hills<a id="noteref_98" name="noteref_98" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_98"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">98</span></span></a> of
          moderate height. In that place he drew up his untried troops,
          himself acting as their general. And now a formidable host of foes
          drew near, visible, as they approached, to his men lying in ambush.
          Then, on a sudden, Germanus, bearing the standard, exhorted his
          men, and bade them all in a loud voice repeat <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page039">[pg 039]</span><a name="Pg039" id="Pg039" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> his words. As the enemy advanced in all
          security, thinking to take them by surprise, the bishops three
          times cried, <span class="tei tei-q">“Hallelujah.”</span> A
          universal shout of the same word followed, and the echoes from the
          surrounding hills gave back the cry on all sides, the enemy was
          panic-stricken, fearing, not only the neighbouring rocks, but even
          the very frame of heaven above them; and such was their terror,
          that their feet were not swift enough to save them. They fled in
          disorder, casting away their arms, and well satisfied if, even with
          unprotected bodies, they could escape the danger; many of them,
          flying headlong in their fear, were engulfed by the river which
          they had crossed. The Britons, without a blow, inactive spectators
          of the victory they had gained, beheld their vengeance complete.
          The scattered spoils were gathered up, and the devout soldiers
          rejoiced in the success which Heaven had granted them. The prelates
          thus triumphed over the enemy without bloodshed, and gained a
          victory by faith, without the aid of human force. Thus, having
          settled the affairs of the island, and restored tranquillity by the
          defeat of the invisible foes, as well as of enemies in the flesh,
          they prepared to return home. Their own merits, and the
          intercession of the blessed martyr Alban, obtained for them a calm
          passage, and the happy vessel restored them in peace to the desires
          of their people.</p>

          He speedily complied with their request; and taking <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page040">[pg 040]</span><a name="Pg040" id="Pg040" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> with him Severus,<a id="noteref_99" name="noteref_99" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_99"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">99</span></span></a> a man
          of singular sanctity, who was disciple to the blessed father,
          Lupus, bishop of Troyes, and at that time, having been ordained
          bishop of the Treveri, was preaching the Word of God to the tribes
          of Upper Germany, put to sea, and with favouring winds and calm
          waters sailed to Britain.<a id="noteref_100" name="noteref_100" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_100"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">100</span></span></a></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the meantime,
          the evil spirits, speeding through the whole island, were
          constrained against their will to foretell that Germanus was
          coming, insomuch, that one Elafius, a chief of that region, without
          tidings from any visible messenger, hastened to meet the holy men,
          carrying with him his son, who in the very flower of his youth
          laboured under a grievous infirmity; for the sinews of the knee
          were wasted and shrunk, so that the withered limb was denied the
          power to walk. All the country followed this Elafius. The bishops
          arrived, and were met by the ignorant multitude, whom they blessed,
          and preached the Word of God to them. They found the people
          constant in the faith as they had left them; and learning that but
          few had gone astray, they sought out the authors of the evil and
          condemned them. Then suddenly Elafius cast himself at the feet of
          the bishops, presenting his son, whose distress was visible and
          needed no words to express it. All were grieved, but especially the
          bishops, who, filled with pity, invoked the mercy of God; and
          straightway the blessed Germanus, causing the youth to sit down,
          touched the bent and feeble knee and passed his healing hand over
          all the diseased part. At once health was restored by the power of
          his touch, the withered limb regained its vigour, the sinews
          resumed their task, and the youth was, in the presence of all the
          people, delivered whole to his father. The multitude was amazed at
          the miracle, and the Catholic faith was firmly established in the
          hearts of all; after which, they were, in a sermon, exhorted to
          amend their error. By the judgement of all, the exponents of the
          heresy, who had been <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page041">[pg
          041]</span><a name="Pg041" id="Pg041" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          banished from the island, were brought before the bishops, to be
          conveyed into the continent, that the country might be rid of them,
          and they corrected of their errors. So it came to pass that the
          faith in those parts continued long after pure and untainted. Thus
          when they had settled all things, the blessed prelates returned
          home as prosperously as they had come.</p>

          it everlasting joys in heaven, and a kingdom that would never end,
          with the living and true God. The king hearing this, gave orders
          that they should stay in the island where they had landed, and be
          furnished with necessaries, till he should consider what to do with
          them. For he had before heard of the Christian religion, having a

          was sent with her to support her in the faith. Some days after, the
          king came into the island, and sitting in the open air, ordered
          Augustine and his companions to come and hold a conference with
          him. For he had taken precaution that they should not come to him
          in any house, lest, by so coming, according to an ancient
          superstition, if they practised any magical arts, they might impose
          upon him, and so get the better of him. But they came endued with
          Divine, not with magic power, bearing a silver cross for their
          banner, and the image of our Lord and Saviour painted on a board;
          and chanting litanies, they offered up their prayers to the Lord
          for the eternal salvation both of themselves and of those to whom
          and for whom they had come. When they had sat down, in obedience to

          as to forsake that which I have so long observed with the whole
          English nation. But because you are come from far as strangers into
          my kingdom, and, as I conceive, are desirous to impart to us those
          things which you believe to be true, and most beneficial, we desire
          not to harm you, but will give you favourable entertainment, and
          take care to supply you with all things necessary to your
          sustenance; nor do we forbid you to preach and gain as many as you
          can to your religion.”</span> Accordingly he gave them an abode in
          the city of Canterbury,<a id="noteref_116" name="noteref_116" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_116"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">116</span></span></a> which
          was the metropolis of all his dominions, and, as he had promised,
          besides supplying them with sustenance, did not refuse them liberty
          to preach. It is told that, as they drew near to the city, after
          their manner, with the holy cross, and the image of our sovereign
          Lord and King, Jesus Christ, they sang in concert this litany:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“We beseech thee, O Lord, for Thy great
          mercy, that Thy wrath and anger be turned away from this city, and
          from Thy holy house, for we have sinned. Hallelujah.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As soon as they
          entered the dwelling-place assigned to them, they began to imitate
          the Apostolic manner of life in the primitive Church; applying
          themselves to constant prayer, watchings, and fastings; preaching
          the Word of life to as many as they could; despising all worldly
          things, as in nowise concerning them; receiving only their
          necessary food from those they taught; living themselves in all
          respects conformably to what they taught, and being always ready to
          suffer any adversity, and even <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page048">[pg 048]</span><a name="Pg048" id="Pg048" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> to die for that truth which they preached. In
          brief, some believed and were baptized, admiring the simplicity of
          their blameless life, and the sweetness of their heavenly doctrine.
          There was on the east side of the city, a church dedicated of old
          to the honour of St. Martin,<a id="noteref_117" name="noteref_117" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_117"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">117</span></span></a> built
          whilst the Romans were still in the island, wherein the queen, who,
          as has been said before, was a Christian, was wont to pray. In this
          they also first began to come together, to chant the Psalms, to
          pray, to celebrate Mass, to preach, and to baptize, till when the
          king had been converted to the faith, they obtained greater liberty
          to preach everywhere and build or repair churches.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When he, among
          the rest, believed and was baptized, attracted by the pure life of
          these holy men and their gracious promises, the truth of which they
          established by many miracles, greater numbers began daily to flock
          together to hear the Word, and, forsaking their heathen rites, to
          have fellowship, through faith, in the unity of Christ's Holy
          Church. It is told that the king, while he rejoiced at their
          conversion and their faith, yet compelled none to embrace
          Christianity, but only showed more affection to the believers, as
          to his fellow citizens in the kingdom of Heaven. For he had learned
          from those who had instructed him and guided him to salvation, that
          the service of Christ ought to be voluntary, not by compulsion. Nor
          was it long before he gave his teachers a settled residence suited
          to their degree in his metropolis of Canterbury, with such
          possessions of divers sorts as were necessary for them.</p>

          manner of conversation towards their clergy? or into how many
          portions the offerings of the faithful at the altar are to be
          divided? and how the bishop is to act in the Church?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Gregory, Pope of the

          versed, testifies to this, and in particular the Epistles of the
          Blessed Paul to Timothy, wherein he endeavours to show him what
          should be his manner of conversation in the house of God; but it is
          the custom of the Apostolic see to prescribe these rules to bishops
          when they are ordained: that all emoluments which accrue, are to be
          divided into four portions;—one for the bishop and his household,
          for hospitality and entertainment of guests; another for the
          clergy; a third for the poor; and the fourth for the repair of
          churches. But in that you, my brother, having been instructed in
          monastic rules, must not live apart from your clergy in the Church
          of the English, which has been lately, by the will of God,
          converted to the faith, you must establish the manner of
          conversation of our fathers in the primitive Church, among whom,
          none said that aught of the things which they possessed was his
          own, but they had all things common.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But if there are
          any clerks not received into holy orders,<a id="noteref_122" name="noteref_122" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_122"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">122</span></span></a> who
          cannot live continent, they are to take wives, and receive their
          stipends outside of the community; because we know that it is
          written concerning the same fathers of whom we have spoken that a
          distribution was made unto every man according as he had need. Care
          is also to be taken of their stipends, and provision to be made,
          and they are to be kept under ecclesiastical rule, that they may
          live orderly, and attend to singing of psalms, and, by the help of
          God, preserve their hearts and tongues and bodies from all that is
          unlawful. But as for those that live in common, there is no need to
          say anything of assigning portions, or dispensing hospitality and
          showing mercy; inasmuch as all that they have over is to be spent
          in pious and religious works, according to the teaching of Him who

          the Gallican, or any other Church, which may be more acceptable to
          Almighty God, you should carefully make choice of the same, and
          sedulously teach the Church of the English, which as yet is new in
          the faith, whatsoever you can gather from the several Churches. For
          things are not to be loved for the sake of places, but places for
          the sake of good things. Choose, therefore, from every Church those
          things that are pious, religious, and right, and when you have, as
          it were, made them up into one bundle, let the minds of the English
          be accustomed thereto.</p>

          answers.</span></span>—You may judge, my brother, by the condition
          of the thief, in what manner he is to be corrected. For there are
          some, who, having substance, commit theft; and there are others,
          who transgress in this matter through want. Wherefore it is
          requisite, that some be punished with fines, others with stripes;
          some with more severity, and some more mildly. And when the
          severity is greater, it is to proceed from charity, not from anger;
          because this is done for the sake of him who is corrected, that he
          may not be delivered up to the fires of Hell. For it behoves us to
          maintain discipline among the faithful, as good parents do with
          their children according to the flesh, whom they punish with
          stripes for their faults, and yet they design to make those whom
          they chastise their heirs, and preserve their possessions
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page052">[pg 052]</span><a name="Pg052" id="Pg052" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> for those whom they
          seem to visit in wrath. This charity is, therefore, to be kept in
          mind, and it dictates the measure of the punishment, so that the
          mind may do nothing beyond the rule prescribed by reason. You will
          add to this, how men are to restore those things which they have
          stolen from the church. But let not the Church take more than it
          has lost of its worldly possessions, or seek gain from
          vanities.</p>

          sister,<a id="noteref_125" name="noteref_125" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_125"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">125</span></span></a> or of
          two full brothers, or two sisters, may be joined in matrimony; but
          we have found, by experience, that the offspring of such wedlock
          cannot grow up; and the Divine law forbids a man to <span class="tei tei-q">“uncover the nakedness of his kindred.”</span> Hence of
          necessity it must be the third or fourth generation of the
          faithful, that can be lawfully joined in matrimony; for the second,
          which we have mentioned, must altogether abstain from one another.
          To marry with one's stepmother is a heinous crime, because it is
          written in the Law, <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou shalt not uncover
          the nakedness of thy father:”</span> now the son, indeed, cannot
          uncover his father's nakedness; but in regard that it is written,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“They twain shall be one flesh,”</span> he
          that presumes to uncover the nakedness of his stepmother, who was
          one flesh with his father, certainly uncovers the nakedness of his
          father. It is also prohibited to marry with a sister-in-law,
          because by the former union she is become the brother's flesh. For
          which thing <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page053">[pg
          053]</span><a name="Pg053" id="Pg053" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          also John the Baptist was beheaded, and obtained the crown of holy
          martyrdom. For, though he was not ordered to deny Christ, and it
          was not for confessing Christ that he was killed, yet inasmuch as
          the same Jesus Christ, our Lord, said, <span class="tei tei-q">“I
          am the Truth,”</span> because John was killed for the truth, he
          also shed his blood for Christ.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But forasmuch as
          there are many of the English, who, whilst they were still
          heathens, are said to have been joined in this unholy union, when
          they attain to the faith they are to be admonished to abstain, and
          be made to know that this is a grievous sin. Let them fear the
          dread judgement of God, lest, for the gratification of their carnal
          desires, they incur the torments of eternal punishment. Yet they
          are not on this account to be deprived of the Communion of the Body
          and Blood of Christ, lest they should seem to be punished for those
          things which they did through ignorance before they had received
          Baptism. For in these times the Holy Church chastises some things
          with zeal, and tolerates some in mercy, and is blind to some in her
          wisdom, and so, by forbearance and blindness often suppresses the
          evil that stands in her way. But all that come to the faith are to
          be admonished not to presume to do such things. And if any shall be
          guilty of them, they are to be excluded from the Communion of the
          Body and Blood of Christ. For as the offence is, in some measure,
          to be tolerated in those who did it through ignorance, so it is to
          be rigorously punished in those who do not fear to sin
          knowingly.</p>

          bishop? But we would have you, my brother, to ordain bishops in
          such a manner, that the said bishops may not be far <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page054">[pg 054]</span><a name="Pg054" id="Pg054" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> asunder, to the end that there be no

          when, by the help of God, bishops shall have been ordained in
          places near to one another, no ordination of a bishop is to take
          place without assembling three or four bishops. For, even in
          spiritual affairs, we may take example by the temporal, that they
          may be wisely and discreetly conducted. For surely, when marriages
          are celebrated in the world, some married persons are assembled,
          that those who went before in the way of matrimony, may also
          partake in the joy of the new union. Why, then, at this spiritual

          to God, should not such persons be assembled, as may either rejoice
          in the advancement of the new bishop, or jointly pour forth their
          prayers to Almighty God for his preservation?</p>

          concert with the said bishop of Arles, how, if there be any faults
          among the bishops, they may be amended. And if he shall be lukewarm

          the Church, as it were, by eating. But whatsoever is to be done by
          authority, must be transacted with the aforesaid bishop of Arles,
          lest that should be omitted, which the ancient institution of the

          answers.</span></span>—I do not doubt but that these questions have
          been put to you, my brother, and I think I have already answered
          you therein. But I believe you would wish the opinion which you
          yourself might give and hold to be confirmed by my reply also. Why
          should not a woman with child be baptized, since the fruitfulness
          of the flesh is no offence in the eyes of Almighty God? For when
          our first parents sinned in Paradise, they forfeited the
          immortality which they had received, by the just judgement of God.
          Because, therefore, Almighty God would not for their fault wholly
          destroy the human race, he both deprived man of immortality for his
          sin, and, at the same time, of his great goodness and
          loving-kindness, reserved to him the power of propagating his race
          after him. On what ground, then, can that which is preserved to
          human nature by the free gift of Almighty God, be excluded from the
          privilege of Holy Baptism? For it is very foolish to imagine that
          the gift can be opposed to grace in that Mystery in which all sin
          is blotted out. When a woman is delivered, after how many days she
          may come into the church, you have learnt from the teaching of the
          Old Testament, to wit, that she is to abstain for a male child
          thirty-three days, and sixty-six for a female. Now you must know
          that this is to be received in a mystery; for if she enters the
          church the very hour that she is delivered, to return thanks, she
          is not guilty of any sin; because the pleasure of the flesh is a
          fault, and not the pain; but the pleasure is in the copulation of
          the flesh, whereas there is pain in bringing forth the child.
          Wherefore it is said to the first mother of all, <span class="tei tei-q">“In sorrow thou shalt bring forth children.”</span> If,
          therefore, we forbid a woman that has brought forth, to enter the
          church, we make a crime of her very punishment. To baptize either a
          woman who has brought forth, if there be danger of death, even the
          very hour that she brings forth, or that which she has brought
          forth the very hour it is born, is in no way prohibited, because,
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page057">[pg 057]</span><a name="Pg057" id="Pg057" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> as the grace of the
          Holy Mystery is to be with much discretion provided for those who
          are in full life and capable of understanding, so is it to be
          without any delay administered to the dying; lest, while a further
          time is sought to confer the Mystery of redemption, if a small
          delay intervene, the person that is to be redeemed be dead and
          gone.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Her husband is
          not to approach her, till the infant born be weaned. An evil custom
          is sprung up in the lives of married people, in that women disdain
          to suckle the children whom they bring forth, and give them to
          other women to suckle; which seems to have been invented on no
          other account but incontinency; because, as they will not be
          continent, they will not suckle the children whom they bear. Those
          women, therefore, who, from evil custom, give their children to
          others to bring up, must not approach their husbands till the time
          of purification is past. For even when there has been no
          child-birth, women are forbidden to do so, whilst they have their
          courses, insomuch that the Law condemns to death any man that shall
          approach unto a woman during her uncleanness. Yet the woman,
          nevertheless, must not be forbidden to come into the church whilst
          she has her courses; because the superfluity of nature cannot be
          imputed to her as a crime; and it is not just that she should be
          refused admittance into the church, for that which she suffers
          against her will. For we know, that the woman who had the issue of
          blood, humbly approaching behind our Lord's back, touched the hem
          of his garment, and her infirmity immediately departed from her.
          If, therefore, she that had an issue of blood might commendably
          touch the garment of our Lord, why may not she, who has her
          courses, lawfully enter into the church of God? But you may say,
          Her infirmity compelled her, whereas these we speak of are bound by
          custom. Consider, then, most dear brother, that all we suffer in
          this mortal flesh, through the infirmity of our nature, is ordained
          by the just judgement of God after the fall; for to hunger, to
          thirst, to be hot, to be cold, to be weary, is from the
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page058">[pg 058]</span><a name="Pg058" id="Pg058" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> infirmity of our
          nature; and what else is it to seek food against hunger, drink
          against thirst, air against heat, clothes against cold, rest
          against weariness, than to procure a remedy against distempers?
          Thus to a woman her courses are a distemper. If, therefore, it was
          a commendable boldness in her, who in her disease touched our
          Lord's garment, why may not that which is allowed to one infirm
          person, be granted to all women, who, through the fault of their
          nature, are rendered infirm?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She must not,
          therefore, be forbidden to receive the Mystery of the Holy
          Communion during those days. But if any one out of profound respect
          does not presume to do it, she is to be commended; yet if she
          receives it, she is not to be judged. For it is the part of noble
          minds in some manner to acknowledge their faults, even when there
          is no fault; because very often that is done without a fault,
          which, nevertheless, proceeded from a fault. Thus, when we are
          hungry, it is no sin to eat; yet our being hungry proceeds from the
          sin of the first man. The courses are no sin in women, because they
          happen naturally; yet, because our nature itself is so depraved,
          that it appears to be defiled even without the concurrence of the
          will, a defect arises from sin, and thereby human nature may itself
          know what it is become by judgement. And let man, who wilfully
          committed the offence, bear the guilt of that offence against his
          will. And, therefore, let women consider with themselves, and if
          they do not presume, during their courses, to approach the
          Sacrament of the Body and Blood of our Lord, they are to be
          commended for their praiseworthy consideration; but when they are
          carried away with love of the same Mystery to receive it according
          to the custom of the religious life, they are not to be restrained,
          as we said before. For as in the Old Testament the outward works
          are observed, so in the New Testament, that which is outwardly
          done, is not so diligently regarded as that which is inwardly
          thought, that the punishment may be with discernment. For whereas
          the Law forbids the eating of many things as unclean, yet our Lord
          says in the Gospel, <span class="tei tei-q">“Not that which goeth
          into the mouth defileth <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page059">[pg
          059]</span><a name="Pg059" id="Pg059" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> a
          man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a
          man.”</span> And afterwards he added, expounding the same,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Out of the heart proceed evil
          thoughts.”</span> Where it is abundantly shown, that that is
          declared by Almighty God to be polluted in deed, which springs from
          the root of a polluted thought. Whence also Paul the Apostle says,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Unto the pure all things are pure, but
          unto them that are defiled and unbelieving, nothing is
          pure.”</span> And presently, declaring the cause of that
          defilement, he adds, <span class="tei tei-q">“For even their mind
          and conscience is defiled.”</span> If, therefore, meat is not
          unclean to him whose mind is not unclean, why shall that which a
          woman suffers according to nature, with a clean mind, be imputed to
          her as uncleanness?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A man who has
          approached his own wife is not to enter the church unless washed
          with water, nor is he to enter immediately although washed. The Law
          prescribed to the ancient people, that a man in such cases should
          be washed with water, and not enter into the church before the
          setting of the sun. Which, nevertheless, may be understood
          spiritually, because a man acts so when the mind is led by the
          imagination to unlawful concupiscence; for unless the fire of
          concupiscence be first driven from his mind, he is not to think
          himself worthy of the congregation of the brethren, while he sees
          himself burdened by the iniquity of a perverted will. For though
          divers nations have divers opinions concerning this affair, and
          seem to observe different rules, it was always the custom of the
          Romans, from ancient times, for such an one to seek to be cleansed
          by washing, and for some time reverently to forbear entering the
          church. Nor do we, in so saying, assign matrimony to be a fault;
          but forasmuch as lawful intercourse cannot be had without the
          pleasure of the flesh, it is proper to forbear entering the holy
          place, because the pleasure itself cannot be without a fault. For
          he was not born of adultery or fornication, but of lawful marriage,
          who said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Behold I was conceived in
          iniquity, and in sin my mother brought me forth.”</span> For he who
          knew himself to have been conceived in iniquity, lamented that he
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page060">[pg 060]</span><a name="Pg060" id="Pg060" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> was born from sin,
          because he bears the defect, as a tree bears in its bough the sap
          it drew from the root. In which words, however, he does not call
          the union of the married couple iniquity, but the will itself. For
          there are many things which are lawful and permitted, and yet we
          are somewhat defiled in doing them. As very often by being angry we
          correct faults, and at the same time disturb our own peace of mind;
          and though that which we do is right, yet it is not to be approved
          that our mind should be disturbed. For he who said, <span class="tei tei-q">“My eye was disturbed with anger,”</span> had been
          angry at the vices of sinners. Now, seeing that only a calm mind
          can rest in the light of contemplation, he grieved that his eye was
          disturbed with anger; because, whilst he was correcting evil
          actions below, he was obliged to be confused and disturbed with
          regard to the contemplation of the highest things. Anger against
          vice is, therefore, commendable, and yet painful to a man, because
          he thinks that by his mind being agitated, he has incurred some
          guilt. Lawful commerce, therefore, must be for the sake of
          children, not of pleasure; and must be to procure offspring, not to
          satisfy vices. But if any man is led not by the desire of pleasure,
          but only for the sake of getting children, such a man is certainly
          to be left to his own judgement, either as to entering the church,
          or as to receiving the Mystery of the Body and Blood of our Lord,
          which he, who being placed in the fire cannot burn, is not to be
          forbidden by us to receive. But when, not the love of getting
          children, but of pleasure prevails, the pair have cause to lament
          their deed. For this the holy preaching concedes to them, and yet
          fills the mind with dread of the very concession. For when Paul the
          Apostle said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Let him that cannot contain
          have his own wife;”</span> he presently took care to subjoin,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“But this I say by way of permission, not
          of commandment.”</span> For that is not granted by way of
          permission which is lawful, because it is just; and, therefore,
          that which he said he permitted, he showed to be an offence.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is seriously
          to be considered, that when God was about to speak to the people on
          Mount Sinai, He first <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page061">[pg
          061]</span><a name="Pg061" id="Pg061" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          commanded them to abstain from women. And if purity of body was
          there so carefully required, where God spoke to the people by the
          means of a creature as His representative, that those who were to
          hear the words of God should abstain; how much more ought women,
          who receive the Body of Almighty God, to preserve themselves in
          purity of flesh, lest they be burdened with the very greatness of
          that inestimable Mystery? For this reason also, it was said to
          David, concerning his men, by the priest, that if they were clean
          in this particular, they should receive the shewbread, which they
          would not have received at all, had not David first declared them
          to be clean. Then the man, who, afterwards, has been washed with
          water, is also capable of receiving the Mystery of the Holy
          Communion, when it is lawful for him, according to what has been
          before declared, to enter the church.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Augustine's Ninth
          Question.</span></span>—Whether after an illusion, such as is wont
          to happen in a dream, any man may receive the Body of our Lord, or
          if he be a priest, celebrate the Divine Mysteries?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Gregory
          answers.</span></span>—The Testament of the Old Law, as has been
          said already in the article above, calls such a man polluted, and
          allows him not to enter into the church till the evening, after
          being washed with water. Which, nevertheless, a spiritual people,
          taking in another sense, will understand in the same manner as
          above; because he is imposed upon as it were in a dream, who, being
          tempted with uncleanness, is defiled by real representations in
          thought, and he is to be washed with water, that he may cleanse
          away the sins of thought with tears; and unless the fire of
          temptation depart before, may know himself to be in a manner guilty
          until the evening. But a distinction is very necessary in that
          illusion, and one must carefully consider what causes it to arise
          in the mind of the person sleeping; for sometimes it proceeds from
          excess of eating or drinking; sometimes from the superfluity or
          infirmity of nature, and sometimes from the thoughts. And when it
          happens either through superfluity or infirmity of nature, such an
          illusion is not <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page062">[pg
          062]</span><a name="Pg062" id="Pg062" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          to be feared at all, because it is to be lamented, that the mind of
          the person, who knew nothing of it, suffers the same, rather than
          that he occasioned it. But when the appetite of gluttony commits
          excess in food, and thereupon the receptacles of the humours are
          oppressed, the mind thence contracts some guilt; yet not so much as
          to hinder the receiving of the Holy Mystery, or celebrating Mass,
          when a holy day requires it, or necessity obliges the Mystery to be
          shown forth, because there is no other priest in the place; for if
          there be others who can perform the ministry, the illusion
          proceeding from over-eating ought not to exclude a man from
          receiving the sacred Mystery; but I am of opinion he ought humbly
          to abstain from offering the sacrifice of the Mystery, but not from
          receiving it, unless the mind of the person sleeping has been
          disturbed with some foul imagination. For there are some, who for
          the most part so suffer the illusion, that their mind, even during
          the sleep of the body, is not defiled with filthy thoughts. In
          which case, one thing is evident, that the mind is guilty, not
          being acquitted even in its own judgement; for though it does not
          remember to have seen anything whilst the body was sleeping, yet it
          calls to mind that, when the body was awake, it fell into gluttony.
          But if the illusion of the sleeper proceeds from evil thoughts when
          he was awake, then its guilt is manifest to the mind; for the man
          perceives from what root that defilement sprang, because what he
          had consciously thought of, that he afterwards unconsciously
          endured. But it is to be considered, whether that thought was no
          more than a suggestion, or proceeded to delight, or, what is worse,
          consented to sin. For all sin is committed in three ways, viz., by
          suggestion, by delight, and by consent. Suggestion comes from the
          Devil, delight from the flesh, and consent from the spirit. For the
          serpent suggested the first offence, and Eve, as flesh, took
          delight in it, but Adam, as the spirit, consented. And when the
          mind sits in judgement on itself, it must clearly distinguish
          between suggestion and delight, and between delight and consent.
          For when the evil spirit suggests a sin to the mind, if there ensue
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page063">[pg 063]</span><a name="Pg063" id="Pg063" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> no delight in the
          sin, the sin is in no way committed; but when the flesh begins to
          take delight in it, then sin begins to arise. But if it
          deliberately consents, then the sin is known to be full-grown. The
          seed, therefore, of sin is in the suggestion, the nourishment of it
          in delight, its maturity in the consent. And it often happens that
          what the evil spirit sows in the thought, in that the flesh begins
          to find delight, and yet the soul does not consent to that delight.
          And whereas the flesh cannot be delighted without the mind, yet the
          mind struggling against the pleasures of the flesh, is after a
          manner unwillingly bound by the carnal delight, so that through
          reason it opposes it, and does not consent, yet being bound by
          delight, it grievously laments being so bound. Wherefore that great
          soldier of our Lord's host, groaned and said, <span class="tei tei-q">“I see another law in my members warring against the
          law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin,
          which is in my members.”</span> Now if he was a captive, he did not
          fight; but he did fight; wherefore he was a captive and at the same
          time therefore fought against the law of the mind, which the law
          that is in the members opposed; but if he fought, he was no
          captive. Thus, then, man is, as I may say, a captive and yet free.
          Free on account of justice, which he loves, a captive by the
          delight which he unwillingly bears within him.</p>

          With how much kindness brethren, coming of their own accord, are to
          be entertained, is shown by this, that they are for the most part
          invited for the sake of brotherly love. Therefore, if our common
          brother, Bishop Augustine, shall happen to come to you, let your
          love, as is becoming, receive him with so great kindness and
          affection, that it may refresh him by the benefit of its
          consolation and show to others how brotherly charity is to be
          cultivated. And, since it often happens that those who are at a
          distance first learn from others the things that need correction,
          if he bring before you, my brother, any sins of bishops or others,
          do you, in conjunction with him, carefully inquire into the same,
          and show yourself so strict and earnest with regard to those things
          which offend God and provoke His wrath, that for the amendment of
          others, the punishment may fall upon the guilty, and the innocent
          may not suffer under false report. God keep you in safety, most
          reverend brother. Given the 22nd day of June, in the nineteenth

          rewards of the eternal kingdom are reserved for those who labour
          for Almighty God, yet it is requisite that we bestow on them the
          benefit of honours, to the end that they may by this recompense be
          encouraged the more vigorously to apply themselves to the care of
          their spiritual work. And, seeing that the new Church of the
          English is, through the bounty of the Lord, and your labours,
          brought to the grace of God, we grant you the use of the pall in
          the same, only for the celebration of the solemn service of the
          Mass; that so you may ordain twelve bishops in different places,
          who shall be subject to your jurisdiction. But the bishop of London
          shall, for the future, be always consecrated by his own synod, and
          receive the pall, which is the token of his office, from this holy
          and Apostolic see, which I, by the grace of God, now serve. But we
          would have you send to the city of York such a bishop as you shall
          think fit to ordain; yet so, that if that city, with the places
          adjoining, shall receive the Word of God, that bishop shall also
          ordain twelve bishops, and enjoy the honour of a metropolitan; for
          we design, if we live, by the help of God, to bestow on him also
          the pall; and yet we would have him to be subject to your
          authority, my brother; but after your decease, he shall so preside
          over the bishops he shall have ordained, as to be in no way subject
          to the jurisdiction of the bishop of London. But for the future let
          there be this distinction as regards honour between the bishops of
          the cities of London and York, that he who has been <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page066">[pg 066]</span><a name="Pg066" id="Pg066" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> first ordained have the

          a letter worthy to be recorded, wherein he plainly shows how
          carefully he watched over the salvation of our country. The letter
          was as follows:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">To his most beloved son, the Abbot Mellitus;
          Gregory, the servant of the servants of God.</span></span> We have
          been much concerned, since the departure of our people that are
          with you, because we have received no account of the success of
          your journey. Howbeit, when Almighty God has led you to the most
          reverend Bishop Augustine, our brother, tell him what I have long
          been considering <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page067">[pg
          067]</span><a name="Pg067" id="Pg067" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          in my own mind concerning the matter of the English people; to wit,
          that the temples of the idols in that nation ought not to be
          destroyed; but let the idols that are in them be destroyed; let
          water be consecrated and sprinkled in the said temples, let altars
          be erected, and relics placed there. For if those temples are well
          built, it is requisite that they be converted from the worship of
          devils to the service of the true God; that the nation, seeing that
          their temples are not destroyed, may remove error from their
          hearts, and knowing and adoring the true God, may the more freely
          resort to the places to which they have been accustomed. And
          because they are used to slaughter many oxen in sacrifice to
          devils, some solemnity must be given them in exchange for this, as
          that on the day of the dedication, or the nativities of the holy
          martyrs, whose relics are there deposited, they should build
          themselves huts of the boughs of trees about those churches which
          have been turned to that use from being temples, and celebrate the
          solemnity with religious feasting, and no more offer animals to the
          Devil, but kill cattle and glorify God in their feast, and return
          thanks to the Giver of all things for their abundance; to the end
          that, whilst some outward gratifications are retained, they may the
          more easily consent to the inward joys. For there is no doubt that
          it is impossible to cut off every thing at once from their rude
          natures; because he who endeavours to ascend to the highest place
          rises by degrees or steps, and not by leaps. Thus the Lord made
          Himself known to the people of Israel in Egypt; and yet He allowed
          them the use, in His own worship, of the sacrifices which they were
          wont to offer to the Devil, commanding them in His sacrifice to
          kill animals, to the end that, with changed hearts, they might lay
          aside one part of the sacrifice, whilst they retained another; and
          although the animals were the same as those which they were wont to
          offer, they should offer them to the true God, and not to idols;
          and thus they would no longer be the same sacrifices. This then,
          dearly beloved, it behoves you to communicate to our aforesaid
          brother, that he, being placed where he is at <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page068">[pg 068]</span><a name="Pg068" id="Pg068" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> present, may consider how he is to

          letter was in these words:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I know, dearly beloved brother, that Almighty God, by
          means of you, shows forth great miracles to the nation which it was
          His will to choose. Wherefore you must needs rejoice with fear, and
          fear with joy concerning that heavenly gift; for you will rejoice
          because the souls of the English are by outward miracles drawn to
          inward grace; but you will fear, lest, amidst the wonders that are
          wrought, the weak mind may be puffed up with self-esteem, and that
          whereby it is outwardly raised to honour cause it inwardly to fall
          through vain-glory. For we must call to mind, that when the
          disciples returned with joy from preaching, and said to their
          Heavenly Master, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Lord, even the devils are
          subject to us through Thy Name;’</span> forthwith they received the
          reply, <span class="tei tei-q">‘In this rejoice not; but rather

          their minds were set on private and temporal joys, when they

          <span class="tei tei-q">‘Rejoice in this, because your names are

          and yet the names of all are written in heaven. For those who are
          disciples of the truth ought not to rejoice, save for that good
          thing which all men enjoy as well as they, and in which their joy
          shall be without end.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“It remains, therefore, most dear brother, that amidst

          carefully understand both what you are yourself, and how much grace
          is bestowed upon that same nation, for the conversion of which you
          have received even the gift of working miracles. And if you
          remember that you have at any time sinned against our Creator,

          heart. And whatsoever gift of working miracles you either shall
          receive, or have received, consider the same, not as conferred on

          know to have come to pass in the English nation, over whom your
          Highness was placed, to the end, that by <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page070">[pg 070]</span><a name="Pg070" id="Pg070" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> means of the blessings which are granted to
          you, heavenly benefits might also be conferred on your subjects.
          Therefore, my illustrious son, do you carefully guard the grace
          which you have received from the Divine goodness, and be eager to
          spread the Christian faith among the people under your rule; in all
          uprightness increase your zeal for their conversion; suppress the
          worship of idols; overthrow the structures of the temples;
          establish the manners of your subjects by much cleanness of life,
          exhorting, terrifying, winning, correcting, and showing forth an
          example of good works, that you may obtain your reward in Heaven
          from Him, Whose Name and the knowledge of Whom you have spread
          abroad upon earth. For He, Whose honour you seek and maintain among
          the nations, will also render your Majesty's name more glorious
          even to posterity.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“For even so the most pious emperor, Constantine, of
          old, recovering the Roman commonwealth from the false worship of
          idols, brought it with himself into subjection to Almighty God, our
          Lord Jesus Christ, and turned to Him with his whole mind, together
          with the nations under his rule. Whence it followed, that his
          praises transcended the fame of former princes; and he excelled his
          predecessors in renown as much as in good works. Now, therefore,
          let your Highness hasten to impart to the kings and peoples that
          are subject to you, the knowledge of one God, Father, Son, and Holy
          Ghost; that you may surpass the ancient kings of your nation in
          praise and merit, and while you cause the sins of others among your
          own subjects to be blotted out, become the more free from anxiety
          with regard to your own sins before the dread judgement of Almighty
          God.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Willingly hear, devoutly perform, and studiously
          retain in your memory, whatsoever counsel shall be given you by our
          most reverend brother, Bishop Augustine, who is trained up in the
          monastic rule, full of the knowledge of Holy Scripture, and, by the
          help of God, endued with good works; for if you give ear to him
          when he speaks on behalf of Almighty God, the sooner will Almighty
          God hear his prayers for you. But if (which God <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page071">[pg 071]</span><a name="Pg071" id="Pg071" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> forbid!) you slight his words, how
          shall Almighty God hear him on your behalf, when you neglect to
          hear him on behalf of God? Unite yourself, therefore, to him with
          all your mind, in the fervour of faith, and further his endeavours,
          by that virtue which God has given you, that He may make you
          partaker of His kingdom, Whose faith you cause to be received and
          maintained in your own.</span></p>

          of this present world, and the kingdom of the saints, which will
          never come to an end, is at hand. But as the end of the world draws
          near, many things are about to come upon us which were not before,
          to wit, changes in the air, and terrors from heaven, and tempests
          out of the order of the seasons, wars, famines, pestilences,
          earthquakes in divers places; which things will not, nevertheless,
          all happen in our days, but will all follow after our days. If,
          therefore, you perceive that any of these things come to pass in
          your country, let not your mind be in any way disturbed; for these
          signs of the end of the world are sent before, for this reason,
          that we may take heed to our souls, and be watchful for the hour of
          death, and may be found prepared with good works to meet our Judge.
          Thus much, my illustrious son, I have said in few words, with
          intent that when the Christian faith is spread abroad in your
          kingdom, our discourse to you may also be more copious, and we may
          desire to say the more, as joy for the full conversion of your

          whom, seeing that by his zeal he converted our nation, the English,
          from the power of Satan to the faith of Christ, it behoves us to
          discourse more at large in our Ecclesiastical History, for we may
          rightly, nay, we must, call him our apostle; because, as soon as he
          began to wield the pontifical power over all the world, and was
          placed over the Churches long before converted to the true faith,
          he made our nation, till then enslaved to idols, the Church of
          Christ, so that concerning him we may use those words of the
          Apostle; <span class="tei tei-q">“if he be not an apostle to
          others, yet doubtless he is to us; for the seal of his apostleship
          are we in the Lord.”</span><a id="noteref_145" name="noteref_145" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_145"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">145</span></span></a></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He was by nation
          a Roman, son of Gordianus, tracing his descent from ancestors that
          were not only noble, but religious. Moreover Felix, once bishop of
          the same Apostolic see, a man of great honour in Christ and in the
          Church, was his forefather.<a id="noteref_146" name="noteref_146" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_146"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">146</span></span></a> Nor
          did he show his <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page076">[pg
          076]</span><a name="Pg076" id="Pg076" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          nobility in religion by less strength of devotion than his parents
          and kindred. But that nobility of this world which was seen in him,
          by the help of the Divine Grace, he used only to gain the glory of
          eternal dignity; for soon quitting his secular habit, he entered a
          monastery, wherein he began to live with so much grace of
          perfection that (as he was wont afterwards with tears to testify)
          his mind was above all transitory things; that he rose superior to
          all that is subject to change; that he used to think of nothing but
          what was heavenly; that, whilst detained by the body, he broke
          through the bonds of the flesh by contemplation; and that he even
          loved death, which is a penalty to almost all men, as the entrance
          into life, and the reward of his labours. This he used to say of
          himself, not to boast of his progress in virtue, but rather to
          bewail the falling off which he imagined he had sustained through
          his pastoral charge. Indeed, once in a private conversation with
          his deacon, Peter, after having enumerated the former virtues of
          his soul, he added sorrowfully, <span class="tei tei-q">“But now,
          on account of the pastoral charge, it is entangled with the affairs
          of laymen, and, after so fair an appearance of inward peace, is
          defiled with the dust of earthly action. And having wasted itself
          on outward things, by turning aside to the affairs of many men,
          even when it desires the inward things, it returns to them
          undoubtedly impaired. I therefore consider what I endure, I
          consider what I have lost, and when I behold what I have thrown
          away, that which I bear appears the more grievous.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So spake the
          holy man constrained by his great humility. But it behoves us to
          believe that he lost nothing of his monastic perfection by reason
          of his pastoral charge, but rather that he gained greater profit
          through the labour of converting many, than by the former calm of
          his private life, and chiefly because, whilst holding the
          pontifical office, he set about organizing his house like a
          monastery. And when first drawn from the monastery, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page077">[pg 077]</span><a name="Pg077" id="Pg077" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> ordained to the ministry of the altar,
          and sent to Constantinople as representative<a id="noteref_147" name="noteref_147" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_147"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">147</span></span></a> of
          the Apostolic see, though he now took part in the secular affairs
          of the palace, yet he did not abandon the fixed course of his
          heavenly life; for some of the brethren of his monastery, who had
          followed him to the royal city in their brotherly love, he employed
          for the better observance of monastic rule, to the end that at all
          times, by their example, as he writes himself, he might be held
          fast to the calm shore of prayer, as it were, with the cable of an
          anchor, whilst he should be tossed up and down by the ceaseless
          waves of worldly affairs; and daily in the intercourse of studious
          reading with them, strengthen his mind shaken with temporal
          concerns. By their company he was not only guarded against the
          assaults of the world, but more and more roused to the exercises of
          a heavenly life.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For they
          persuaded him to interpret by a mystical exposition the book of the
          blessed Job,<a id="noteref_148" name="noteref_148" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_148"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">148</span></span></a> which
          is involved in great obscurity; nor could he refuse to undertake
          that work, which brotherly affection imposed on him for the future
          benefit of many; but in a wonderful manner, in five and thirty
          books of exposition, he taught how that same book is to be
          understood literally; how to be referred to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page078">[pg 078]</span><a name="Pg078" id="Pg078" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the mysteries of Christ and the Church;
          and in what sense it is to be adapted to every one of the faithful.
          This work he began as papal representative in the royal city, but
          finished it at Rome after being made pope. Whilst he was still in
          the royal city, by the help of the grace of Catholic truth, he
          crushed in its first rise a new heresy which sprang up there,
          concerning the state of our resurrection. For Eutychius,<a id="noteref_149" name="noteref_149" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_149"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">149</span></span></a>
          bishop of that city, taught, that our body, in the glory of
          resurrection, would be impalpable, and more subtile than wind and
          air. The blessed Gregory hearing this, proved by force of truth,
          and by the instance of the Resurrection of our Lord, that this
          doctrine was every way opposed to the orthodox faith. For the
          Catholic faith holds that our body, raised by the glory of
          immortality, is indeed rendered subtile by the effect of spiritual
          power, but is palpable by the reality of nature; according to the
          example of our Lord's Body, concerning which, when risen from the
          dead, He Himself says to His disciples, <span class="tei tei-q">“Handle Me and see, for a spirit hath not flesh and
          bones, as ye see Me have.”</span><a id="noteref_150" name="noteref_150" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_150"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">150</span></span></a> In
          maintaining this faith, the venerable Father Gregory so earnestly
          strove against the rising heresy, and with the help of the most
          pious emperor, Tiberius Constantine,<a id="noteref_151" name="noteref_151" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_151"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">151</span></span></a> so
          fully suppressed it, that none has been since found to revive
          it.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He likewise
          composed another notable book, the <span class="tei tei-q">“Liber
          Pastoralis,”</span> wherein he clearly showed what sort of persons
          ought to be preferred to rule the Church; how such rulers ought to
          live; with how much discrimination they ought to instruct the
          different classes of their hearers, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page079">[pg 079]</span><a name="Pg079" id="Pg079" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and how seriously to reflect every day on
          their own frailty. He also wrote forty homilies on the Gospel,
          which he divided equally into two volumes; and composed four books
          of Dialogues, in which, at the request of his deacon, Peter, he
          recounted the virtues of the more renowned saints of Italy, whom he
          had either known or heard of, as a pattern of life for posterity;
          to the end that, as he taught in his books of Expositions what
          virtues men ought to strive after, so by describing the miracles of
          saints, he might make known the glory of those virtues. Further, in
          twenty-two homilies, he showed how much light is latent in the
          first and last parts of the prophet Ezekiel, which seemed the most
          obscure. Besides which, he wrote the <span class="tei tei-q">“Book
          of Answers,”</span><a id="noteref_152" name="noteref_152" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_152"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">152</span></span></a> to
          the questions of the holy Augustine, the first bishop of the
          English nation, as we have shown above, inserting the same book
          entire in this history; and the useful little <span class="tei tei-q">“Synodical Book,”</span><a id="noteref_153" name="noteref_153" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_153"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">153</span></span></a> which
          he composed with the bishops of Italy on necessary matters of the
          Church; as well as private letters to certain persons. And it is
          the more wonderful that he could write so many lengthy works,
          seeing that almost all the time of his youth, to use his own words,
          he was frequently tormented with internal pain, constantly
          enfeebled by the weakness of his digestion, and oppressed by a low
          but persistent fever. But in all these troubles, forasmuch as he
          carefully reflected that, as the Scripture testifies,<a id="noteref_154" name="noteref_154" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_154"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">154</span></span></a>
          <span class="tei tei-q">“He scourgeth every son whom He
          receiveth,”</span> the more severely he suffered under those
          present evils, the more he assured himself of his eternal hope.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus much may be
          said of his immortal genius, which could not be crushed by such
          severe bodily pains. Other popes applied themselves to building
          churches or adorning them with gold and silver, but Gregory was
          wholly intent upon gaining souls. Whatsoever money he had,
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page080">[pg 080]</span><a name="Pg080" id="Pg080" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> he took care to
          distribute diligently and give to the poor, that his righteousness
          might endure for ever, and his horn be exalted with honour; so that
          the words of the blessed Job might be truly said of him,<a id="noteref_155" name="noteref_155" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_155"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">155</span></span></a>
          <span class="tei tei-q">“When the ear heard me, then it blessed me;
          and when the eye saw me, it gave witness to me: because I delivered
          the poor that cried, and the fatherless, and him that had none to
          help him. The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon
          me, and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy. I put on
          righteousness, and it clothed me; my judgement was as a robe and a
          diadem. I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame. I was
          a father to the poor; and the cause which I knew not, I searched
          out. And I brake the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out
          of his teeth.”</span> And a little after: <span class="tei tei-q">“If I have withheld,”</span> says he, <span class="tei tei-q">“the poor from their desire; or have caused the eyes of
          the widow to fail; or have eaten my morsel myself alone, and the
          fatherless hath not eaten thereof: (for from my youth compassion
          grew up with me, and from my mother's womb it came forth with
          me.”</span><a id="noteref_156" name="noteref_156" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_156"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">156</span></span></a>)</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To his works of
          piety and righteousness this also may be added, that he saved our
          nation, by the preachers he sent hither, from the teeth of the old
          enemy, and made it partaker of eternal liberty. Rejoicing in the
          faith and salvation of our race, and worthily commending it with
          praise, he says, in his exposition of the blessed Job, <span class="tei tei-q">“Behold, the tongue of Britain, which only knew how to
          utter barbarous cries, has long since begun to raise the Hebrew
          Hallelujah to the praise of God! Behold, the once swelling ocean
          now serves prostrate at the feet of the saints; and its wild
          upheavals, which earthly princes could not subdue with the sword,
          are now, through the fear of God, bound by the lips of priests with
          words alone; and the heathen that stood not in awe of troops of
          warriors, now believes and fears the tongues of the humble! For he
          has received a message from on high <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page081">[pg 081]</span><a name="Pg081" id="Pg081" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and mighty works are revealed; the strength
          of the knowledge of God is given him, and restrained by the fear of
          the Lord, he dreads to do evil, and with all his heart desires to
          attain to everlasting grace.”</span> In which words the blessed
          Gregory shows us this also, that St. Augustine and his companions
          brought the English to receive the truth, not only by the preaching
          of words, but also by showing forth heavenly signs.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The blessed Pope
          Gregory, among other things, caused Masses to be celebrated in the
          churches of the holy Apostles, Peter and Paul, over their bodies.
          And in the celebration of Masses, he added three petitions of the
          utmost perfection: <span class="tei tei-q">“And dispose our days in
          thy peace, and bid us to be preserved from eternal damnation, and
          to be numbered in the flock of thine elect.”</span><a id="noteref_157" name="noteref_157" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_157"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">157</span></span></a></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He governed the
          Church in the days of the Emperors Mauritius and Phocas, and
          passing out of this life in the second year of the same
          Phocas,<a id="noteref_158" name="noteref_158" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_158"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">158</span></span></a> he
          departed to the true life which is in Heaven. His body was buried
          in the church of the blessed Apostle Peter before the sacristy, on
          the 12th day of March, to rise one day in the same body in glory
          with the rest of the holy pastors of the Church. On his tomb was
          written this epitaph:</p>

          <div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em">

          thine own; thou canst restore it, when God calls to life. His
          spirit rises to the stars; the claims of death shall not avail
          against him, for death itself is but the way to new life. In this
          tomb are laid the limbs of a great pontiff, who yet lives for ever
          in all places in countless deeds of mercy. Hunger and cold he
          overcame with food and raiment, and shielded souls from the enemy
          by his holy teaching. And whatsoever he taught in word, that he
          fulfilled in deed, that he might be a pattern, even as he spake
          words of mystic meaning. By his</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page082">[pg 082]</span><a name="Pg082" id="Pg082" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-size: 90%">guiding love he
            brought the Angles to Christ, gaining armies for the Faith from a
            new people. This was thy toil, thy task, thy care, thy aim as
            shepherd, to offer to thy Lord abundant increase of the flock.
            So, Consul of God, rejoice in this thy triumph, for now thou hast
            the reward of thy works for evermore.</span>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nor must we pass
          by in silence the story of the blessed Gregory, handed down to us
          by the tradition of our ancestors, which explains his earnest care
          for the salvation of our nation. It is said that one day, when some
          merchants had lately arrived at Rome, many things were exposed for
          sale in the market place, and much people resorted thither to buy:
          Gregory himself went with the rest, and saw among other wares some
          boys put up for sale, of fair complexion, with pleasing
          countenances, and very beautiful hair. When he beheld them, he
          asked, it is said, from what region or country they were brought?
          and was told, from the island of Britain, and that the inhabitants
          were like that in appearance. He again inquired whether those
          islanders were Christians, or still involved in the errors of
          paganism, and was informed that they were pagans. Then fetching a
          deep sigh from the bottom of his heart, <span class="tei tei-q">“Alas! what pity,”</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“that the author of darkness should own men of such
          fair countenances; and that with such grace of outward form, their
          minds should be void of inward grace.”</span> He therefore again
          asked, what was the name of that nation? and was answered, that
          they were called Angles. <span class="tei tei-q">“Right,”</span>
          said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“for they have an angelic face,
          and it is meet that such should be co-heirs with the Angels in
          heaven. What is the name of the province from which they are
          brought?”</span> It was replied, that the natives of that province
          were called Deiri.<a id="noteref_159" name="noteref_159" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_159"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">159</span></span></a>
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Truly are they <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">De
          ira</span></span>,”</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“saved
          from wrath, and called to the mercy of Christ. How is the king of
          that province <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page083">[pg
          083]</span><a name="Pg083" id="Pg083" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          called?”</span> They told him his name was Aelli;<a id="noteref_160" name="noteref_160" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_160"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">160</span></span></a> and
          he, playing upon the name, said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Allelujah, the praise of God the Creator must be sung
          in those parts.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then he went to
          the bishop of the Roman Apostolic see<a id="noteref_161" name="noteref_161" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_161"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">161</span></span></a> (for
          he was not himself then made pope), and entreated him to send some
          ministers of the Word into Britain to the nation of the English,
          that it might be converted to Christ by them; declaring himself
          ready to carry out that work with the help of God, if the Apostolic
          Pope should think fit to have it done. But not being then able to
          perform this task, because, though the Pope was willing to grant
          his request, yet the citizens of Rome could not be brought to
          consent that he should depart so far from the city, as soon as he
          was himself made Pope, he carried out the long-desired work,
          sending, indeed, other preachers, but himself by his exhortations
          and prayers helping the preaching to bear fruit. This account,
          which we have received from a past generation, we have thought fit
          to insert in our Ecclesiastical History.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the meantime,
          Augustine, with the help of King Ethelbert, drew together to a

          preserve Catholic peace with him, and undertake the common labour
          of preaching the Gospel to the heathen for the Lord's sake. For
          they did not keep Easter Sunday at the proper time, but from the
          fourteenth to the twentieth moon; which computation is contained in
          a cycle of eighty-four years.<a id="noteref_164" name="noteref_164" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_164"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">164</span></span></a>
          Besides, they did many other things <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page085">[pg 085]</span><a name="Pg085" id="Pg085" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> which were opposed to the unity of the
          church.<a id="noteref_165" name="noteref_165" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_165"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">165</span></span></a> When,
          after a long disputation, they did not comply with the entreaties,
          exhortations, or rebukes of Augustine and his companions, but
          preferred their own traditions before all the Churches which are
          united in Christ throughout the world, the holy father, Augustine,
          put an end to this troublesome and tedious contention, saying,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Let us entreat God, who maketh men to be
          of one mind in His Father's house, to vouchsafe, by signs from
          Heaven, to declare to us which tradition is to be followed; and by
          what path we are to strive to enter His kingdom. Let some sick man
          be brought, and let the faith and practice of him, by whose prayers
          he shall be healed, be looked upon as hallowed in God's sight and
          such as should be adopted by all.”</span> His adversaries
          unwillingly consenting, a blind man of the English race was
          brought, who having been presented to the British bishops, found no
          benefit or healing from their ministry; at length, Augustine,
          compelled by strict necessity, bowed his knees to the Father of our
          Lord Jesus Christ, praying that He would restore his lost sight to
          the blind man, and by the bodily enlightenment of one kindle the
          grace of spiritual light in the hearts of many of the faithful.
          Immediately the blind man received sight, and Augustine was
          proclaimed by all to be a true herald of the light from Heaven. The
          Britons then confessed that they perceived that it was the
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page086">[pg 086]</span><a name="Pg086" id="Pg086" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> true way of
          righteousness which Augustine taught; but that they could not
          depart from their ancient customs without the consent and sanction
          of their people. They therefore desired that a second time a synod
          might be appointed, at which more of their number should be
          present.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This being
          decreed, there came, it is said, seven bishops of the
          Britons,<a id="noteref_166" name="noteref_166" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_166"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">166</span></span></a> and
          many men of great learning, particularly from their most celebrated
          monastery, which is called, in the English tongue,
          Bancornaburg,<a id="noteref_167" name="noteref_167" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_167"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">167</span></span></a> and
          over which the Abbot Dinoot<a id="noteref_168" name="noteref_168" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_168"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">168</span></span></a> is
          said to have presided at that time. They that were to go to the
          aforesaid council, betook themselves first to a certain holy and
          discreet man, who was wont to lead the life of a hermit among them,
          to consult with him, whether they ought, at the preaching of
          Augustine, to forsake their traditions. He answered, <span class="tei tei-q">“If he is a man of God, follow
          him.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“How shall we know
          that?”</span> said they. He replied, <span class="tei tei-q">“Our
          Lord saith, Take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me, for I am meek
          and lowly in heart; if therefore, Augustine is meek and lowly of
          heart, it is to be believed that he bears the yoke of Christ
          himself, and offers it to you to bear. But, if he is harsh and
          proud, it is plain that he is not of God, nor are we to regard his
          words.”</span> They said again, <span class="tei tei-q">“And how
          shall we discern even this?”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Do you
          contrive,”</span> said the anchorite, <span class="tei tei-q">“that
          he first arrive with his company at the place where the synod is to
          be held; and if at your approach he rises up to you, hear him
          submissively, being assured that he is the servant of Christ; but
          if he despises you, and does not rise up to you, whereas you are
          more in number, let him also be despised by
          you.”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page087">[pg
          087]</span><a name="Pg087" id="Pg087" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They did as he
          directed; and it happened, that as they approached, Augustine was
          sitting on a chair. When they perceived it, they were angry, and
          charging him with pride, set themselves to contradict all he said.
          He said to them, <span class="tei tei-q">“Many things ye do which
          are contrary to our custom, or rather the custom of the universal
          Church, and yet, if you will comply with me in these three matters,
          to wit, to keep Easter at the due time; to fulfil the ministry of
          Baptism, by which we are born again to God, according to the custom
          of the holy Roman Apostolic Church;<a id="noteref_169" name="noteref_169" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_169"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">169</span></span></a> and
          to join with us in preaching the Word of God to the English nation,
          we will gladly suffer all the other things you do, though contrary
          to our customs.”</span> They answered that they would do none of
          those things, nor receive him as their archbishop; for they said
          among themselves, <span class="tei tei-q">“if he would not rise up
          to us now, how much more will he despise us, as of no account, if
          we begin to be under his subjection?”</span> Then the man of God,
          Augustine, is said to have threatened them, that if they would not
          accept peace with their brethren, they should have war from their
          enemies; and, if they would not preach the way of life to the
          English nation, they should suffer at their hands the vengeance of
          death. All which, through the dispensation of the Divine judgement,
          fell out exactly as he had predicted.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For afterwards
          the warlike king of the English, Ethelfrid,<a id="noteref_170" name="noteref_170" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_170"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">170</span></span></a> of

          called Legacaestir, but by the Britons more rightly Carlegion.
          Being about to give battle, he observed their priests, who were
          come together to offer up their prayers to God for the combatants,
          standing apart in a place of greater safety; he inquired who they
          were, and what they came together to do in that place. Most of them
          were of the monastery of Bangor,<a id="noteref_172" name="noteref_172" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_172"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">172</span></span></a> in
          which, it is said, there was so great a number of monks, that the
          monastery being divided into seven parts, with a superior set over
          each, none of those parts contained less than three hundred men,
          who all lived by the labour of their hands. Many of these, having
          observed a fast of three days, had come together along with others
          to pray at the aforesaid battle, having one Brocmail<a id="noteref_173" name="noteref_173" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_173"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">173</span></span></a> for
          their protector, to defend them, whilst they were intent upon their
          prayers, against the swords of the barbarians. King Ethelfrid being
          informed of the occasion of their coming, said, <span class="tei tei-q">“If then they cry to their God against us, in truth,
          though they do not bear arms, yet they fight against us, because
          they assail us with their curses.”</span> He, therefore, commanded
          them to be attacked first, and then destroyed the rest of the
          impious army, not without great loss of his own forces. About
          twelve hundred of those that came to pray are said to have been
          killed, and only fifty to have escaped by flight. Brocmail, turning
          his back with his men, at the first approach of the enemy, left
          those whom he ought to have defended unarmed and exposed to the
          swords of the assailants. Thus was fulfilled the prophecy of the
          holy Bishop Augustine, though he himself had been long before taken
          up into the heavenly kingdom, that the heretics should feel the
          vengeance of temporal death also, because they had despised the
          offer of eternal salvation.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the year of
          our Lord 604, Augustine, Archbishop of Britain, ordained two
          bishops, to wit, Mellitus and Justus;<a id="noteref_174" name="noteref_174" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_174"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">174</span></span></a>
          Mellitus to preach to the province of the East-Saxons, who are
          divided from Kent by the river Thames, and border on the Eastern
          sea. Their metropolis is the city of London, which is situated on
          the bank of the aforesaid river, and is the mart of many nations
          resorting to it by sea and land. At that time, Sabert, nephew to
          Ethelbert through his sister Ricula, reigned over the nation,
          though he was under subjection to Ethelbert, who, as has been said
          above, had command over all the nations of the English as far as
          the river Humber. But when this province also received the word of
          truth, by the preaching of Mellitus, King Ethelbert built the
          church of St. Paul the Apostle,<a id="noteref_175" name="noteref_175" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_175"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">175</span></span></a> in
          the city of London, where he and his successors should have their
          episcopal see. As for Justus, Augustine ordained him bishop in
          Kent, at the city of Dorubrevis, which the English call
          Hrofaescaestrae,<a id="noteref_176" name="noteref_176" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_176"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">176</span></span></a> from
          one that was formerly the chief man of it, called Hrof. It is about
          twenty-four miles distant from the city of Canterbury to the
          westward, and in it King Ethelbert dedicated a church to the
          blessed Apostle Andrew,<a id="noteref_177" name="noteref_177" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_177"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">177</span></span></a> and
          bestowed many gifts on the bishops of both those churches, as well
          as on the Bishop of Canterbury, adding lands and possessions for
          the use of those who were associated with the bishops.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After this, the
          beloved of God, our father Augustine, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page090">[pg 090]</span><a name="Pg090" id="Pg090" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> died,<a id="noteref_178" name="noteref_178" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_178"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">178</span></span></a> and
          his body was laid outside, close by the church of the blessed
          Apostles, Peter and Paul, above spoken of, because it was not yet
          finished, nor consecrated, but as soon as it was consecrated,<a id="noteref_179" name="noteref_179" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_179"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">179</span></span></a> the

          Almost in the midst of this chapel is an altar dedicated in honour
          of the blessed Pope Gregory, at which every Saturday memorial
          Masses are celebrated for the archbishops by a priest of that
          place. On the tomb of Augustine is inscribed this epitaph:</p>

          succeeded Augustine in the bishopric, having been ordained thereto
          by the latter, in his lifetime, lest, upon his death, the Church,
          as yet in so unsettled a state, might begin to falter, if it should
          be destitute of a pastor, though but for one hour. Wherein he also
          followed the example of the first pastor of the Church, that is, of
          the most blessed Peter, chief of the Apostles, who, having founded
          the Church of Christ at Rome, is said to have consecrated Clement
          to help him in preaching the Gospel, and at the same time to be his
          successor. Laurentius, being advanced to the rank of archbishop,
          laboured indefatigably, both by frequent words of holy exhortation
          and constant example of good works to strengthen the foundations of
          the Church, which had been so nobly laid, and to carry it on to the
          fitting height of perfection. In short, he not only took charge of
          the new Church formed among the English, but endeavoured also to
          bestow his pastoral care upon the tribes of the ancient inhabitants
          of Britain, as also of the Scots, who inhabit the island of
          Ireland,<a id="noteref_183" name="noteref_183" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_183"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">183</span></span></a> which
          is next to Britain. For when he understood that the life and
          profession of the Scots in their aforesaid country, as well as of
          the Britons in Britain, was not truly in accordance with the
          practice of the Church in many matters, especially that they did
          not celebrate the festival of Easter at the due time, but thought
          that the day of the Resurrection of our Lord ought, as has been
          said above, to be observed between the 14th and 20th of the moon;
          he wrote, jointly with his fellow bishops, a hortatory epistle,
          entreating and conjuring them to keep the unity of peace and
          Catholic observance with the Church of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page092">[pg 092]</span><a name="Pg092" id="Pg092" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Christ spread throughout the world. The
          beginning of which epistle is as follows:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">To our most dear brethren, the Lords Bishops

          <span style="font-style: italic">Laurentius, Mellitus, and Justus,
          Bishops, servants of the servants of God.</span></span> When the
          Apostolic see, according to the universal custom which it has
          followed elsewhere, sent us to these western parts to preach to
          pagan nations, and it was our lot to come into this island, which
          is called Britain, before we knew them, we held both the Britons
          and Scots in great esteem for sanctity, believing that they walked
          according to the custom of the universal Church; but becoming
          acquainted with the Britons, we thought that the Scots had been
          better. Now we have learnt from Bishop Dagan,<a id="noteref_185" name="noteref_185" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_185"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">185</span></span></a> who
          came into this aforesaid island, and the Abbot Columban,<a id="noteref_186" name="noteref_186" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_186"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">186</span></span></a> in
          Gaul, that the Scots in no way differ from the Britons in their
          walk; for when Bishop Dagan came to us, not only did he refuse to
          eat at the same table, but even to eat in the same house where we
          were entertained.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Also Laurentius
          with his fellow bishops wrote a letter to the bishops of the
          Britons, suitable to his degree, by which he endeavoured to confirm
          them in Catholic unity; but what he gained by so doing the present
          times still show.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the year of
          our Lord 616, which is the twenty-first year after Augustine and
          his company were sent to preach to the English nation, Ethelbert,
          king of Kent, having most gloriously governed his temporal kingdom
          fifty-six years, entered into the eternal joys of the kingdom
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page094">[pg 094]</span><a name="Pg094" id="Pg094" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of Heaven. He was
          the third of the English kings who ruled over all the southern
          provinces that are divided from the northern by the river Humber
          and the borders contiguous to it;<a id="noteref_190" name="noteref_190" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_190"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">190</span></span></a> but
          the first of all that ascended to the heavenly kingdom. The first
          who had the like sovereignty was Aelli, king of the South-Saxons;
          the second, Caelin, king of the West-Saxons, who, in their own
          language, is called Ceaulin; the third, as has been said, was
          Ethelbert, king of Kent; the fourth was Redwald, king of the
          East-Angles, who, even in the life-time of Ethelbert, had been
          acquiring the leadership for his own race. The fifth was Edwin,
          king of the Northumbrian nation, that is, of those who live in the
          district to the north of the river Humber; his power was greater;
          he had the overlordship over all the nations who inhabit Britain,
          both English and British, except only the people of Kent; and he
          reduced also under the dominion of the English, the Mevanian
          Islands<a id="noteref_191" name="noteref_191" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_191"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">191</span></span></a> of
          the Britons, lying between Ireland and Britain; the sixth was
          Oswald, the most Christian king of the Northumbrians, whose kingdom
          was within the same bounds; the seventh, his brother Oswy, ruled
          over a kingdom of like extent for a time, and for the most part
          subdued and made tributary the nations of the Picts and Scots, who
          occupy the northern parts of Britain: but of that hereafter.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">King Ethelbert
          died on the 24th day of the month of February, twenty-one years
          after he had received the faith,<a id="noteref_192" name="noteref_192" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_192"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">192</span></span></a> and
          was buried in St. Martin's chapel within the church of the blessed
          Apostles Peter and Paul, where also lies his queen, Bertha. Among
          other benefits which he <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page095">[pg
          095]</span><a name="Pg095" id="Pg095" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          conferred upon his nation in his care for them, he established,
          with the help of his council of wise men,<a id="noteref_193" name="noteref_193" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_193"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">193</span></span></a>
          judicial decisions, after the Roman model; which are written in the
          language of the English, and are still kept and observed by them.
          Among which, he set down first what satisfaction should be given by
          any one who should steal anything belonging to the Church, the
          bishop, or the other clergy, for he was resolved to give protection
          to those whom he had received along with their doctrine.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This Ethelbert
          was the son of Irminric, whose father was Octa, whose father was
          Oeric, surnamed Oisc, from whom the kings of Kent are wont to be
          called Oiscings.<a id="noteref_194" name="noteref_194" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_194"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">194</span></span></a> His
          father was Hengist, who, being invited by Vortigern, first came
          into Britain, with his son Oisc, as has been said above.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But after the
          death of Ethelbert, the accession of his son Eadbald proved very
          harmful to the still tender growth of the new Church; for he not
          only refused to accept the faith of Christ, but was also defiled
          with such fornication, as the Apostle testifies, as is not so much
          as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's
          wife.<a id="noteref_195" name="noteref_195" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_195"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">195</span></span></a> By
          both which crimes he gave occasion to those to return to their
          former uncleanness, who, under his father, had, either for favour
          or fear of the king, submitted to the laws of the faith and of a
          pure life. Nor did the unbelieving king escape without the scourge
          of Divine severity in chastisement and correction; for he was
          troubled with frequent fits of madness, and possessed by an unclean
          spirit. The storm of this disturbance was increased by the death of
          Sabert, king of the East Saxons, who departing to the heavenly
          kingdom, left three sons, still pagans, to inherit his temporal
          crown. They immediately began openly to give themselves up to
          idolatry, which, during their father's lifetime, they had seemed
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page096">[pg 096]</span><a name="Pg096" id="Pg096" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> somewhat to abandon,
          and they granted free licence to their subjects to serve idols. And
          when they saw the bishop, whilst celebrating Mass in the church,
          give the Eucharist to the people, filled, as they were, with folly
          and ignorance, they said to him, as is commonly reported,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Why do you not give us also that white
          bread, which you used to give to our father Saba (for so they were
          wont to call him), and which you still continue to give to the
          people in the church?”</span> To whom he answered, <span class="tei tei-q">“If you will be washed in that font of salvation, in
          which your father was washed, you may also partake of the holy
          Bread of which he partook; but if you despise the laver of life,
          you can in no wise receive the Bread of life.”</span> They replied,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“We will not enter into that font, because
          we know that we do not stand in need of it, and yet we will be
          refreshed by that bread.”</span> And being often earnestly
          admonished by him, that this could by no means be done, nor would
          any one be admitted to partake of the sacred Oblation without the
          holy cleansing, at last, they said, filled with rage, <span class="tei tei-q">“If you will not comply with us in so small a matter as
          that which we require, you shall not stay in our province.”</span>
          And they drove him out and bade him and his company depart from
          their kingdom. Being driven thence, he came into Kent, to take
          counsel with his fellow bishops, Laurentius and Justus, and learn
          what was to be done in that case; and with one consent they
          determined that it was better for them all to return to their own
          country, where they might serve God in freedom of mind, than to
          continue to no purpose among barbarians, who had revolted from the
          faith. Mellitus and Justus accordingly went away first, and
          withdrew into the parts of Gaul, intending there to await the
          event. But the kings, who had driven from them the herald of the
          truth, did not continue long unpunished in their worship of devils.
          For marching out to battle against the nation of the Gewissi,<a id="noteref_196" name="noteref_196" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_196"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">196</span></span></a> they
          were all slain with their army. Nevertheless, the people,
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page097">[pg 097]</span><a name="Pg097" id="Pg097" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> having been once
          turned to wickedness, though the authors of it were destroyed,
          would not be corrected, nor return to the unity of faith and
          charity which is in Christ.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Laurentius,
          being about to follow Mellitus and Justus, and to quit Britain,
          ordered his bed to be laid that night in the church of the blessed
          Apostles, Peter and Paul, which has been often mentioned before;
          wherein having laid himself to rest, after he had with tears poured
          forth many prayers to God for the state of the Church, he fell
          asleep; in the dead of night, the blessed chief of the Apostles
          appeared to him, and scourging him grievously a long time, asked of
          him with apostolic severity, why he was forsaking the flock which
          he had committed to him? or to what shepherd he was leaving, by his
          flight, Christ's sheep that were in the midst of wolves?
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Hast thou,”</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“forgotten my example, who, for the sake of those
          little ones, whom Christ commended to me in token of His affection,
          underwent at the hands of infidels and enemies of Christ, bonds,
          stripes, imprisonment, afflictions, and lastly, death itself, even
          the death of the cross, that I might at last be crowned with
          Him?”</span> Laurentius, the servant of Christ, roused by the
          scourging of the blessed Peter and his words of exhortation, went
          to the king as soon as morning broke, and laying aside his garment,
          showed the scars of the stripes which he had received. The king,
          astonished, asked who had presumed to inflict such stripes on so
          great a man. And when he heard that for the sake of his salvation
          the bishop had suffered these cruel blows at the hands of the
          Apostle of Christ, he was greatly afraid; and abjuring the worship
          of idols, and renouncing his unlawful marriage, he received the
          faith of Christ, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page098">[pg
          098]</span><a name="Pg098" id="Pg098" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          and being baptized, promoted and supported the interests of the
          Church to the utmost of his power.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He also sent
          over into Gaul, and recalled Mellitus and Justus, and bade them
          return to govern their churches in freedom. They came back one year
          after their departure, and Justus returned to the city of
          Rochester, where he had before presided; but the people of London
          would not receive Bishop Mellitus, choosing rather to be under
          their idolatrous high priests; for King Eadbald had not so much
          authority in the kingdom as his father, and was not able to restore
          the bishop to his church against the will and consent of the
          pagans. But he and his nation, after his conversion to the Lord,
          sought to obey the commandments of God. Lastly, he built the church
          of the holy Mother of God,<a id="noteref_197" name="noteref_197" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_197"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">197</span></span></a> in

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this king's
          reign, the blessed Archbishop Laurentius was taken up to the
          heavenly kingdom: he was buried in the church and monastery of the
          holy Apostle Peter, close by his predecessor Augustine, on the 2nd
          day of the month of February.<a id="noteref_198" name="noteref_198" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_198"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">198</span></span></a>
          Mellitus, who was bishop of London, succeeded to the see of
          Canterbury, being the third archbishop from Augustine; Justus, who
          was still living, governed the church of Rochester. These ruled the
          Church of the English with much care and industry, and received
          letters of exhortation from Boniface,<a id="noteref_199" name="noteref_199" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_199"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">199</span></span></a>
          bishop of the Roman Apostolic see, who presided over the Church
          after Deusdedit, in the year of our Lord 619. Mellitus laboured
          under the bodily infirmity of gout, but his mind was sound and
          active, cheerfully passing over all earthly things, and always
          aspiring to love, seek, and attain to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page099">[pg 099]</span><a name="Pg099" id="Pg099" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> those which are celestial. He was noble by
          birth, but still nobler by the elevation of his mind.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In short, that I
          may give one instance of his power, from which the rest may be
          inferred, it happened once that the city of Canterbury, being set
          on fire through carelessness, was in danger of being consumed by
          the spreading conflagration; water was thrown on the fire in vain;
          a considerable part of the city was already destroyed, and the
          fierce flames were advancing towards the bishop's abode, when he,
          trusting in God, where human help failed, ordered himself to be
          carried towards the raging masses of fire which were spreading on
          every side. The church of the four crowned Martyrs<a id="noteref_200" name="noteref_200" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_200"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">200</span></span></a> was
          in the place where the fire raged most fiercely. The bishop, being
          carried thither by his servants, weak as he was, set about averting
          by prayer the danger which the strong hands of active men had not
          been able to overcome with all their exertions. Immediately the
          wind, which blowing from the south had spread the conflagration
          throughout the city, veered to the north, and thus prevented the
          destruction of those places that had been exposed to its full
          violence, then it ceased entirely and there was a calm, while the
          flames likewise sank and were extinguished. And because the man of
          God burned with the fire of divine love, and was wont to drive away
          the storms of the powers of the air, by his frequent prayers and at
          his bidding, from doing harm to himself, or his people, it was meet
          that he should be allowed to prevail over the winds and flames of
          this world, and to obtain that they should not injure him or
          his.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This archbishop
          also, having ruled the church five years, departed to heaven in the
          reign of King Eadbald, and was buried with his fathers in the
          monastery and church, which we have so often mentioned, of the most

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At this time the
          nation of the Northumbrians, that is, the English tribe dwelling on
          the north side of the river Humber, with their king, Edwin,<a id="noteref_206" name="noteref_206" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_206"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">206</span></span></a>
          received the Word of faith through the preaching of Paulinus,<a id="noteref_207" name="noteref_207" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_207"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">207</span></span></a> of
          whom we have before spoken. This king, as an earnest of his
          reception of the faith, and his share in the heavenly kingdom,
          received an increase also of his temporal realm, for he reduced
          under his dominion all the parts of Britain<a id="noteref_208" name="noteref_208" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_208"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">208</span></span></a> that
          were provinces either of the English, or of the Britons, a thing
          which no English king had ever done before; and he even subjected
          to the English the Mevanian islands, as has been said above.<a id="noteref_209" name="noteref_209" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_209"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">209</span></span></a> The
          more important of these, which is to the southward, is the larger
          in extent, and more fruitful, containing nine hundred and sixty
          families, according to the English computation; the other contains
          above three hundred.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The occasion of
          this nation's reception of the faith was the alliance by marriage
          of their aforesaid king with the kings of Kent, for he had taken to
          wife Ethelberg, otherwise called Tata,<a id="noteref_210" name="noteref_210" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_210"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">210</span></span></a>
          daughter to King Ethelbert. When he first sent ambassadors to ask
          her in marriage of her brother Eadbald, who then reigned in Kent,
          he received the answer, <span class="tei tei-q">“That it was not
          lawful to give a Christian maiden in marriage to a pagan husband,
          lest the faith and the mysteries of the heavenly King should be
          profaned by her union with a king that was altogether a stranger to
          the worship of the true God.”</span> This answer being brought to
          Edwin by his messengers, he promised that he would in no manner act
          in opposition to the Christian faith, which the maiden professed;
          but would give leave to her, and all that went with her, men and
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page103">[pg 103]</span><a name="Pg103" id="Pg103" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> women, bishops and
          clergy, to follow their faith and worship after the custom of the
          Christians. Nor did he refuse to accept that religion himself, if,
          being examined by wise men, it should be found more holy and more
          worthy of God.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So the maiden
          was promised, and sent to Edwin, and in accordance with the
          agreement, Paulinus, a man beloved of God, was ordained bishop, to
          go with her, and by daily exhortations, and celebrating the
          heavenly Mysteries, to confirm her and her company, lest they
          should be corrupted by intercourse with the pagans. Paulinus was
          ordained bishop by the Archbishop Justus, on the 21st day of July,
          in the year of our Lord 625, and so came to King Edwin with the
          aforesaid maiden as an attendant on their union in the flesh. But
          his mind was wholly bent upon calling the nation to which he was
          sent to the knowledge of truth; according to the words of the
          Apostle, <span class="tei tei-q">“To espouse her to the one true
          Husband, that he might present her as a chaste virgin to
          Christ.”</span><a id="noteref_211" name="noteref_211" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_211"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">211</span></span></a> Being
          come into that province, he laboured much, not only to retain those
          that went with him, by the help of God, that they should not
          abandon the faith, but, if haply he might, to convert some of the
          pagans to the grace of the faith by his preaching. But, as the
          Apostle says, though he laboured long in the Word, <span class="tei tei-q">“The god of this world blinded the minds of them that
          believed not, lest the light of the glorious Gospel of Christ
          should shine unto them.”</span><a id="noteref_212" name="noteref_212" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_212"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">212</span></span></a></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The next year
          there came into the province one called Eumer, sent by the king of
          the West-Saxons, whose name was Cuichelm,<a id="noteref_213" name="noteref_213" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_213"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">213</span></span></a> to
          lie in wait for King Edwin, in hopes at once to deprive him of his
          kingdom and his life. He had a two-edged dagger, dipped in poison,
          to the end that, if the wound inflicted by the weapon did not avail
          to kill the king, it might be aided by the deadly venom. He came to
          the king on the first day of the Easter <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page104">[pg 104]</span><a name="Pg104" id="Pg104" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> festival,<a id="noteref_214" name="noteref_214" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_214"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">214</span></span></a> at
          the river Derwent, where there was then a royal township,<a id="noteref_215" name="noteref_215" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_215"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">215</span></span></a> and
          being admitted as if to deliver a message from his master, whilst
          unfolding in cunning words his pretended embassy, he started up on
          a sudden, and unsheathing the dagger under his garment, assaulted
          the king. When Lilla, the king's most devoted servant, saw this,
          having no buckler at hand to protect the king from death, he at
          once interposed his own body to receive the blow; but the enemy
          struck home with such force, that he wounded the king through the
          body of the slaughtered thegn. Being then attacked on all sides
          with swords, in the confusion he also slew impiously with his
          dagger another of the thegns, whose name was Forthhere.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On that same
          holy Easter night, the queen had brought forth to the king a
          daughter, called Eanfled. The king, in the presence of Bishop
          Paulinus, gave thanks to his gods for the birth of his daughter;
          and the bishop, on his part, began to give thanks to Christ, and to
          tell the king, that by his prayers to Him he had obtained that the
          queen should bring forth the child in safety, and without grievous
          pain. The king, delighted with his words, promised, that if God
          would grant him life and victory over the king by whom the murderer
          who had wounded him had been sent, he would renounce his idols, and
          serve Christ; and as a pledge that he would perform his promise, he
          delivered up that same daughter to Bishop Paulinus, to be
          consecrated to Christ. She was the first to be baptized of the
          nation of the Northumbrians, and she received Baptism on the holy
          day of Pentecost, along with eleven others of her house.<a id="noteref_216" name="noteref_216" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_216"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">216</span></span></a> At
          that time, the king, being recovered of the wound which he had
          received, raised an army and marched against <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page105">[pg 105]</span><a name="Pg105" id="Pg105" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the nation of the West-Saxons; and
          engaging in war, either slew or received in surrender all those of
          whom he learned that they had conspired to murder him. So he
          returned victorious into his own country, but he would not
          immediately and unadvisedly embrace the mysteries of the Christian
          faith, though he no longer worshipped idols, ever since he made the
          promise that he would serve Christ; but first took heed earnestly
          to be instructed at leisure by the venerable Paulinus, in the
          knowledge of faith, and to confer with such as he knew to be the
          wisest of his chief men, inquiring what they thought was fittest to
          be done in that case. And being a man of great natural sagacity, he
          often sat alone by himself a long time in silence, deliberating in
          the depths of his heart how he should proceed, and to which
          religion he should adhere.</p>

          the court of Redwald, king of the Angles,<a id="noteref_226" name="noteref_226" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_226"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">226</span></span></a> was
          of no little use in urging him to receive and understand the
          doctrines of salvation. For when Paulinus perceived that it was a
          difficult task to incline the king's proud mind to the humility of
          the way of salvation and the reception of the mystery of the
          life-giving Cross, and at the same time was employing the word of
          exhortation with men, and prayer to the Divine Goodness, for the
          salvation of Edwin and his subjects; at length, as we may suppose,
          it was shown him in spirit what the nature of the vision was that
          had been formerly revealed from Heaven to the king. Then he lost no
          time, but immediately admonished the king to perform the vow which
          he had made, when he received the vision, promising to fulfil it,
          if he should be delivered from the troubles of that time, and
          advanced to the throne.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The vision was
          this. When Ethelfrid,<a id="noteref_227" name="noteref_227" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_227"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">227</span></span></a> his
          predecessor, was persecuting him, he wandered for many years as an
          exile, hiding in divers places and kingdoms, and at last came to
          Redwald, beseeching him to give him protection against the snares
          of his powerful persecutor. Redwald willingly received him, and
          promised to perform what was asked of him. But when Ethelfrid
          understood that he had appeared in that province, and that he and
          his companions were hospitably entertained by Redwald, he sent
          messengers to bribe that king with a great sum of money to murder
          him, but without effect. He sent a second and a third time,
          offering a greater bribe each <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page113">[pg 113]</span><a name="Pg113" id="Pg113" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> time, and, moreover, threatening to make war
          on him if his offer should be despised. Redwald, whether terrified
          by his threats, or won over by his gifts, complied with this
          request, and promised either to kill Edwin, or to deliver him up to
          the envoys. A faithful friend of his, hearing of this, went into
          his chamber, where he was going to bed, for it was the first hour
          of the night; and calling him out, told him what the king had
          promised to do with him, adding, <span class="tei tei-q">“If,
          therefore, you are willing, I will this very hour conduct you out
          of this province, and lead you to a place where neither Redwald nor
          Ethelfrid shall ever find you.”</span> He answered, <span class="tei tei-q">“I thank you for your good will, yet I cannot do what
          you propose, and be guilty of being the first to break the compact
          I have made with so great a king, when he has done me no harm, nor
          shown any enmity to me; but, on the contrary, if I must die, let it
          rather be by his hand than by that of any meaner man. For whither
          shall I now fly, when I have for so many long years been a vagabond
          through all the provinces of Britain, to escape the snares of my
          enemies?”</span> His friend went away; Edwin remained alone
          without, and sitting with a heavy heart before the palace, began to
          be overwhelmed with many thoughts, not knowing what to do, or which
          way to turn.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When he had
          remained a long time in silent anguish of mind, consumed with
          inward fire,<a id="noteref_228" name="noteref_228" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_228"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">228</span></span></a> on a
          sudden in the stillness of the dead of night he saw approaching a
          person, whose face and habit were strange to him, at sight of whom,
          seeing that he was unknown and unlooked for, he was not a little
          startled. The stranger coming close up, saluted him, and asked why
          he sat there in solitude on a stone troubled and wakeful at that
          time, when all others were taking their rest, and were fast asleep.
          Edwin, in his turn, asked, what it was to him, whether he spent the
          night within doors or abroad. The stranger, in reply, said,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Do not think that I am ignorant of the
          cause of your grief, your watching, and sitting alone without. For
          I know of a surety who you <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page114">[pg 114]</span><a name="Pg114" id="Pg114" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> are, and why you grieve, and the evils which
          you fear will soon fall upon you. But tell me, what reward you
          would give the man who should deliver you out of these troubles,
          and persuade Redwald neither to do you any harm himself, nor to
          deliver you up to be murdered by your enemies.”</span> Edwin
          replied, that he would give such an one all that he could in return
          for so great a benefit. The other further added, <span class="tei tei-q">“What if he should also assure you, that your enemies
          should be destroyed, and you should be a king surpassing in power,
          not only all your own ancestors, but even all that have reigned
          before you in the English nation?”</span> Edwin, encouraged by
          these questions, did not hesitate to promise that he would make a
          fitting return to him who should confer such benefits upon him.
          Then the other spoke a third time and said, <span class="tei tei-q">“But if he who should truly foretell that all these
          great blessings are about to befall you, could also give you better
          and more profitable counsel for your life and salvation than any of
          your fathers or kindred ever heard, do you consent to submit to
          him, and to follow his wholesome guidance?”</span> Edwin at once
          promised that he would in all things follow the teaching of that
          man who should deliver him from so many great calamities, and raise
          him to a throne.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Having received
          this answer, the man who talked to him laid his right hand on his
          head saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“When this sign shall be given
          you, remember this present discourse that has passed between us,
          and do not delay the performance of what you now promise.”</span>
          Having uttered these words, he is said to have immediately
          vanished. So the king perceived that it was not a man, but a
          spirit, that had appeared to him.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whilst the royal
          youth still sat there alone, glad of the comfort he had received,
          but still troubled and earnestly pondering who he was, and whence
          he came, that had so talked to him, his aforesaid friend came to
          him, and greeting him with a glad countenance, <span class="tei tei-q">“Rise,”</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“go in;
          calm and put away your anxious cares, and compose yourself in body
          and mind to sleep; for the king's resolution is altered, and he
          designs to do you no <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page115">[pg
          115]</span><a name="Pg115" id="Pg115" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          harm, but rather to keep his pledged faith; for when he had
          privately made known to the queen his intention of doing what I
          told you before, she dissuaded him from it, reminding him that it
          was altogether unworthy of so great a king to sell his good friend
          in such distress for gold, and to sacrifice his honour, which is
          more valuable than all other adornments, for the love of
          money.”</span> In short, the king did as has been said, and not
          only refused to deliver up the banished man to his enemy's
          messengers, but helped him to recover his kingdom. For as soon as
          the messengers had returned home, he raised a mighty army to subdue
          Ethelfrid; who, meeting him with much inferior forces, (for Redwald
          had not given him time to gather and unite all his power,) was
          slain on the borders of the kingdom of Mercia, on the east side of
          the river that is called Idle.<a id="noteref_229" name="noteref_229" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_229"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">229</span></span></a> In
          this battle, Redwald's son, called Raegenheri, was killed. Thus
          Edwin, in accordance with the prophecy he had received, not only
          escaped the danger from his enemy, but, by his death, succeeded the
          king on the throne.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">King Edwin,
          therefore, delaying to receive the Word of God at the preaching of
          Paulinus, and being wont for some time, as has been said, to sit
          many hours alone, and seriously to ponder with himself what he was
          to do, and what religion he was to follow, the man of God came to
          him one day, laid his right hand on his head, and asked, whether he
          knew that sign? The king, trembling, was ready to fall down at his
          feet, but he raised him up, and speaking to him with the voice of a
          friend, said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Behold, by the gift of God
          you have escaped the hands of the enemies whom you feared. Behold,
          you have obtained of His bounty the kingdom which you desired. Take
          heed not to delay to perform your third promise; accept the faith,
          and keep the precepts of Him Who, delivering you from temporal
          adversity, has raised you to the honour of a temporal kingdom; and
          if, from this time <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page116">[pg
          116]</span><a name="Pg116" id="Pg116" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          forward, you shall be obedient to His will, which through me He
          signifies to you, He will also deliver you from the everlasting
          torments of the wicked, and make you partaker with Him of His
          eternal kingdom in heaven.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The king,
          hearing these words, answered, that he was both willing and bound
          to receive the faith which Paulinus taught; but that he would
          confer about it with his chief friends and counsellors, to the end
          that if they also were of his opinion, they might all together be
          consecrated to Christ in the font of life. Paulinus consenting, the
          king did as he said; for, holding a council with the wise
          men,<a id="noteref_230" name="noteref_230" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_230"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">230</span></span></a> he
          asked of every one in particular what he thought of this doctrine
          hitherto unknown to them, and the new worship of God that was
          preached? The chief of his own priests, Coifi, immediately answered
          him, <span class="tei tei-q">“O king, consider what this is which
          is now preached to us; for I verily declare to you what I have
          learnt beyond doubt, that the religion which we have hitherto
          professed has no virtue in it and no profit. For none of your
          people has applied himself more diligently to the worship of our
          gods than I; and yet there are many who receive greater favours
          from you, and are more preferred than I, and are more prosperous in
          all that they undertake to do or to get. Now if the gods were good
          for any thing, they would rather forward me, who have been careful
          to serve them with greater zeal. It remains, therefore, that if
          upon examination you find those new doctrines, which are now
          preached to us, better and more efficacious, we hasten to receive
          them without any delay.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another of the
          king's chief men, approving of his wise words and exhortations,
          added thereafter: <span class="tei tei-q">“The present <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page117">[pg 117]</span><a name="Pg117" id="Pg117" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> life of man upon earth, O king, seems
          to me, in comparison with that time which is unknown to us, like to
          the swift flight of a sparrow through the house wherein you sit at
          supper in winter, with your ealdormen and thegns, while the fire
          blazes in the midst, and the hall is warmed, but the wintry storms
          of rain or snow are raging abroad. The sparrow, flying in at one
          door and immediately out at another, whilst he is within, is safe
          from the wintry tempest; but after a short space of fair weather,
          he immediately vanishes out of your sight, passing from winter into
          winter again. So this life of man appears for a little while, but
          of what is to follow or what went before we know nothing at all.
          If, therefore, this new doctrine tells us something more certain,
          it seems justly to deserve to be followed.”</span> The other elders
          and king's counsellors, by Divine prompting, spoke to the same
          effect.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But Coifi added,
          that he wished more attentively to hear Paulinus discourse
          concerning the God Whom he preached. When he did so, at the king's
          command, Coifi, hearing his words, cried out, <span class="tei tei-q">“This long time I have perceived that what we
          worshipped was naught; because the more diligently I sought after
          truth in that worship, the less I found it. But now I freely
          confess, that such truth evidently appears in this preaching as can
          confer on us the gifts of life, of salvation, and of eternal
          happiness. For which reason my counsel is, O king, that we
          instantly give up to ban and fire those temples and altars which we
          have consecrated without reaping any benefit from them.”</span> In
          brief, the king openly assented to the preaching of the Gospel by
          Paulinus, and renouncing idolatry, declared that he received the
          faith of Christ: and when he inquired of the aforesaid high priest
          of his religion, who should first desecrate the altars and temples
          of their idols, with the precincts that were about them, he
          answered, <span class="tei tei-q">“I; for who can more fittingly
          than myself destroy those things which I worshipped in my folly,
          for an example to all others, through the wisdom which has been
          given me by the true God?”</span> Then immediately, in contempt of
          his vain superstitions, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page118">[pg
          118]</span><a name="Pg118" id="Pg118" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          he desired the king to furnish him with arms and a stallion, that
          he might mount and go forth to destroy the idols; for it was not
          lawful before for the high priest either to carry arms, or to ride
          on anything but a mare. Having, therefore, girt a sword about him,
          with a spear in his hand, he mounted the king's stallion, and went
          his way to the idols. The multitude, beholding it, thought that he
          was mad; but as soon as he drew near the temple he did not delay to
          desecrate it by casting into it the spear which he held; and
          rejoicing in the knowledge of the worship of the true God, he
          commanded his companions to tear down and set on fire the temple,
          with all its precincts. This place where the idols once stood is
          still shown, not far from York, to the eastward, beyond the river

          baptism. In that city also he bestowed upon his instructor and
          bishop, Paulinus, his episcopal see. But as soon as he was
          baptized, he set about building, by the direction of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page119">[pg 119]</span><a name="Pg119" id="Pg119" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Paulinus, in the same place a larger

          Having, therefore, laid the foundation, he began to build the

          initiated into the mysteries of the Christian faith in Kent, but in
          vain; for on his return home, he was seduced by his wife and
          certain perverse teachers, and turned aside from the sincerity of
          the faith; and thus his latter state was worse than the former; so
          that, like the Samaritans of old, he seemed at the same time to
          serve Christ and the gods whom he served before; and in the same
          temple he had an altar for the Christian Sacrifice, and another
          small one at which to offer victims to devils. Aldwulf,<a id="noteref_245" name="noteref_245" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_245"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">245</span></span></a> king
          of that same province, who lived in our time, testifies that this
          temple had stood until his time, and that he had seen it when he

          ignoble in his actions, being the son of Tytilus, whose father was
          Uuffa, from whom the kings of the East Angles are called
          Uuffings.<a id="noteref_246" name="noteref_246" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_246"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">246</span></span></a></p>

          of life to the aforesaid nation of the Angles. Nor were his good
          wishes in vain; for the pious labourer in the spiritual field
          reaped therein a great harvest of believers, delivering all that
          province (according to the inner signification of his name) from
          long iniquity and unhappiness, and bringing it to the faith and
          works of righteousness, and the gifts of everlasting happiness. He

          said, a woman with her new-born babe might walk throughout the
          island, from sea to sea, without receiving any harm. That king took
          such care for the good of his nation, that in several places where
          he had seen clear springs near the highways, he caused stakes to be
          fixed, with copper drinking-vessels hanging on them, for the
          refreshment of travellers; nor durst any man touch them for any
          other purpose than that for which they were designed, either
          through the great dread they had of the king, or for the affection
          which they bore him. His dignity was so great throughout his
          dominions, that not only were his banners <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page124">[pg 124]</span><a name="Pg124" id="Pg124" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> borne before him in battle, but even in time
          of peace, when he rode about his cities, townships, or provinces,
          with his thegns, the standard-bearer was always wont to go before
          him. Also, when he walked anywhere along the streets, that sort of
          banner which the Romans call Tufa,<a id="noteref_256" name="noteref_256" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_256"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">256</span></span></a> and

          ordains the same that he had before ordained in his epistle to King
          Edwin, to wit, that when either the Archbishop of Canterbury or of
          York shall depart this life, the survivor, being of the same
          degree, shall have power to ordain another bishop in the room of
          him that is departed; that it might not be necessary always to
          undertake the toilsome journey to Rome, at so great a distance by

          Pope elect, sent to them letters of great authority and erudition
          for the purpose of correcting the same error; evidently showing,
          that Easter Sunday is to be found between the fifteenth of the moon
          and the twenty-first, as was approved in the Council of
          Nicaea.<a id="noteref_265" name="noteref_265" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_265"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">265</span></span></a> He

          reject it, for he had been informed that it was again springing up
          among them. The beginning of the epistle was as follows:</p>

          writings which were brought by the bearers to Pope Severinus, of
          holy memory, were left, when he departed from the light of this
          world, without an answer to the questions contained in them. Lest
          any obscurity should long remain undispelled in a matter of so
          great moment, we opened the same, and found that some in your
          province, endeavouring to revive a new heresy out of an old one,
          contrary to the orthodox faith, do through the darkness of their
          minds reject our Easter, when Christ was sacrificed; and contend
          that the same should be kept with the Hebrews on the fourteenth of
          the moon.”</span><a id="noteref_268" name="noteref_268" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_268"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">268</span></span></a></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By this
          beginning of the epistle it evidently appears that this heresy
          arose among them in very late times, and that not all their nation,
          but only some of them, were involved in the same.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After having
          laid down the manner of keeping Easter, they add this concerning
          the Pelagians in the same epistle:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“And we have also learnt that the poison of the
          Pelagian heresy again springs up among you; we, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page130">[pg 130]</span><a name="Pg130" id="Pg130" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> therefore, exhort you, that you put
          away from your thoughts all such venomous and superstitious
          wickedness. For you cannot be ignorant how that execrable heresy
          has been condemned; for it has not only been abolished these two
          hundred years, but it is also daily condemned by us and buried
          under our perpetual ban; and we exhort you not to rake up the ashes
          of those whose weapons have been burnt. For who would not detest

          the one Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus, Who was
          conceived and born without sin; for all other men, being born in
          original sin, are known to bear the mark of Adam's transgression,

          another of them, compelled by necessity, went over to King Penda,
          and was by him afterwards slain in the reign of Oswald, contrary to
          his oath. At this time a great slaughter was made in the Church and
          nation of the Northumbrians; chiefly because one of the chiefs, by
          whom it was carried on, was a pagan, and the other a barbarian,
          more cruel than a pagan; for Penda, with all the nation of the
          Mercians, was an idolater, and a stranger to the name of Christ;
          but Caedwalla, though he professed and called himself a Christian,
          was so barbarous in his disposition and manner of living, that he
          did not even spare women and innocent children, but with bestial
          cruelty put all alike to death by torture, and overran all their
          country in his fury for a long time, intending to cut off all the
          race of the English within the borders of Britain. Nor did he pay
          any respect to the Christian religion which had sprung up among
          them; it being to this day the custom of the Britons to despise the
          faith and religion of the English, and to have no part with them in
          anything any more than with pagans. King Edwin's head was brought
          to York, and afterwards taken into the church of the blessed Peter
          the Apostle, which he had begun, but which his successor Oswald
          finished, as has been said before. It was laid in the chapel of the
          holy Pope Gregory, from whose disciples he had received the word of
          life.<a id="noteref_274" name="noteref_274" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_274"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">274</span></span></a></p>

          labours; and, dying in that Church, he left there the pall which he
          had received from the Pope of Rome. He had left behind him in his
          Church at York, James, the deacon,<a id="noteref_279" name="noteref_279" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_279"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">279</span></span></a> a
          true churchman and a holy man, who continuing long after in that
          Church, by teaching and baptizing, rescued much prey from the
          ancient enemy; and from him the village, where he chiefly dwelt,
          near Cataract,<a id="noteref_280" name="noteref_280" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_280"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">280</span></span></a> has
          its name to this day. He had great skill in singing in church, and
          when the province was afterwards restored to peace, and the number
          of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page133">[pg

          of his fathers.</p>

          slain in battle, the kingdom of the Deiri, to which province his
          family belonged, and where he first began to reign, passed to
          Osric, the son of his uncle Aelfric, who, through the preaching of
          Paulinus, had also received the mysteries of the faith. But the
          kingdom of the Bernicians—for into these two provinces the nation
          of the Northumbrians was formerly divided<a id="noteref_282" name="noteref_282" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_282"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">282</span></span></a>—passed

          derived his origin from the royal family of that province. For all
          the time that Edwin reigned, the sons of the aforesaid Ethelfrid,
          who had reigned before him, with many of the younger nobility,
          lived in banishment among the Scots or Picts, and were there
          instructed according to the doctrine of the Scots, and were renewed
          with the grace of Baptism. Upon the death of the king, their enemy,
          they were allowed to return home, and the aforesaid Eanfrid, as the
          eldest of them, became king of the Bernicians. Both those
          kings,<a id="noteref_284" name="noteref_284" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_284"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">284</span></span></a> as
          soon as they obtained the government of their earthly kingdoms,
          abjured and betrayed the mysteries of the heavenly kingdom to which
          they had been admitted, and again delivered themselves up to
          defilement and perdition through the abominations of their former
          idolatry.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But soon after,
          the king of the Britons, Caedwalla,<a id="noteref_285" name="noteref_285" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_285"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">285</span></span></a> the
          unrighteous instrument of rightful vengeance, slew them both.
          First, in the following summer, he put Osric to death; for, being
          rashly besieged by him in the municipal <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page135">[pg 135]</span><a name="Pg135" id="Pg135" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> town,<a id="noteref_286" name="noteref_286" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_286"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">286</span></span></a> he
          sallied out on a sudden with all his forces, took him by surprise,
          and destroyed him and all his army. Then, when he had occupied the
          provinces of the Northumbrians for a whole year,<a id="noteref_287" name="noteref_287" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_287"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">287</span></span></a> not
          ruling them like a victorious king, but ravaging them like a
          furious tyrant, he at length put an end to Eanfrid, in like manner,
          when he unadvisedly came to him with only twelve chosen soldiers,
          to sue for peace. To this day, that year is looked upon as
          ill-omened, and hateful to all good men; as well on account of the
          apostacy of the English kings, who had renounced the mysteries of
          the faith, as of the outrageous tyranny of the British king. Hence
          it has been generally agreed, in reckoning the dates of the kings,
          to abolish the memory of those faithless monarchs, and to assign
          that year to the reign of the following king, Oswald, a man beloved
          of God. This king, after the death of his brother Eanfrid,<a id="noteref_288" name="noteref_288" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_288"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">288</span></span></a>
          advanced with an army, small, indeed, in number, but strengthened
          with the faith of Christ; and the impious commander of the Britons,
          in spite of his vast forces, which he boasted nothing could
          withstand, was slain at a place called in the English tongue
          Denisesburna, that is, the brook of Denis.<a id="noteref_289" name="noteref_289" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_289"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">289</span></span></a></p>

          other miracles of healing wrought by the wood of the cross, which
          King Oswald, being ready to engage against the barbarians, erected,
          a certain man had his injured arm healed. [634</span> <span class="tei tei-hi" style="text-align: left"><span style="font-size: 144%; font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span><span style="font-size: 144%">]</span></h2>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The place is
          shown to this day, and held in much veneration, where Oswald, being
          about to engage in this battle, erected the symbol of the Holy
          Cross, and knelt down and prayed to God that he would send help
          from Heaven to his worshippers in their sore need. Then, we are
          told, that the cross being made in haste, and the hole dug in which
          it was to be set up, the king himself, in the ardour of his faith,
          laid hold of it and held it upright with both his hands, till the
          earth was heaped up by the soldiers and it was fixed. Thereupon,
          uplifting his voice, he cried to his whole army, <span class="tei tei-q">“Let us all kneel, and together beseech the true and
          living God Almighty in His mercy to defend us from the proud and
          cruel enemy; for He knows that we have undertaken a just war for
          the safety of our nation.”</span> All did as he had commanded, and
          accordingly advancing towards the enemy with the first dawn of day,
          they obtained the victory, as their faith deserved. In the place
          where they prayed very many miracles of healing are known to have
          been wrought, as a token and memorial of the king's faith; for even
          to this day, many are wont to cut off small splinters from the wood
          of the holy cross, and put them into water, which they give to sick
          men or cattle to drink, or they sprinkle them therewith, and these
          are presently restored to health.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The place is
          called in the English tongue Hefenfelth, or the Heavenly
          Field,<a id="noteref_290" name="noteref_290" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_290"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">290</span></span></a> which
          name it undoubtedly received <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page137">[pg 137]</span><a name="Pg137" id="Pg137" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of old as a presage of what was afterwards to
          happen, denoting, that the heavenly trophy was to be erected, the
          heavenly victory begun, and heavenly miracles shown forth to this
          day. The place is near the wall in the north which the Romans
          formerly drew across the whole of Britain from sea to sea, to
          restrain the onslaught of the barbarous nations, as has been said
          before. Hither also the brothers of the church of Hagustald,<a id="noteref_291" name="noteref_291" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_291"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">291</span></span></a> which
          is not far distant, long ago made it their custom to resort every
          year, on the day before that on which King Oswald was afterwards
          slain, to keep vigils there for the health of his soul, and having
          sung many psalms of praise, to offer for him in the morning the
          sacrifice of the Holy Oblation. And since that good custom has
          spread, they have lately built a church there, which has attached
          additional sanctity and honour in the eyes of all men to that
          place;<a id="noteref_292" name="noteref_292" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_292"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">292</span></span></a> and
          this with good reason; for it appears that there was no symbol of
          the Christian faith, no church, no altar erected throughout all the
          nation of the Bernicians, before that new leader in war, prompted
          by the zeal of his faith, set up this standard of the Cross as he
          was going to give battle to his barbarous enemy.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nor is it
          foreign to our purpose to relate one of the many miracles that have
          been wrought at this cross. One of the brothers of the same church
          of Hagulstald, whose name is Bothelm, and who is still living, a
          few years ago, walking carelessly on the ice at night, suddenly
          fell and broke his arm; he was soon tormented with a most grievous
          pain in the broken part, so that he could not lift his arm to his
          mouth for the anguish. Hearing one morning that one of the brothers
          designed to go up to the place of the holy cross, he desired him,
          on his <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page138">[pg
          138]</span><a name="Pg138" id="Pg138" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          return, to bring him a piece of that sacred wood, saying, he
          believed that with the mercy of God he might thereby be healed. The
          brother did as he was desired; and returning in the evening, when
          the brothers were sitting at table, gave him some of the old moss
          which grew on the surface of the wood. As he sat at table, having
          no place to bestow the gift which was brought him, he put it into
          his bosom; and forgetting, when he went to bed, to put it away,
          left it in his bosom. Awaking in the middle of the night, he felt
          something cold lying by his side, and putting his hand upon it to
          feel what it was, he found his arm and hand as sound as if he had
          never felt any such pain.</p>

          asking a bishop of the Scottish nation, had Aidan sent him, and
          granted him an episcopal see in the Isle of Lindisfarne.

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The same Oswald,
          as soon as he ascended the throne, being desirous that all the
          nation under his rule should be endued with the grace of the
          Christian faith, whereof he had found happy experience in
          vanquishing the barbarians, sent to the elders of the Scots,<a id="noteref_293" name="noteref_293" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_293"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">293</span></span></a> among
          whom himself and his followers, when in banishment, had received
          the sacrament of Baptism, desiring that they would send him a
          bishop, by whose instruction and ministry the English nation, which
          he governed, might learn the privileges and receive the Sacraments
          of the faith of our Lord. Nor were they slow in granting his
          request; for they sent him Bishop Aidan, a man of singular
          gentleness, piety, and moderation; having a zeal of God, but not
          fully according to knowledge; for he was wont to keep Easter Sunday
          according to the custom of his country, which we have before so
          often mentioned,<a id="noteref_294" name="noteref_294" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_294"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">294</span></span></a> from
          the fourteenth to the twentieth of the moon; the northern province
          of the Scots, and all the nation of the Picts, at <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page139">[pg 139]</span><a name="Pg139" id="Pg139" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> that time still celebrating Easter
          after that manner, and believing that in this observance they
          followed the writings of the holy and praiseworthy Father
          Anatolius.<a id="noteref_295" name="noteref_295" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_295"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">295</span></span></a>
          Whether this be true, every instructed person can easily judge. But
          the Scots which dwelt in the South of Ireland had long since, by
          the admonition of the Bishop of the Apostolic see, learned to
          observe Easter according to the canonical custom.<a id="noteref_296" name="noteref_296" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_296"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">296</span></span></a></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the arrival
          of the bishop, the king appointed him his episcopal see in the
          island of Lindisfarne,<a id="noteref_297" name="noteref_297" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_297"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">297</span></span></a> as he
          desired. Which place, as the tide ebbs and flows, is twice a day
          enclosed by the waves of the sea like an island; and again, twice,
          when the beach is left dry, becomes contiguous with the land. The
          king also humbly and willingly in all things giving ear to his
          admonitions, industriously applied himself to build up and extend
          the Church of Christ in his kingdom; wherein, when the bishop, who
          was not perfectly skilled in the English tongue, preached the
          Gospel, it was a fair sight to see the king himself interpreting
          the Word of God to his ealdormen and thegns, for he had thoroughly
          learned the language of the Scots during his long banishment. From
          that time many came daily into Britain from the country of the
          Scots, and with great devotion preached the Word to those provinces
          of the English, over which King Oswald reigned, and those among
          them that had received <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page140">[pg

          administered the grace of Baptism to the believers. Churches were
          built in divers places; the people joyfully flocked together to
          hear the Word; lands and other property were given of the king's
          bounty to found monasteries; English children, as well as their
          elders, were instructed by their Scottish teachers in study and the
          observance of monastic discipline. For most of those who came to
          preach were monks. Bishop Aidan was himself a monk, having been

          the sea, but had been long since given by the Picts, who inhabit
          those parts of Britain, to the Scottish monks, because they had
          received the faith of Christ through their preaching.</p>

          the southern parts belonging to that nation by steep and rugged
          mountains. For the southern Picts, who dwell on this side of those
          mountains, had, it is said, long before forsaken the errors of
          idolatry, and received the true faith by the preaching of Bishop
          Ninias,<a id="noteref_302" name="noteref_302" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_302"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">302</span></span></a> a
          most reverend and holy man of the British nation, who had been

          famous for a church dedicated to him (wherein Ninias himself and
          many other saints rest in the body), is now in the possession of
          the English nation. The place belongs to the province of the
          Bernicians, and is commonly called the White House,<a id="noteref_303" name="noteref_303" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_303"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">303</span></span></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Columba came
          into Britain in the ninth year of the reign of Bridius, who was the

          the powerful king of the Pictish nation, and he converted that
          nation to the faith of Christ, by his preaching and example.
          Wherefore he also received of them the gift of the aforesaid island
          whereon to found a monastery. It is not a large island, but
          contains about five families, according to the English computation;
          his successors hold it to this day; he was also buried therein,
          having died at the age of seventy-seven, about thirty-two years
          after he came into Britain to preach.<a id="noteref_305" name="noteref_305" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_305"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">305</span></span></a>
          Before he crossed over into Britain, he had built a famous
          monastery in Ireland, which, from the great number of oaks, is in
          the Scottish tongue called Dearmach—The Field of Oaks.<a id="noteref_306" name="noteref_306" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_306"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">306</span></span></a> From
          both these monasteries, many others had their beginning through his
          disciples, both in Britain and Ireland; but the island monastery
          where his body lies, has the pre-eminence among them all.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That island has
          for its ruler an abbot, who is a priest, to whose jurisdiction all
          the province, and even the bishops, contrary to the usual method,
          are bound to be subject, according to the example of their first
          teacher, who was not a bishop, but a priest and monk;<a id="noteref_307" name="noteref_307" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_307"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">307</span></span></a> of

          some records are said to be preserved by his disciples. But
          whatsoever he was himself, this we know for certain concerning him,
          that he left successors renowned for their continence, their love
          of God, and observance of monastic rules. It is true they employed
          doubtful cycles in fixing the time of the great festival, as having
          none to bring them the synodal decrees for the observance of
          Easter, by reason of their being so far away from the rest of the
          world; but they earnestly practised such works of piety and
          chastity as they could learn from the Prophets, the Gospels and the
          Apostolic writings. This manner of keeping Easter continued among
          them no little time, to wit, for the space of 150 years, till the
          year of our Lord 715.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But then the

          the English nation, who had long lived in banishment in Ireland for
          the sake of Christ, and was most learned in the Scriptures, and
          renowned for long perfection of life, came among them, corrected
          their error, and led them to observe the true and canonical day of
          Easter; which, nevertheless, they did not always keep on the
          fourteenth of the moon with the Jews, as some imagined, but on
          Sunday, although not in the proper week.<a id="noteref_309" name="noteref_309" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_309"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">309</span></span></a> For,

          on the first day of the week; but being rude and barbarous, they
          had not learned when that same first day after the Sabbath, which
          is now called the Lord's day, should come. But because they had not
          failed in the grace of fervent charity, they were accounted worthy

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From this
          island, then, and the fraternity of these monks, Aidan was sent to
          instruct the English nation in Christ, having received the dignity
          of a bishop. At that time Segeni,<a id="noteref_311" name="noteref_311" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_311"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">311</span></span></a> abbot
          and priest, presided over that monastery. Among other lessons in
          holy living, Aidan left the clergy a most salutary example of
          abstinence and continence; it was the highest commendation of his
          doctrine with all men, that he taught nothing that he did not
          practise in his life among his brethren; for he neither sought nor
          loved anything of this world, but delighted in distributing
          immediately among the poor whom he met whatsoever was given him by
          the kings or rich men of the world. He was wont to traverse both
          town and country on foot, never on horseback, unless compelled by
          some urgent necessity; to the end that, as he went, he might turn
          aside to any whomsoever he saw, whether rich or poor, and call upon
          them, if infidels, to receive the mystery of the faith, or, if they
          were believers, strengthen them in the faith, and stir them up by
          words and actions to giving of alms and the performance of good
          works.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His course of
          life was so different from the slothfulness of our times, that all
          those who bore him company, whether they were tonsured or laymen,
          had to study either reading the Scriptures, or learning psalms.
          This was the daily employment of himself and all that were with
          him, wheresoever they went; and if it happened, which was but
          seldom, that he was invited to the king's <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page145">[pg 145]</span><a name="Pg145" id="Pg145" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> table, he went with one or two clerks, and
          having taken a little food, made haste to be gone, either to read
          with his brethren or to pray. At that time, many religious men and
          women, led by his example, adopted the custom of prolonging their
          fast on Wednesdays and Fridays, till the ninth hour, throughout the
          year, except during the fifty days after Easter. Never, through
          fear or respect of persons, did he keep silence with regard to the
          sins of the rich; but was wont to correct them with a severe
          rebuke. He never gave money to the powerful men of the world, but
          only food, if he happened to entertain them; and, on the contrary,
          whatsoever gifts of money he received from the rich, he either
          distributed, as has been said, for the use of the poor, or bestowed
          in ransoming such as had been wrongfully sold for slaves. Moreover,
          he afterwards made many of those he had ransomed his disciples, and
          after having taught and instructed them, advanced them to priest's
          orders.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is said, that
          when King Oswald had asked a bishop of the Scots to administer the
          Word of faith to him and his nation, there was first sent to him
          another man of more harsh disposition,<a id="noteref_312" name="noteref_312" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_312"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">312</span></span></a> who,
          after preaching for some time to the English and meeting with no
          success, not being gladly heard by the people, returned home, and
          in an assembly of the elders reported, that he had not been able to
          do any good by his teaching to the nation to whom he had been sent,
          because they were intractable men, and of a stubborn and barbarous
          disposition. They then, it is said, held a council and seriously
          debated what was to be done, being desirous that the nation should
          obtain the salvation it demanded, but grieving that they had not
          received the preacher sent to them. Then said Aidan, who was also
          present in the council, to the priest in question, <span class="tei tei-q">“Methinks, brother, that you were more severe to your
          unlearned hearers than you ought to have been, and did not at
          first, conformably to the Apostolic rule, give them the milk of
          more easy doctrine, till, being by degrees nourished with the Word
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page146">[pg 146]</span><a name="Pg146" id="Pg146" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of God, they should
          be capable of receiving that which is more perfect and of
          performing the higher precepts of God.”</span> Having heard these
          words, all present turned their attention to him and began
          diligently to weigh what he had said, and they decided that he was
          worthy to be made a bishop, and that he was the man who ought to be
          sent to instruct the unbelieving and unlearned; since he was found
          to be endued preeminently with the grace of discretion, which is
          the mother of the virtues. So they ordained him and sent him forth
          to preach; and, as time went on, his other virtues became apparent,
          as well as that temperate discretion which had marked him at
          first.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">King Oswald,
          with the English nation which he governed, being instructed by the
          teaching of this bishop, not only learned to hope for a heavenly
          kingdom unknown to his fathers, but also obtained of the one God,
          Who made heaven and earth, a greater earthly kingdom than any of
          his ancestors. In brief, he brought under his dominion all the
          nations and provinces of Britain, which are divided into four
          languages, to wit, those of the Britons, the Picts, the Scots, and
          the English.<a id="noteref_313" name="noteref_313" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_313"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">313</span></span></a>
          Though raised to that height of regal power, wonderful to relate,
          he was always humble, kind, and generous to the poor and to
          strangers.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To give one
          instance, it is told, that when he was once sitting at dinner, on
          the holy day of Easter, with the aforesaid bishop, and a silver
          dish full of royal dainties was set before him, and they were just
          about to put forth their hands to bless the bread, the servant,
          whom he had appointed to relieve the needy, came in on a sudden,
          and told the king, that a great multitude of poor folk from all
          parts was sitting in the streets begging alms of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page147">[pg 147]</span><a name="Pg147" id="Pg147" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the king; he immediately ordered the
          meat set before him to be carried to the poor, and the dish to be
          broken in pieces and divided among them. At which sight, the bishop
          who sat by him, greatly rejoicing at such an act of piety, clasped
          his right hand and said, <span class="tei tei-q">“May this hand
          never decay.”</span> This fell out according to his prayer, for his
          hands with the arms being cut off from his body, when he was slain
          in battle, remain uncorrupted to this day, and are kept in a silver
          shrine, as revered relics, in St. Peter's church in the royal
          city,<a id="noteref_314" name="noteref_314" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_314"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">314</span></span></a> which
          has taken its name from Bebba, one of its former queens. Through
          this king's exertions the provinces of the Deiri and the
          Bernicians, which till then had been at variance, were peacefully
          united and moulded into one people. He was nephew to King Edwin
          through his sister Acha; and it was fit that so great a predecessor
          should have in his own family such an one to succeed him in his
          religion and sovereignty.</p>

          having promised in his presence that he would sow the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page148">[pg 148]</span><a name="Pg148" id="Pg148" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> seed of the holy faith in the farthest
          inland regions of the English, where no other teacher had been
          before him. Hereupon at the bidding of the Pope he received
          episcopal consecration from Asterius, bishop of Genoa;<a id="noteref_319" name="noteref_319" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_319"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">319</span></span></a> but
          on his arrival in Britain, he first came to the nation of the
          Gewissae, and finding all in that place confirmed pagans, he
          thought it better to preach the Word there, than to proceed further
          to seek for other hearers of his preaching.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now, as he was
          spreading the Gospel in the aforesaid province, it happened that
          when the king himself, having received instruction as a catechumen,
          was being baptized together with his people, Oswald, the most holy
          and victorious king of the Northumbrians, being present, received
          him as he came forth from baptism, and by an honourable alliance
          most acceptable to God, first adopted as his son, thus born again
          and dedicated to God, the man whose daughter<a id="noteref_320" name="noteref_320" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_320"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">320</span></span></a> he
          was about to receive in marriage. The two kings gave to the bishop
          the city called Dorcic,<a id="noteref_321" name="noteref_321" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_321"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">321</span></span></a> there
          to establish his episcopal see; where having built and consecrated
          churches, and by his pious labours called many to the Lord, he
          departed to the Lord, and was buried in the same city; but many
          years after, when Haedde was bishop,<a id="noteref_322" name="noteref_322" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_322"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">322</span></span></a> he
          was translated <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page149">[pg

          thence to the city of Venta,<a id="noteref_323" name="noteref_323" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_323"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">323</span></span></a> and
          laid in the church of the blessed Apostles, Peter and Paul.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the king
          died, his son Coinwalch<a id="noteref_324" name="noteref_324" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_324"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">324</span></span></a>
          succeeded him on the throne, but refused to receive the faith and
          the mysteries of the heavenly kingdom; and not long after he lost
          also the dominion of his earthly kingdom; for he put away the
          sister of Penda, king of the Mercians, whom he had married, and
          took another wife; whereupon a war ensuing, he was by him deprived
          of his kingdom, and withdrew to Anna, king of the East Angles,
          where he lived three years in banishment, and learned and received
          the true faith; for the king, with whom he lived in his banishment,
          was a good man, and happy in a good and saintly offspring, as we
          shall show hereafter.<a id="noteref_325" name="noteref_325" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_325"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">325</span></span></a></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But when
          Coinwalch was restored to his kingdom, there came into that
          province out of Ireland, a certain bishop called Agilbert,<a id="noteref_326" name="noteref_326" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_326"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">326</span></span></a> a
          native of Gaul, but who had then lived a long time in Ireland, for
          the purpose of reading the Scriptures. He attached himself to the
          king, and voluntarily undertook the ministry of preaching. The
          king, observing his learning and industry, desired him to accept an
          episcopal see there and remain as the bishop of his people.
          Agilbert complied with the request, and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page150">[pg 150]</span><a name="Pg150" id="Pg150" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> presided over that nation as their bishop for
          many years. At length the king, who understood only the language of
          the Saxons, weary of his barbarous tongue, privately brought into
          the province another bishop, speaking his own language, by name
          Wini,<a id="noteref_327" name="noteref_327" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_327"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">327</span></span></a> who
          had also been ordained in Gaul; and dividing his province into two
          dioceses, appointed this last his episcopal see in the city of
          Venta, by the Saxons called Wintancaestir.<a id="noteref_328" name="noteref_328" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_328"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">328</span></span></a>
          Agilbert, being highly offended, that the king should do this
          without consulting him, returned into Gaul, and being made bishop
          of the city of Paris, died there, being old and full of days. Not
          many years after his departure out of Britain, Wini was also
          expelled from his bishopric by the same king, and took refuge with
          Wulfhere, king of the Mercians, of whom he purchased for money the
          see of the city of London,<a id="noteref_329" name="noteref_329" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_329"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">329</span></span></a> and
          remained bishop thereof till his death. Thus the province of the
          West Saxons continued no small time without a bishop.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">During which
          time, the aforesaid king of that nation, sustaining repeatedly very
          great losses in his kingdom from his enemies, at length bethought
          himself, that as he had been before expelled from the throne for
          his unbelief, he had been restored when he acknowledged the faith
          of Christ; and he perceived that his kingdom, being deprived of a
          bishop, was justly deprived also of the Divine protection. He,
          therefore, sent messengers into Gaul to Agilbert, with humble
          apologies entreating him to return to the bishopric of his nation.
          But he excused himself, and protested that he could not go, because
          he was bound to the bishopric of his own city and diocese;
          notwithstanding, in order to give him some help in answer to his
          earnest request, he sent thither in his stead the priest
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page151">[pg 151]</span><a name="Pg151" id="Pg151" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Leutherius,<a id="noteref_330" name="noteref_330" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_330"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">330</span></span></a> his
          nephew, to be ordained as his bishop, if he thought fit, saying
          that he thought him worthy of a bishopric. The king and the people
          received him honourably, and asked Theodore, then Archbishop of
          Canterbury, to consecrate him as their bishop. He was accordingly
          consecrated in the same city, and many years diligently governed
          the whole bishopric of the West Saxons by synodical authority.</p>

          whom we are about to speak.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Many wonderful
          works and miracles of this virgin, dedicated to God, are to this
          day related by the inhabitants of that place; but for us it shall
          suffice to say something briefly of her departure out of this world
          to the heavenly kingdom. The day of her summoning drawing near, she
          began to visit in the monastery the cells of the infirm handmaidens
          of Christ, and particularly those that were of a great age, or most
          noted for their virtuous life, and humbly commending herself to
          their prayers, she let them know that her death was at hand, as she
          had learnt by revelation, which she said she had received in this
          manner. She had seen a band of men, clothed in white, come into the
          monastery, and being asked by her what they wanted, and what they
          did there, they answered, <span class="tei tei-q">“They had been
          sent thither to carry away with them the gold coin that had been
          brought thither from Kent.”</span> Towards the close of that same
          night, as morning began to dawn, leaving the darkness of this
          world, she departed to the light of heaven. Many of the brethren of
          that monastery who were in other houses, declared they had then
          plainly heard choirs of singing angels, and, as it were, the sound
          of a multitude entering the monastery. Whereupon going out
          immediately to see what it might be, they beheld a great light
          coming down from heaven, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page153">[pg
          153]</span><a name="Pg153" id="Pg153" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          which bore that holy soul, set loose from the bonds of the flesh,
          to the eternal joys of the celestial country. They also tell of
          other miracles that were wrought that night in the same monastery
          by the power of God; but as we must proceed to other matters, we
          leave them to be related by those whose concern they are. The body
          of this venerable virgin and bride of Christ was buried in the
          church of the blessed protomartyr, Stephen. It was thought fit,
          three days after, to take up the stone that covered the tomb, and
          to raise it higher in the same place, and whilst they were doing
          this, so sweet a fragrance rose from below, that it seemed to all
          the brethren and sisters there present, as if a store of balsam had
          been opened.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Her aunt also,
          Ethelberg, of whom we have spoken, preserved the glory, acceptable
          to God, of perpetual virginity, in a life of great self-denial, but
          the extent of her virtue became more conspicuous after her death.
          Whilst she was abbess, she began to build in her monastery a
          church, in honour of all the Apostles, wherein she desired that her
          body should be buried; but when that work was advanced half way,
          she was prevented by death from finishing it, and was buried in the
          place in the church which she had chosen. After her death, the
          brothers occupied themselves with other things, and this structure
          was left untouched for seven years, at the expiration whereof they
          resolved, by reason of the greatness of the work, wholly to abandon
          the building of the church, and to remove the abbess's bones thence
          to some other church that was finished and consecrated. On opening
          her tomb, they found the body as untouched by decay as it had been
          free from the corruption of carnal concupiscence, and having washed
          it again and clothed it in other garments, they removed it to the
          church of the blessed Stephen, the Martyr. And her festival is wont
          to be celebrated there with much honour on the 7th of July.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">How great his
          faith was towards God, and how remarkable his devotion, has been
          made evident by miracles even after his death; for, in the place
          where he was killed by the pagans, fighting for his country, sick
          men and cattle are frequently healed to this day. Whence it came to
          pass that many took up the very dust of the place where his body
          fell, and putting it into water, brought much relief with it to
          their friends who were sick. This custom came so much into use,
          that the earth being carried away by degrees, a hole was made as
          deep as the height of a man. Nor is it surprising that the sick
          should be healed in the place where he died; for, whilst he lived,
          he never ceased to provide for the poor and the sick, and to bestow
          alms on them, and assist them. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page155">[pg 155]</span><a name="Pg155" id="Pg155" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Many miracles are said to have been wrought
          in that place, or with the dust carried from it; but we have
          thought it sufficient to mention two, which we have heard from our
          elders.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It happened, not
          long after his death, that a man was travelling on horseback near
          that place, when his horse on a sudden fell sick, stood still, hung
          his head, and foamed at the mouth, and, at length, as his pain
          increased, he fell to the ground; the rider dismounted, and taking
          off his saddle,<a id="noteref_342" name="noteref_342" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_342"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">342</span></span></a>
          waited to see whether the beast would recover or die. At length,
          after writhing for a long time in extreme anguish, the horse
          happened in his struggles to come to the very place where the great
          king died. Immediately the pain abated, the beast ceased from his
          frantic kicking, and, after the manner of horses, as if resting
          from his weariness, he rolled from side to side, and then starting
          up, perfectly recovered, began to graze hungrily on the green
          herbage. The rider observing this, and being an intelligent man,
          concluded that there must be some wonderful sanctity in the place
          where the horse had been healed, and he marked the spot. After
          which he again mounted his horse, and went on to the inn where he
          intended to stop. On his arrival he found a girl, niece to the
          landlord, who had long been sick of the palsy; and when the members
          of the household, in his presence, lamented the girl's grievous
          calamity, he gave them an account of the place where his horse had
          been cured. In brief, she was put into a wagon and carried to the
          place and laid down there. At first she slept awhile, and when she
          awoke, found herself healed of her infirmity. Upon which she called
          for water, washed her face, arranged her hair, put a kerchief on
          her head, and returned home on foot, in good health, with those who
          had brought her.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">About the same
          time, another traveller, a Briton, as is reported, happened to pass
          by the same place, where the aforesaid battle was fought. Observing
          one particular spot of ground greener and more beautiful than any
          other part of the field, he had the wisdom to infer that the cause
          of the unusual greenness in that place must be that some person of
          greater holiness than any other in the army had been killed there.
          He therefore took along with him some of the dust of that piece of
          ground, tying it up in a linen cloth, supposing, as was indeed the
          case, that it would be of use for curing sick people, and
          proceeding on his journey, came in the evening to a certain
          village, and entered a house where the villagers were feasting at
          supper. Being received by the owners of the house, he sat down with
          them at the entertainment, hanging the cloth, with the dust which
          he had carried in it, on a post in the wall. They sat long at
          supper and drank deep. Now there was a great fire in the middle of
          the room, and it happened that the sparks flew up and caught the
          roof of the house, which being made of wattles and thatch, was
          suddenly wrapped in flames; the guests ran out in panic and
          confusion, but they were not able to save the burning house, which
          was rapidly being destroyed. Wherefore the house was burnt down,
          and only that post on which the dust hung in the linen cloth
          remained safe and untouched by the fire. When they beheld this
          miracle, they were all amazed, and inquiring into it diligently,
          learned that the dust had been taken from the place where the blood
          of King Oswald had been shed. These wonderful works being made
          known and reported abroad, many began daily to resort to that
          place, and received the blessing of health for themselves and their
          friends.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among the rest,
          I think we ought not to pass over in silence the miracles and signs
          from Heaven that were shown when King Oswald's bones were found,
          and translated into the church where they are now preserved. This
          was done by the zealous care of Osthryth, queen of the
          Mercians,<a id="noteref_343" name="noteref_343" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_343"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">343</span></span></a> the
          daughter of his brother Oswy, who reigned after him, as shall be
          said hereafter.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is a
          famous monastery in the province of Lindsey, called
          Beardaneu,<a id="noteref_344" name="noteref_344" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_344"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">344</span></span></a> which
          that queen and her husband Ethelred greatly loved and venerated,
          conferring upon it many honours. It was here that she was desirous
          to lay the revered bones of her uncle. When the wagon in which
          those bones were carried arrived towards evening at the aforesaid
          monastery, they that were in it were unwilling to admit them,
          because, though they knew him to be a holy man, yet, as he was a
          native of another province, and had obtained the sovereignty over
          them, they retained their ancient aversion to him even after his
          death. Thus it came to pass that the relics were left in the open
          air all that night, with only a large tent spread over the wagon
          which contained them. But it was revealed by a sign from Heaven
          with how much reverence they ought to be received by all the
          faithful; for all that night, a pillar of light, reaching from the
          wagon up to heaven, was visible in almost every part of the
          province of Lindsey. Hereupon, in the morning, the brethren of that
          monastery who had refused it the day before, began themselves
          earnestly to pray that those holy relics, beloved of God, might be
          laid among them. Accordingly, the bones, being washed, were put
          into a shrine which they had made for that purpose, and placed
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page158">[pg 158]</span><a name="Pg158" id="Pg158" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> in the church, with
          due honour; and that there might be a perpetual memorial of the
          royal character of this holy man, they hung up over the monument
          his banner of gold and purple. Then they poured out the water in
          which they had washed the bones, in a corner of the cemetery.<a id="noteref_345" name="noteref_345" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_345"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">345</span></span></a> From
          that time, the very earth which received that holy water, had the
          power of saving grace in casting out devils from the bodies of
          persons possessed.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Lastly, when the
          aforesaid queen afterwards abode some time in that monastery, there
          came to visit her a certain venerable abbess, who is still living,
          called Ethelhild, the sister of the holy men, Ethelwin<a id="noteref_346" name="noteref_346" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_346"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">346</span></span></a> and
          Aldwin, the first of whom was bishop in the province of Lindsey,
          the other abbot of the monastery of Peartaneu;<a id="noteref_347" name="noteref_347" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_347"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">347</span></span></a> not
          far from which was the monastery of Ethelhild. When this lady was
          come, in a conversation between her and the queen, the discourse,
          among other things, turning upon Oswald, she said, that she also
          had that night seen the light over his relics reaching up to
          heaven. The queen thereupon added, that the very dust of the
          pavement on which the water that washed the bones had been poured
          out, had already healed many sick persons. The abbess thereupon
          desired that some of that health-bringing dust might be given her,
          and, receiving it, she tied it up in a cloth, and, putting it into
          a casket, returned home. Some time after, when she was in her
          monastery, there came to it a guest, who was wont often in the
          night to be on a sudden grievously tormented with an unclean
          spirit; he being hospitably entertained, when he had gone to bed
          after supper, was suddenly seized by the Devil, and began to cry
          out, to gnash his teeth, to foam at the mouth, and to writhe and
          distort his limbs. None being able to hold or bind him, the servant
          ran, and knocking at the door, told <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page159">[pg 159]</span><a name="Pg159" id="Pg159" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the abbess. She, opening the monastery door,
          went out herself with one of the nuns to the men's apartment, and
          calling a priest, desired that he would go with her to the
          sufferer. Being come thither, and seeing many present, who had not
          been able, by their efforts, to hold the tormented person and
          restrain his convulsive movements, the priest used exorcisms, and
          did all that he could to assuage the madness of the unfortunate
          man, but, though he took much pains, he could not prevail. When no
          hope appeared of easing him in his ravings, the abbess bethought
          herself of the dust, and immediately bade her handmaiden go and
          fetch her the casket in which it was. As soon as she came with it,
          as she had been bidden, and was entering the hall of the house, in
          the inner part whereof the possessed person was writhing in
          torment, he suddenly became silent, and laid down his head, as if
          he had been falling asleep, stretching out all his limbs to rest.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Silence fell upon all and intent they
          gazed,”</span><a id="noteref_348" name="noteref_348" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_348"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">348</span></span></a>
          anxiously waiting to see the end of the matter. And after about the
          space of an hour the man that had been tormented sat up, and
          fetching a deep sigh, said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Now I am
          whole, for I am restored to my senses.”</span> They earnestly
          inquired how that came to pass, and he answered, <span class="tei tei-q">“As soon as that maiden drew near the hall of this
          house, with the casket she brought, all the evil spirits that vexed
          me departed and left me, and were no more to be seen.”</span> Then
          the abbess gave him a little of that dust, and the priest having
          prayed, he passed that night in great peace; nor was he, from that
          time forward, alarmed by night, or in any way troubled by his old
          enemy.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Some time after,
          there was a certain little boy in the said monastery, who had been
          long grievously troubled with <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page160">[pg 160]</span><a name="Pg160" id="Pg160" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> a fever; he was one day anxiously expecting
          the hour when his fit was to come on, when one of the brothers,
          coming in to him, said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Shall I tell you,
          my son, how you may be cured of this sickness? Rise, enter the
          church, and go close to Oswald's tomb; sit down and stay there
          quiet and do not leave it; do not come away, or stir from the
          place, till the time is past, when the fever leaves you: then I
          will go in and fetch you away.”</span> The boy did as he was
          advised, and the disease durst not assail him as he sat by the
          saint's tomb; but fled in such fear that it did not dare to touch
          him, either the second or third day, or ever after. The brother
          that came from thence, and told me this, added, that at the time
          when he was talking with me, the young man was then still living in
          the monastery, on whom, when a boy, that miracle of healing had
          been wrought. Nor need we wonder that the prayers of that king who
          is now reigning with our Lord, should be very efficacious with Him,
          since he, whilst yet governing his temporal kingdom, was always
          wont to pray and labour more for that which is eternal. Nay, it is
          said, that he often continued in prayer from the hour of morning
          thanksgiving<a id="noteref_349" name="noteref_349" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_349"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">349</span></span></a> till
          it was day; and that by reason of his constant custom of praying or
          giving thanks to God, he was wont always, wherever he sat, to hold
          his hands on his knees with the palms turned upwards. It is also
          commonly affirmed and has passed into a proverb, that he ended his
          life in prayer; for when he was beset with the weapons of his
          enemies, and perceived that death was at hand, he prayed for the
          souls of his army. Whence it is proverbially said, <span class="tei tei-q">“ <span class="tei tei-q">‘Lord have mercy on their

          holy archbishop of the Frisians, he often heard him tell of the
          wonders which had been wrought in that province at the relics of
          that most worshipful king. And he used to say that in Ireland,
          when, being yet only a priest, he led the life of a stranger and
          pilgrim for love of the eternal country, the fame of that king's
          sanctity was already spread far and near in that island also. One
          of the miracles, among the rest, which he related, we have thought
          fit to insert in this our history.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page162">[pg 162]</span><a name="Pg162" id="Pg162" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“At the time,”</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“of the plague which made such widespread havoc in
          Britain and Ireland, among others, a certain scholar of the
          Scottish race was smitten with the disease, a man learned in the
          study of letters, but in no way careful or studious of his eternal
          salvation; who, seeing his death near at hand, began to fear and
          tremble lest, as soon as he was dead, he should be hurried away to
          the prison-house of Hell for his sins. He called me, for I was
          near, and trembling and sighing in his weakness, with a lamentable
          voice made his complaint to me, after this manner: <span class="tei tei-q">‘You see that my bodily distress increases, and that I
          am now reduced to the point of death. Nor do I question but that
          after the death of my body, I shall be immediately snatched away to
          the everlasting death of my soul, and cast into the torments of
          hell, since for a long time, amidst all my reading of divine books,
          I have suffered myself to be ensnared by sin, instead of keeping
          the commandments of God. But it is my resolve, if the Divine Mercy
          shall grant me a new term of life, to correct my sinful habits, and
          wholly to devote anew my mind and life to obedience to the Divine
          will. But I know that I have no merits of my own whereby to obtain
          a prolongation of life, nor can I hope to have it, unless it shall
          please God to forgive me, wretched and unworthy of pardon as I am,
          through the help of those who have faithfully served him. We have
          heard, and the report is widespread, that there was in your nation
          a king, of wonderful sanctity, called Oswald, the excellency of
          whose faith and virtue has been made famous even after his death by
          the working of many miracles. I beseech you, if you have any relics
          of his in your keeping, that you will bring them to me; if haply
          the Lord shall be pleased, through his merits, to have mercy on
          me.’</span> I answered, <span class="tei tei-q">‘I have indeed a
          part of the stake on which his head was set up by the pagans, when
          he was killed, and if you believe with steadfast heart, the Divine
          mercy may, through the merits of so great a man, both grant you a
          longer term of life here, and render you worthy to be admitted into
          eternal life.’</span> He answered immediately <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page163">[pg 163]</span><a name="Pg163" id="Pg163" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> that he had entire faith therein. Then
          I blessed some water, and put into it a splinter of the aforesaid
          oak, and gave it to the sick man to drink. He presently found ease,
          and, recovering of his sickness, lived a long time after; and,
          being entirely converted to God in heart and deed, wherever he
          went, he spoke of the goodness of his merciful Creator, and the
          honour of His faithful servant.”</span></p>

          first part of his reign, had a partner in the royal dignity called
          Oswin, of the race of King Edwin, and son to Osric<a id="noteref_360" name="noteref_360" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_360"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">360</span></span></a> of
          whom we have spoken above, a man of wonderful piety and devotion,
          who governed the province of the Deiri seven years in very great
          prosperity, and was himself beloved by all men. But Oswy, who
          governed all the other northern part of the nation beyond the
          Humber, that is, the province of the Bernicians, could not live at
          peace with him; and at last, when the causes of their disagreement
          increased, he murdered him most cruelly. For when each had raised
          an army against the other, Oswin perceived that he could not
          maintain a war against his enemy who had more auxiliaries than
          himself, and he thought it better at that time to lay aside all
          thoughts of engaging, and to reserve himself for better times. He
          therefore disbanded the army which he had assembled, and ordered
          all his men to return to their own homes, from the place that is
          called Wilfaraesdun,<a id="noteref_361" name="noteref_361" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_361"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">361</span></span></a> that
          is, Wilfar's Hill, which is about ten miles distant from the
          village called Cataract, towards the north-west. He himself, with
          only one trusty thegn, whose name was Tondhere, withdrew and lay
          concealed in the house of Hunwald, a noble,<a id="noteref_362" name="noteref_362" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_362"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">362</span></span></a> whom
          he imagined to be his most assured friend. But, alas! it was far
          otherwise; for Hunwald betrayed him, and Oswy, by the hands of his
          reeve, Ethilwin, foully slew him and the thegn aforesaid. This
          happened on the 20th of August, in the ninth year of his reign, at
          a place called Ingetlingum, where afterwards, to atone for this
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page165">[pg 165]</span><a name="Pg165" id="Pg165" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> crime, a monastery
          was built,<a id="noteref_363" name="noteref_363" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_363"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">363</span></span></a>
          wherein prayers should be daily offered up to God for the
          redemption of the souls of both kings, to wit, of him that was
          murdered, and of him that commanded the murder.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">King Oswin was
          of a goodly countenance, and tall of stature, pleasant in
          discourse, and courteous in behaviour; and bountiful to all, gentle
          and simple alike; so that he was beloved by all men for the royal
          dignity of his mind and appearance and actions, and men of the
          highest rank came from almost all provinces to serve him. Among all
          the graces of virtue and moderation by which he was distinguished
          and, if I may say so, blessed in a special manner, humility is said
          to have been the greatest, which it will suffice to prove by one
          instance.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He had given a
          beautiful horse to Bishop Aidan, to use either in crossing rivers,
          or in performing a journey upon any urgent necessity, though the
          Bishop was wont to travel ordinarily on foot. Some short time
          after, a poor man meeting the Bishop, and asking alms, he
          immediately dismounted, and ordered the horse, with all his royal
          trappings, to be given to the beggar; for he was very
          compassionate, a great friend to the poor, and, in a manner, the
          father of the wretched. This being told to the king, when they were
          going in to dinner, he said to the Bishop, <span class="tei tei-q">“What did you mean, my lord Bishop, by giving the poor
          man that royal horse, which it was fitting that you should have for
          your own use? Had not we many other horses of less value, or things
          of other sorts, which would have been good enough to give to the
          poor, instead of giving that horse, which I had chosen and set
          apart for your own use?”</span> Thereupon the Bishop answered,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“What do you say, O king? Is that son of a
          mare more dear to you than that son of God?”</span> Upon this they
          went in to dinner, and the Bishop sat in his place; but the king,
          who had come in from hunting, stood warming himself, with his
          attendants, at the fire. Then, on a sudden, whilst he was warming
          himself, calling <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page166">[pg
          166]</span><a name="Pg166" id="Pg166" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          to mind what the bishop had said to him, he ungirt his sword, and
          gave it to a servant, and hastened to the Bishop and fell down at
          his feet, beseeching him to forgive him; <span class="tei tei-q">“For from this time forward,”</span> said he,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“I will never speak any more of this, nor
          will I judge of what or how much of our money you shall give to the
          sons of God.”</span> The bishop was much moved at this sight, and
          starting up, raised him, saying that he was entirely reconciled to
          him, if he would but sit down to his meat, and lay aside all
          sorrow. The king, at the bishop's command and request, was
          comforted, but the bishop, on the other hand, grew sad and was
          moved even to tears. His priest then asking him, in the language of
          his country, which the king and his servants did not understand,
          why he wept, <span class="tei tei-q">“I know,”</span> said he,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“that the king will not live long; for I
          never before saw a humble king; whence I perceive that he will soon
          be snatched out of this life, because this nation is not worthy of
          such a ruler.”</span> Not long after, the bishop's gloomy
          foreboding was fulfilled by the king's sad death, as has been said
          above. But Bishop Aidan himself was also taken out of this world,
          not more than twelve days after the death of the king he loved, on
          the 31st of August,<a id="noteref_364" name="noteref_364" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_364"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">364</span></span></a> to

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">How great the
          merits of Aidan were, was made manifest by the Judge of the heart,
          with the testimony of miracles, whereof it will suffice to mention
          three, that they may not be forgotten. A certain priest, whose name
          was Utta,<a id="noteref_365" name="noteref_365" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_365"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">365</span></span></a> a man
          of great weight and sincerity, and on that account honoured by all

          King Oswy, Eanfled,<a id="noteref_366" name="noteref_366" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_366"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">366</span></span></a> the
          daughter of King Edwin, who had been carried thither when her
          father was killed. Intending to go thither by land, but to return
          with the maiden by sea, he went to Bishop Aidan, and entreated him
          to offer up his prayers to the Lord for him and his company, who
          were then to set out on so long a journey. He, blessing them, and
          commending them to the Lord, at the same time gave them some holy
          oil, saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“I know that when you go on
          board ship, you will meet with a storm and contrary wind; but be
          mindful to cast this oil I give you into the sea, and the wind will
          cease immediately; you will have pleasant calm weather to attend
          you and send you home by the way that you desire.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All these things
          fell out in order, even as the bishop had foretold. For first, the
          waves of the sea raged, and the sailors endeavoured to ride it out
          at anchor, but all to no purpose; for the sea sweeping over the
          ship on all sides and beginning to fill it with water, they all
          perceived that death was at hand and about to overtake them. The
          priest at last, remembering the bishop's words, laid hold of the
          phial and cast some of the oil into the sea, which at once, as had
          been foretold, ceased from its uproar. Thus it came to pass that
          the man of God, by the spirit of prophecy, foretold the storm that
          was to come to pass, and by virtue of the same spirit, though
          absent in the body, calmed it when it had arisen. The story of this
          miracle was not told me by a person of little credit, but by
          Cynimund, a most faithful priest of our church,<a id="noteref_367" name="noteref_367" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_367"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">367</span></span></a> who

          has its name from Bebba, formerly its queen. Not being able to take
          it by storm or by siege, he endeavoured to burn it down; and having
          pulled down all the villages in the neighbourhood of the city, he
          brought thither an immense quantity of beams, rafters, partitions,
          wattles and thatch, wherewith he encompassed the place to a great
          height on the land side, and when he found the wind favourable, he
          set fire to it and attempted to burn the town.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At that time,
          the most reverend Bishop Aidan was dwelling in the Isle of
          Farne,<a id="noteref_369" name="noteref_369" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_369"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">369</span></span></a> which
          is about two miles from the city; for thither he was wont often to
          retire to pray in solitude and silence; and, indeed, this lonely
          dwelling of his is to this day shown in that island. When he saw
          the flames of fire and the smoke carried by the wind rising above
          the city walls, he is said to have lifted up his eyes and hands to
          heaven, and cried with tears, <span class="tei tei-q">“Behold,
          Lord, how great evil is wrought by Penda!”</span> These words were
          hardly uttered, when the wind immediately veering from the city,
          drove back the flames upon those who had kindled them, so that some
          being hurt, and all afraid, they forebore any further attempts
          against the city, which they perceived to be protected by the hand
          of God.</p>

          above, at the time when death caused him to quit the body, after he
          had been bishop sixteen<a id="noteref_370" name="noteref_370" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_370"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">370</span></span></a>
          years; for having a church and a chamber in that place, he was wont
          often to go and stay there, and to make excursions from it to
          preach in the country round about, which he likewise did at other
          of the king's townships, having nothing of his own besides his
          church and a few fields about it. When he was sick they set up a
          tent for him against the wall at the west end of the church, and so
          it happened that he breathed his last, leaning against a buttress
          that was on the outside of the church to strengthen the wall. He
          died in the seventeenth year of his episcopate, on the 31st of
          August.<a id="noteref_371" name="noteref_371" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_371"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">371</span></span></a> His
          body was thence presently translated to the isle of Lindisfarne,
          and buried in the cemetery of the brethren. Some time after, when a
          larger church was built there and dedicated in honour of the
          blessed prince of the Apostles, his bones were translated thither,
          and laid on the right side of the altar, with the respect due to so
          great a prelate.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Finan,<a id="noteref_372" name="noteref_372" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_372"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">372</span></span></a> who
          had likewise been sent thither from Hii, the island monastery of
          the Scots, succeeded him, and continued no small time in the
          bishopric. It happened some years after, that Penda, king of the
          Mercians, coming into these parts with a hostile army, destroyed
          all he could with fire and sword, and the village where the bishop
          died, along with the church above <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page170">[pg 170]</span><a name="Pg170" id="Pg170" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> mentioned, was burnt down; but it fell out in
          a wonderful manner that the buttress against which he had been
          leaning when he died, could not be consumed by the fire which
          devoured all about it. This miracle being noised abroad, the church
          was soon rebuilt in the same place, and that same buttress was set
          up on the outside, as it had been before, to strengthen the wall.
          It happened again, some time after, that the village and likewise
          the church were carelessly burned down the second time. Then again,
          the fire could not touch the buttress; and, miraculously, though
          the fire broke through the very holes of the nails wherewith it was
          fixed to the building, yet it could do no hurt to the buttress
          itself. When therefore the church was built there the third time,
          they did not, as before, place that buttress on the outside as a
          support of the building, but within the church, as a memorial of
          the miracle; where the people coming in might kneel, and implore
          the Divine mercy. And it is well known that since then many have
          found grace and been healed in that same place, as also that by
          means of splinters cut off from the buttress, and put into water,
          many more have obtained a remedy for their own infirmities and
          those of their friends.<a id="noteref_373" name="noteref_373" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_373"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">373</span></span></a></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I have written
          thus much concerning the character and works of the aforesaid
          Aidan, in no way commending or approving his lack of wisdom with
          regard to the observance of Easter; nay, heartily detesting it, as
          I have most manifestly proved in the book I have written,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“De Temporibus”</span>;<a id="noteref_374" name="noteref_374" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_374"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">374</span></span></a> but,
          like an impartial historian, unreservedly relating what was done by
          or through him, and commending such things as are praiseworthy in
          his actions, and preserving the memory thereof for the benefit of
          the readers; to wit, his love of peace and charity; of continence
          and humility; his mind superior to anger and avarice, and despising
          pride and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page171">[pg
          171]</span><a name="Pg171" id="Pg171" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          vainglory; his industry in keeping and teaching the Divine
          commandments, his power of study and keeping vigil; his priestly
          authority in reproving the haughty and powerful, and at the same
          time his tenderness in comforting the afflicted, and relieving or
          defending the poor. To be brief, so far as I have learnt from those
          that knew him, he took care to neglect none of those things which
          he found in the Gospels and the writings of Apostles and prophets,
          but to the utmost of his power endeavoured to fulfil them all in
          his deeds.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These things I
          greatly admire and love in the aforesaid bishop, because I do not
          doubt that they were pleasing to God; but I do not approve or
          praise his observance of Easter at the wrong time, either through
          ignorance of the canonical time appointed, or, if he knew it, being
          prevailed on by the authority of his nation not to adopt it.<a id="noteref_375" name="noteref_375" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_375"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">375</span></span></a> Yet
          this I approve in him, that in the celebration of his Easter, the
          object which he had at heart and reverenced and preached was the
          same as ours, to wit, the redemption of mankind, through the
          Passion, Resurrection and Ascension into Heaven of the Man Christ
          Jesus, who is the mediator between God and man. And therefore he
          always celebrated Easter, not as some falsely imagine, on the
          fourteenth of the moon, like the Jews, on any day of the week, but
          on the Lord's day, from the fourteenth to the twentieth of the
          moon; and this he did from his belief that the Resurrection of our
          Lord happened on the first day of the week, and for the hope of our
          resurrection, which also he, with the holy Church, believed would
          truly happen on that same first day of the week, now called the
          Lord's day.</p>

          so great a lover of the heavenly kingdom, that at last, quitting
          the affairs of his kingdom, and committing them to his kinsman
          Ecgric, who before had a share in that kingdom, he entered a
          monastery, which he had built for himself, and having received the
          tonsure, applied himself rather to do battle for a heavenly throne.
          A long time after this, it happened that the nation of the
          Mercians, under King Penda, made war on the East Angles; who
          finding themselves no match for their enemy, entreated Sigbert to
          go with them to battle, to encourage the soldiers. He was unwilling
          and refused, upon which they drew him against his will out of the
          monastery, and carried him to the army, hoping that the soldiers
          would be less afraid and less disposed to flee in the presence of
          one who had formerly been an active and distinguished commander.
          But he, still mindful of his profession, surrounded, as he was, by
          a royal army, would carry nothing in his hand but a wand, and was
          killed with King Ecgric; and the pagans pressing on, all their army
          was either slaughtered or dispersed.</p>

          called Fursa,<a id="noteref_379" name="noteref_379" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_379"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">379</span></span></a>
          renowned both for his words and actions, and remarkable for
          singular virtues, being desirous to live as a stranger and pilgrim
          for the Lord's sake, wherever an opportunity should offer. On
          coming into the province of the East Angles, he was honourably
          received by the aforesaid king, and performing his wonted task of
          preaching the Gospel, by the example of his virtue and the
          influence of his words, converted many unbelievers to Christ, and
          confirmed in the faith and love of Christ those that already
          believed.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Here he fell
          into some infirmity of body, and was thought worthy to see a vision
          of angels; in which he was admonished diligently to persevere in
          the ministry of the Word which he had undertaken, and indefatigably
          to apply himself to his usual watching and prayers; inasmuch as his
          end was certain, but the hour thereof uncertain, according to the
          saying of our Lord, <span class="tei tei-q">“Watch therefore, for
          ye know neither the day nor the hour.”</span><a id="noteref_380" name="noteref_380" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_380"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">380</span></span></a> Being
          confirmed by this vision, he set himself with all speed to build a
          monastery on the ground which had been given him by King Sigbert,
          and to establish a rule <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page174">[pg

          of life therein. This monastery was pleasantly situated in the
          woods, near the sea; it was built within the area of a fort, which
          in the English language is called Cnobheresburg, that is,
          Cnobhere's Town;<a id="noteref_381" name="noteref_381" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_381"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">381</span></span></a>
          afterwards, Anna, king of that province, and certain of the nobles,
          embellished it with more stately buildings and with gifts.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This man was of
          noble Scottish<a id="noteref_382" name="noteref_382" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_382"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">382</span></span></a>
          blood, but much more noble in mind than in birth. From his boyish
          years, he had earnestly applied himself to reading sacred books and
          observing monastic discipline, and, as is most fitting for holy
          men, he carefully practised all that he learned to be right.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now, in course
          of time he himself built a monastery,<a id="noteref_383" name="noteref_383" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_383"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">383</span></span></a>
          wherein he might with more freedom devote himself to his heavenly
          studies. There, falling sick, as the book concerning his life
          clearly informs us, he fell into a trance, and quitting his body
          from the evening till cockcrow, he was accounted worthy to behold
          the sight of the choirs of angels, and to hear their glad songs of
          praise. He was wont to declare, that among other things he
          distinctly heard this refrain: <span class="tei tei-q">“The saints
          shall go from strength to strength.”</span><a id="noteref_384" name="noteref_384" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_384"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">384</span></span></a> And

          restored to his body, and again taken from it three days after, he
          not only saw the greater joys of the blessed, but also fierce
          conflicts of evil spirits, who by frequent accusations wickedly
          endeavoured to obstruct his journey to heaven; but the angels
          protected him, and all their endeavours were in vain. Concerning
          all these matters, if any one desires to be more fully informed, to
          wit, with what subtlety of deceit the devils recounted both his
          actions and idle words, and even his thoughts, as if they had been
          written down in a book; <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page175">[pg
          175]</span><a name="Pg175" id="Pg175" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          and what joyous or grievous tidings he learned from the holy angels
          and just men who appeared to him among the angels; let him read the
          little book of his life which I have mentioned, and I doubt not
          that he will thereby reap much spiritual profit.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But there is one
          thing among the rest, which we have thought it may be beneficial to
          many to insert in this history. When he had been taken up on high,
          he was bidden by the angels that conducted him to look back upon
          the world. Upon which, casting his eyes downward, he saw, as it
          were, a dark valley in the depths underneath him. He also saw four
          fires in the air, not far distant from each other. Then asking the
          angels, what fires those were, he was told, they were the fires
          which would kindle and consume the world. One of them was of
          falsehood, when we do not fulfil that which we promised in Baptism,
          to renounce the Devil and all his works. The next was of
          covetousness, when we prefer the riches of the world to the love of
          heavenly things. The third was of discord, when we do not fear to
          offend our neighbour even in needless things. The fourth was of
          ruthlessness when we think it a light thing to rob and to defraud
          the weak. These fires, increasing by degrees, extended so as to
          meet one another, and united in one immense flame. When it drew
          near, fearing for himself, he said to the angel, <span class="tei tei-q">“Lord, behold the fire draws near to me.”</span> The
          angel answered, <span class="tei tei-q">“That which you did not
          kindle will not burn you; for though this appears to be a terrible
          and great pyre, yet it tries every man according to the merits of
          his works; for every man's concupiscence shall burn in this fire;
          for as a man burns in the body through unlawful pleasure, so, when
          set free from the body, he shall burn by the punishment which he
          has deserved.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then he saw one
          of the three angels, who had been his guides throughout both
          visions, go before and divide the flaming fires, whilst the other
          two, flying about on both sides, defended him from the danger of
          the fire. He also saw devils flying through the fire, raising the
          flames of war against the just. Then followed <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page176">[pg 176]</span><a name="Pg176" id="Pg176" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> accusations of the envious spirits
          against himself, the defence of the good spirits, and a fuller
          vision of the heavenly hosts; as also of holy men of his own
          nation, who, as he had learnt, had worthily held the office of
          priesthood in old times, and who were known to fame; from whom he
          heard many things very salutary to himself, and to all others that
          would listen to them. When they had ended their discourse, and
          returned to Heaven with the angelic spirits, there remained with
          the blessed Fursa, the three angels of whom we have spoken before,
          and who were to bring him back to the body. And when they
          approached the aforesaid great fire, the angel divided the flame,
          as he had done before; but when the man of God came to the passage
          so opened amidst the flames, the unclean spirits, laying hold of
          one of those whom they were burning in the fire, cast him against
          him, and, touching his shoulder and jaw, scorched them. He knew the
          man, and called to mind that he had received his garment when he
          died. The holy angel, immediately laying hold of the man, threw him
          back into the fire, and the malignant enemy said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Do not reject him whom you before received; for as you
          received the goods of the sinner, so you ought to share in his
          punishment.”</span> But the angel withstood him, saying,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“He did not receive them through avarice,
          but in order to save his soul.”</span> The fire ceased, and the
          angel, turning to him, said, <span class="tei tei-q">“That which
          you kindled burned you; for if you had not received the money of
          this man that died in his sins, his punishment would not burn
          you.”</span> And he went on to speak with wholesome counsel of what
          ought to be done for the salvation of such as repented in the hour
          of death.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Being afterwards
          restored to the body, throughout the whole course of his life he
          bore the mark of the fire which he had felt in the spirit, visible
          to all men on his shoulder and jaw; and the flesh openly showed, in
          a wonderful manner, what the spirit had suffered in secret. He
          always took care, as he had done before, to teach all men the
          practice of virtue, as well by his example, as by preaching. But as
          for the story of his visions, he <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page177">[pg 177]</span><a name="Pg177" id="Pg177" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> would only relate them to those who, from
          desire of repentance, questioned him about them. An aged brother of
          our monastery is still living, who is wont to relate that a very
          truthful and religious man told him, that he had seen Fursa himself
          in the province of the East Angles, and heard those visions from
          his lips; adding, that though it was in severe winter weather and a
          hard frost, and the man was sitting in a thin garment when he told
          the story, yet he sweated as if it had been in the heat of
          mid-summer, by reason of the great terror or joy of which he
          spoke.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To return to
          what we were saying before, when, after preaching the Word of God
          many years in Scotland,<a id="noteref_386" name="noteref_386" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_386"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">386</span></span></a> he
          could not well endure the disturbance of the crowds that resorted
          to him, leaving all that he looked upon as his own, he departed
          from his native island, and came with a few brothers through the
          Britons into the province of the English, and preaching the Word
          there, as has been said, built a famous monastery.<a id="noteref_387" name="noteref_387" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_387"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">387</span></span></a> When
          this was duly carried out, he became desirous to rid himself of all
          business of this world, and even of the monastery itself, and
          forthwith left the care of it and of its souls, to his brother
          Fullan, and the priests Gobban and Dicull,<a id="noteref_388" name="noteref_388" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_388"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">388</span></span></a> and
          being himself free from all worldly affairs, resolved to end his
          life as a hermit. He had another brother called Ultan, who, after a
          long monastic probation, had also adopted the life of an anchorite.
          So, seeking him out alone, he lived a whole year with him in
          self-denial and prayer, and laboured daily with his hands.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Afterwards
          seeing the province thrown into confusion by the irruptions of the
          pagans,<a id="noteref_389" name="noteref_389" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_389"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">389</span></span></a> and
          foreseeing that the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page178">[pg
          178]</span><a name="Pg178" id="Pg178" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          monasteries would also be in danger, he left all things in order,
          and sailed over into Gaul, and being there honourably entertained
          by Clovis, king of the Franks,<a id="noteref_390" name="noteref_390" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_390"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">390</span></span></a> or by
          the patrician Ercinwald, he built a monastery in the place called
          Latineacum,<a id="noteref_391" name="noteref_391" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_391"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">391</span></span></a> and
          falling sick not long after, departed this life. The same
          Ercinwald, the patrician, took his body, and kept it in the porch
          of a church he was building in his town of Perrona,<a id="noteref_392" name="noteref_392" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_392"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">392</span></span></a> till
          the church itself should be dedicated. This happened twenty-seven
          days after, and the body being taken from the porch, to be
          re-buried near the altar, was found as whole as if he had died that
          very hour. And again, four years after, when a more beautiful
          shrine had been built to receive his body to the east of the altar,
          it was still found without taint of corruption, and was translated
          thither with due honour; where it is well known that his merits,
          through the divine operation, have been declared by many miracles.
          We have briefly touched upon these matters as well as the
          incorruption of his body, that the lofty nature of the man may be
          better known to our readers. All which, as also concerning the
          comrades of his warfare, whosoever will read it, will find more
          fully described in the book of his life.</p>

          reigned next to Sigbert surnamed The Little, was then king of that
          nation, and a friend to King Oswy, who, when Sigbert came to the
          province of the Northumbrians to visit him, as he often did, used
          to endeavour to convince him that those could not be gods that had
          been made by the hands of men; that a stock or a stone could not be
          proper matter to form a god, the residue whereof was either burned
          in the fire, or framed into any vessels for the use of men, or else
          was cast out as refuse, trampled on and turned into dust. That God
          is rather to be understood as incomprehensible in majesty and
          invisible to human eyes, almighty, eternal, the Creator of heaven
          and earth and of mankind; Who governs and will judge the world in
          righteousness, Whose eternal abode must be believed to be in
          Heaven, and not in base and perishable metal; and that it ought in
          reason to be concluded, that all those who learn and do the will of
          Him by Whom they were created, will receive from Him eternal
          rewards. King Oswy having often, with friendly counsel, like a
          brother, said this and much more to the like effect to King
          Sigbert, at length, aided by the consent of his friends, he
          believed, and after he had consulted with those about him, and
          exhorted them, when they all agreed and assented to the faith, he
          was baptized with them by Bishop Finan, in the king's township
          above spoken of, which is called At the Wall,<a id="noteref_415" name="noteref_415" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_415"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">415</span></span></a>

          the island of Britain, at the distance of twelve miles from the
          eastern sea.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">King Sigbert,
          having now become a citizen of the eternal kingdom, returned to the
          seat of his temporal kingdom, requesting of King Oswy that he would
          give him some teachers, to convert his nation to the faith of
          Christ, and cleanse them in the fountain of salvation. Wherefore
          Oswy, sending into the province of the Midland Angles, summoned the
          man of God, Cedd,<a id="noteref_416" name="noteref_416" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_416"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">416</span></span></a> and,
          giving him another priest for his companion, sent them to preach
          the Word to the East Saxons. When these two, travelling to all
          parts of that country, had gathered a numerous Church to the Lord,
          it happened once that Cedd returned home, and came to the church of
          Lindisfarne to confer with Bishop Finan; who, finding that the work
          of the Gospel had prospered in his hands, made him bishop of the
          nation of the East Saxons, calling to him two other bishops<a id="noteref_417" name="noteref_417" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_417"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">417</span></span></a> to
          assist at the ordination. Cedd, having received the episcopal
          dignity, returned to his province, and pursuing the work he had
          begun with more ample authority, built churches in divers places,
          and ordained priests and deacons to assist him in the Word of
          faith, and the ministry of Baptism,<a id="noteref_418" name="noteref_418" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_418"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">418</span></span></a>
          especially in the city which, in the language of the Saxons, is
          called Ythancaestir,<a id="noteref_419" name="noteref_419" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_419"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">419</span></span></a> as

          first of these places is on the bank of the Pant, the other on the
          bank of the Thames. In these, gathering a flock of Christ's
          servants, he taught them to observe the discipline of a rule of
          life, as far as those rude people were then capable of receiving
          it.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page184">[pg

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whilst the
          teaching of the everlasting life was thus, for no small time,
          making daily increase in that province to the joy of the king and
          of all the people, it happened that the king, at the instigation of
          the enemy of all good men, was murdered by his own kindred. They
          were two brothers who did this wicked deed; and being asked what
          had moved them to it, they had nothing else to answer, but that
          they had been incensed against the king, and hated him, because he
          was too apt to spare his enemies, and calmly forgave the wrongs
          they had done him, upon their entreaty. Such was the crime for
          which the king was killed, because he observed the precepts of the
          Gospel with a devout heart; but in this innocent death his real
          offence was also punished, according to the prediction of the man
          of God. For one of those nobles<a id="noteref_421" name="noteref_421" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_421"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">421</span></span></a> that
          murdered him was unlawfully married, and when the bishop was not
          able to prevent or correct the sin, he excommunicated him, and
          commanded all that would give ear to him not to enter this man's
          house, nor to eat of his meat. But the king made light of this
          command, and being invited by the noble, went to a banquet at his
          house. As he was going thence, the bishop met him. The king,
          beholding him, immediately dismounted from his horse, trembling,
          and fell down at his feet, begging pardon for his offence; for the
          bishop, who was likewise on horseback, had also alighted. Being
          much incensed, he touched the prostrate king with the rod he held
          in his hand, and spoke thus with the authority of his office:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“I tell thee, forasmuch as thou wouldest
          not refrain from the house of that sinful and condemned man, thou
          shalt die in that very house.”</span> Yet it is to be believed,
          that such a death of a religious man not only blotted out his
          offence, but even added to his merit; because it happened on
          account of his piety and his observance of the commands of
          Christ.</p>

          of exhortation. Oidilwald,<a id="noteref_425" name="noteref_425" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_425"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">425</span></span></a> the
          son of King Oswald, who reigned among the Deiri, finding him a
          holy, wise, and good man, desired him to accept some land whereon
          to build a monastery, to which the king himself might frequently
          resort, to pray to the Lord and hear the Word, and where he might
          be buried when he died; for he believed faithfully that he should
          receive much benefit from the daily prayers of those who were to
          serve the Lord in that place. The king had before with him a
          brother of the same bishop, called Caelin, a man no less devoted to
          God, who, being a priest, was wont to administer to him and his
          house the Word and the Sacraments of the faith; by whose means he
          chiefly came to know and love the bishop. So then, complying with
          the king's desires, the Bishop chose himself a place whereon to
          build a monastery among steep and distant mountains, which looked
          more like lurking-places for robbers and dens of wild beasts, than
          dwellings of men; to the end that, according <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page186">[pg 186]</span><a name="Pg186" id="Pg186" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> to the prophecy of Isaiah, <span class="tei tei-q">“In the habitation of dragons, where each lay, might be

          is, that the fruits of good works should spring up, where before
          beasts were wont to dwell, or men to live after the manner of
          beasts.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the man of
          God, desiring first to cleanse the place which he had received for
          the monastery from stain of former crimes, by prayer and fasting,
          and so to lay the foundations there, requested of the king that he
          would give him opportunity and leave to abide there for prayer all
          the time of Lent, which was at hand. All which days, except
          Sundays, he prolonged his fast till the evening, according to
          custom, and then took no other sustenance than a small piece of
          bread, one hen's egg, and a little milk and water. This, he said,
          was the custom of those of whom he had learned the rule of regular
          discipline, first to consecrate to the Lord, by prayer and fasting,
          the places which they had newly received for building a monastery
          or a church. When there were ten days of Lent still remaining,
          there came a messenger to call him to the king; and he, that the
          holy work might not be intermitted, on account of the king's
          affairs, entreated his priest, Cynibill, who was also his own
          brother, to complete his pious undertaking. Cynibill readily
          consented, and when the duty of fasting and prayer was over, he
          there built the monastery, which is now called Laestingaeu,<a id="noteref_427" name="noteref_427" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_427"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">427</span></span></a> and
          established therein religious customs according to the use of
          Lindisfarne, where he had been trained.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When Cedd had
          for many years held the office of bishop in the aforesaid province,
          and also taken charge of this monastery, over which he placed
          provosts,<a id="noteref_428" name="noteref_428" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_428"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">428</span></span></a> it
          happened that he came thither at a time when there was plague, and
          fell sick and died. He was first buried <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page187">[pg 187]</span><a name="Pg187" id="Pg187" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> without the walls; but in the process of time
          a church was built of stone in the monastery, in honour of the
          Blessed Mother of God, and his body was laid in it, on the right
          side of the altar.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The bishop left
          the monastery to be governed after him by his brother Ceadda,<a id="noteref_429" name="noteref_429" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_429"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">429</span></span></a> who
          was afterwards made bishop, as shall be told hereafter. For, as it
          rarely happens, the four brothers we have mentioned, Cedd and
          Cynibill, and Caelin and Ceadda, were all celebrated priests of the
          Lord, and two of them also came to be bishops. When the brethren
          who were in his monastery, in the province of the East
          Saxons,<a id="noteref_430" name="noteref_430" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_430"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">430</span></span></a> heard
          that the bishop was dead and buried in the province of the
          Northumbrians, about thirty men of that monastery came thither,
          being desirous either to live near the body of their father, if it
          should please God, or to die and be buried there. Being gladly
          received by their brethren and fellow soldiers in Christ, all of
          them died there struck down by the aforesaid pestilence, except one
          little boy, who is known to have been saved from death by the
          prayers of his spiritual father. For being alive long after, and
          giving himself to the reading of Scripture, he was told that he had
          not been regenerated by the water of Baptism, and being then
          cleansed in the laver of salvation, he was afterwards promoted to
          the order of priesthood, and was of service to many in the church.
          I do not doubt that he was delivered at the point of death, as I
          have said, by the intercession of his father, to whose body he had
          come for love of him, that so he might himself avoid eternal death,
          and by teaching, offer the ministry of life and salvation to others
          of the brethren.</p>

          slain, the province of the Mercians received the faith of Christ,
          and Oswy gave possessions and territories to God, for building
          monasteries, as a thank offering for the victory obtained.

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At this time,
          King Oswy was exposed to the cruel and intolerable invasions of
          Penda, king of the Mercians, whom we have so often mentioned, and
          who had slain his brother;<a id="noteref_431" name="noteref_431" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_431"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">431</span></span></a> at
          length, compelled by his necessity, he promised to give him
          countless gifts and royal marks of honour greater than can be
          believed, to purchase peace; provided that he would return home,
          and cease to waste and utterly destroy the provinces of his
          kingdom. The pagan king refused to grant his request, for he had
          resolved to blot out and extirpate all his nation, from the highest
          to the lowest; whereupon King Oswy had recourse to the protection
          of the Divine pity for deliverance from his barbarous and pitiless
          foe, and binding himself by a vow, said, <span class="tei tei-q">“If the pagan will not accept our gifts, let us offer
          them to Him that will, the Lord our God.”</span> He then vowed,
          that if he should win the victory, he would dedicate his daughter
          to the Lord in holy virginity, and give twelve pieces of land
          whereon to build monasteries. After this he gave battle with a very
          small army: indeed, it is reported that the pagans had thirty times
          the number of men; for they had thirty legions, drawn up under most
          noted commanders.<a id="noteref_432" name="noteref_432" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_432"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">432</span></span></a> King
          Oswy and his son Alchfrid met them with a very small army, as has
          been said, but trusting in Christ as their Leader; his other son,
          Egfrid,<a id="noteref_433" name="noteref_433" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_433"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">433</span></span></a> was
          then kept as a hostage at the court of Queen Cynwise,<a id="noteref_434" name="noteref_434" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_434"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">434</span></span></a>
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page189">[pg 189]</span><a name="Pg189" id="Pg189" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> in the province of

          ought to have supported them, was on the enemy's side, and led them
          on to fight against his country and his uncle; though, during the
          battle, he withdrew, and awaited the event in a place of safety.
          The engagement began, the pagans were put to flight or killed, the
          thirty royal commanders, who had come to Penda's assistance, were
          almost all of them slain; among whom was Ethelhere,<a id="noteref_436" name="noteref_436" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_436"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">436</span></span></a>
          brother and successor to Anna, king of the East Angles. He had been
          the occasion of the war, and was now killed, having lost his army
          and auxiliaries. The battle was fought near the river
          Winwaed,<a id="noteref_437" name="noteref_437" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_437"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">437</span></span></a> which
          then, owing to the great rains, was in flood, and had overflowed
          its banks, so that many more were drowned in the flight than
          destroyed in battle by the sword.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then King Oswy,
          according to the vow he had made to the Lord, returned thanks to
          God for the victory granted him, and gave his daughter
          Elfled,<a id="noteref_438" name="noteref_438" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_438"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">438</span></span></a> who
          was scarce a year old, to be consecrated to Him in perpetual
          virginity; bestowing also twelve small estates of land, wherein the
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page190">[pg 190]</span><a name="Pg190" id="Pg190" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> practice of earthly
          warfare should cease, and place and means should be afforded to
          devout and zealous monks to wage spiritual warfare, and pray for
          the eternal peace of his nation. Of these estates six were in the
          province of the Deiri, and the other six in that of the Bernicians.
          Each of the estates contained ten families, that is, a hundred and
          twenty in all. The aforesaid daughter of King Oswy, who was to be
          dedicated to God, entered the monastery called Heruteu,<a id="noteref_439" name="noteref_439" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_439"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">439</span></span></a> or,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“The Island of the Hart,”</span> at that
          time ruled by the Abbess Hilda,<a id="noteref_440" name="noteref_440" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_440"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">440</span></span></a> who,
          two years after, having acquired an estate of ten families, at the
          place called Streanaeshalch,<a id="noteref_441" name="noteref_441" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_441"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">441</span></span></a> built
          a monastery there, in which the aforesaid king's daughter was first
          trained in the monastic life and afterwards became abbess; till, at
          the age of fifty-nine, the blessed virgin departed to be united to
          her Heavenly Bridegroom. In this monastery, she and her father,
          Oswy, her mother, Eanfled, her mother's father, Edwin,<a id="noteref_442" name="noteref_442" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_442"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">442</span></span></a> and
          many other noble persons, are buried in the church of the holy
          Apostle Peter. King Oswy concluded this war in the district of
          Loidis, in the thirteenth year of his reign, on the 15th of
          November,<a id="noteref_443" name="noteref_443" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_443"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">443</span></span></a> to
          the great benefit of both nations; for he delivered his own people
          from the hostile depredations of the pagans, and, having made an
          end of their heathen chief, converted the Mercians and the adjacent
          provinces to the grace of the Christian faith.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Diuma was made
          the first bishop of the Mercians, as also of Lindsey and the
          Midland Angles, as has been said above,<a id="noteref_444" name="noteref_444" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_444"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">444</span></span></a> and
          he died and was buried among the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page191">[pg 191]</span><a name="Pg191" id="Pg191" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Midland Angles. The second was
          Ceollach,<a id="noteref_445" name="noteref_445" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_445"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">445</span></span></a> who,
          giving up his episcopal office before his death, returned into
          Scotland. Both these bishops belonged to the nation of the Scots.
          The third was Trumhere, an Englishman, but educated and ordained by
          the Scots. He was abbot of the monastery that is called
          Ingetlingum,<a id="noteref_446" name="noteref_446" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_446"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">446</span></span></a> and
          is the place where King Oswin was killed, as has been said above;
          for Queen Eanfled, his kinswoman, in expiation of his unjust death,
          begged of King Oswy that he would give Trumhere, the aforesaid
          servant of God, a place there to build a monastery, because he also
          was kinsman to the slaughtered king; in which monastery continual
          prayers should be offered up for the eternal welfare of the kings,
          both of him that was murdered, and of him that commanded the
          murder. The same King Oswy governed the Mercians, as also the
          people of the other southern provinces, three years after he had
          slain King Penda; and he likewise subdued the greater part of the
          Picts to the dominion of the English.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At this time he
          gave to the above-mentioned Peada, son to King Penda, because he
          was his kinsman, the kingdom of the Southern Mercians,<a id="noteref_447" name="noteref_447" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_447"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">447</span></span></a>
          consisting, as is said, of 5,000 families, divided by the river
          Trent from the Northern Mercians, whose land contains 7,000
          families; but Peada was foully slain in the following spring, by
          the treachery, as is said, of his wife,<a id="noteref_448" name="noteref_448" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_448"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">448</span></span></a>
          during the very time of the Easter festival. Three years after the
          death of King Penda, the Mercian chiefs, Immin, and Eafa, and
          Eadbert, rebelled against King Oswy, setting up for their king,
          Wulfhere,<a id="noteref_449" name="noteref_449" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_449"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">449</span></span></a> son
          to the said Penda, a youth whom they had kept concealed; and
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page192">[pg 192]</span><a name="Pg192" id="Pg192" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> expelling the
          ealdormen of the foreign king, they bravely recovered at once their
          liberty and their lands; and being thus free, together with their
          king, they rejoiced to serve Christ the true King, for the sake of
          an everlasting kingdom in heaven. This king governed the Mercians
          seventeen years, and had for his first bishop Trumhere,<a id="noteref_450" name="noteref_450" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_450"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">450</span></span></a> above

          Bishop Aidan being taken away from this life, Finan, who was
          ordained and sent by the Scots, succeeded him in the bishopric, and
          built a church in the Isle of Lindisfarne, fit for the episcopal

          of stone, but entirely of hewn oak, and covered it with reeds; and
          it was afterwards dedicated in honour of the blessed Peter the
          Apostle, by the most reverend Archbishop Theodore. Eadbert,<a id="noteref_455" name="noteref_455" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_455"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">455</span></span></a> also

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At this time, a
          great and frequently debated question arose about the observance of
          Easter;<a id="noteref_456" name="noteref_456" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_456"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">456</span></span></a> those
          that came from Kent or Gaul affirming, that the Scots celebrated
          Easter Sunday contrary to the custom of the universal Church. Among
          them was a most zealous defender of the true Easter, whose name was
          Ronan,<a id="noteref_457" name="noteref_457" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_457"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">457</span></span></a> a
          Scot by nation, but instructed in the rule of ecclesiastical truth
          in Gaul or Italy. Disputing with Finan, he convinced many, or at
          least induced them to make a more strict inquiry after the truth;
          yet he could not prevail upon Finan, but, on the contrary,
          embittered him the more by reproof, and made him a professed
          opponent of the truth, for he was of a violent temper. James,<a id="noteref_458" name="noteref_458" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_458"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">458</span></span></a>
          formerly the deacon of the venerable Archbishop Paulinus, as has
          been said above, observed the true and Catholic Easter, with all
          those that he could instruct in the better way. Queen Eanfled and
          her followers also observed it as she had seen it practised in
          Kent, having with her a Kentish priest who followed the Catholic
          observance, whose name was Romanus. Thus it is said to have
          sometimes happened in those times that Easter was twice celebrated
          in one year; and that when the king, having ended his fast, was
          keeping Easter, the queen and her followers were still fasting, and
          celebrating Palm Sunday. Whilst Aidan lived, this difference about
          the observance of Easter was patiently tolerated by all men, for
          they well knew, that though he could not keep Easter contrary to
          the custom of those who had sent him, yet he industriously laboured
          to practise the works of faith, piety, and love, according to the
          custom of all holy men; for which reason he was deservedly beloved
          by all, even by those who differed in opinion concerning Easter,
          and was held in veneration, not only by less important persons, but
          even by the bishops, Honorius of Canterbury, and Felix of the East
          Angles.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But after the

          to be bishop, a greater controversy arose about the observance of
          Easter, and other rules of ecclesiastical life. Whereupon this
          question began naturally to influence the thoughts and hearts of
          many who feared, lest haply, having received the name of
          Christians, they might run, or have run, in vain. This reached the
          ears of the rulers, King Oswy and his son Alchfrid. Now Oswy,
          having been instructed and baptized by the Scots, and being very
          perfectly skilled in their language, thought nothing better than
          what they taught; but Alchfrid, having for his teacher in

          archbishop of Gaul, from whom also he had received the crown of
          ecclesiastical tonsure, rightly thought that this man's doctrine
          ought to be preferred before all the traditions of the Scots. For
          this reason he had also given him a monastery of forty families, at
          a place called Inhrypum;<a id="noteref_462" name="noteref_462" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_462"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">462</span></span></a> which
          place, not long before, he had given for a monastery to those that
          were followers of the Scots; but forasmuch as they afterwards,
          being left to their choice, preferred to quit the place rather than
          alter their custom, he gave it to him, whose life and doctrine were
          worthy of it.</p>

          into the province of the Northumbrians, and was staying some time
          among them; at the request of Alchfrid, he made Wilfrid a priest in

          came thither, and the bishops, Colman with his Scottish clerks, and
          Agilbert with the priests Agatho and Wilfrid. James and Romanus
          were on their side; but the Abbess Hilda and her followers were for

          before ordained by the Scots, as has been said above, and he acted
          in that council as a most careful interpreter for both parties.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">King Oswy first
          made an opening speech, in which he said that it behoved those who
          served one God to observe one rule of life; and as they all
          expected the same kingdom in heaven, so they ought not to differ in
          the celebration of the heavenly mysteries; but rather to inquire
          which was the truer tradition, that it might be followed by all in
          common; he then commanded his bishop, Colman, first to declare what
          the custom was which he observed, and whence it derived its origin.
          Then Colman said, <span class="tei tei-q">“The Easter which I keep,
          I received from my elders, who sent me hither as bishop; all our
          forefathers, men beloved of God, are known to have celebrated it
          after the same manner; and that it may not seem to any contemptible
          and worthy to be <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page196">[pg
          196]</span><a name="Pg196" id="Pg196" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          rejected, it is the same which the blessed John the Evangelist, the
          disciple specially beloved of our Lord, with all the churches over
          which he presided, is recorded to have celebrated.”</span><a id="noteref_468" name="noteref_468" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_468"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">468</span></span></a> When
          he had said thus much, and more to the like effect, the king
          commanded Agilbert to make known the manner of his observance and
          to show whence it was derived, and on what authority he followed
          it. Agilbert answered, <span class="tei tei-q">“I beseech you, let
          my disciple, the priest Wilfrid, speak in my stead; because we both
          concur with the other followers of the ecclesiastical tradition
          that are here present, and he can better and more clearly explain
          our opinion in the English language, than I can by an
          interpreter.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then Wilfrid,
          being ordered by the king to speak, began thus:—<span class="tei tei-q">“The Easter which we keep, we saw celebrated by all at
          Rome, where the blessed Apostles, Peter and Paul, lived, taught,
          suffered, and were buried; we saw the same done by all in Italy and
          in Gaul, when we travelled through those countries for the purpose
          of study and prayer. We found it observed in Africa, Asia, Egypt,
          Greece, and all the world, wherever the Church of Christ is spread
          abroad, among divers nations and tongues, at one and the same time;
          save only among these and their accomplices in obstinacy, I mean
          the Picts and the Britons, who foolishly, in these two remote
          islands of the ocean, and only in part even of them, strive to
          oppose all the rest of the world.”</span> When he had so said,
          Colman answered, <span class="tei tei-q">“It is strange that you
          choose to call our efforts foolish, wherein we follow the example
          of so great an Apostle, who was thought worthy to lean on our
          Lord's bosom, when all the world knows him to have lived most
          wisely.”</span> Wilfrid replied, <span class="tei tei-q">“Far be it
          from us to charge John with folly, for he literally observed the
          precepts of the Mosaic Law, whilst the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page197">[pg 197]</span><a name="Pg197" id="Pg197" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Church was still Jewish in many points, and
          the Apostles, lest they should give cause of offence to the Jews
          who were among the Gentiles, were not able at once to cast off all
          the observances of the Law which had been instituted by God, in the
          same way as it is necessary that all who come to the faith should
          forsake the idols which were invented by devils. For this reason it
          was, that Paul circumcised Timothy,<a id="noteref_469" name="noteref_469" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_469"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">469</span></span></a> that
          he offered sacrifice in the temple,<a id="noteref_470" name="noteref_470" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_470"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">470</span></span></a> that
          he shaved his head with Aquila and Priscilla at Corinth;<a id="noteref_471" name="noteref_471" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_471"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">471</span></span></a> for
          no other advantage than to avoid giving offence to the Jews. Hence
          it was, that James said to the same Paul, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Thou seest, brother, how many thousands of Jews there
          are which believe; and they are all zealous of the
          Law.’</span><a id="noteref_472" name="noteref_472" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_472"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">472</span></span></a> And
          yet, at this time, when the light of the Gospel is spreading
          throughout the world, it is needless, nay, it is not lawful, for
          the faithful either to be circumcised, or to offer up to God
          sacrifices of flesh. So John, according to the custom of the Law,
          began the celebration of the feast of Easter, on the fourteenth day
          of the first month, in the evening, not regarding whether the same
          happened on a Saturday, or any other week-day. But when Peter
          preached at Rome, being mindful that our Lord arose from the dead,
          and gave to the world the hope of resurrection, on the first day of
          the week, he perceived that Easter ought to be kept after this
          manner: he always awaited the rising of the moon on the fourteenth
          day of the first month in the evening, according to the custom and
          precepts of the Law, even as John did. And when that came, if the
          Lord's day, then called the first day of the week, was the next
          day, he began that very evening to celebrate Easter, as we all do
          at the present time. But if the Lord's day did not fall the next
          morning after the fourteenth moon, but on the sixteenth, or the
          seventeenth, or any other moon till the twenty-first, he waited for
          that, and on the Saturday before, in the evening, began to observe
          the holy solemnity of Easter. Thus it came <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page198">[pg 198]</span><a name="Pg198" id="Pg198" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> to pass, that Easter Sunday was only kept
          from the fifteenth moon to the twenty-first. Nor does this
          evangelical and apostolic tradition abolish the Law, but rather
          fulfil it; the command being to keep the passover from the
          fourteenth moon of the first month in the evening to the
          twenty-first moon of the same month in the evening; which
          observance all the successors of the blessed John in Asia, since
          his death, and all the Church throughout the world, have since
          followed; and that this is the true Easter, and the only one to be
          celebrated by the faithful, was not newly decreed by the council of
          Nicaea, but only confirmed afresh; as the history of the Church
          informs us.<a id="noteref_473" name="noteref_473" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_473"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">473</span></span></a></span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Thus it is plain, that you, Colman, neither follow the
          example of John, as you imagine, nor that of Peter, whose tradition
          you oppose with full knowledge, and that you neither agree with the
          Law nor the Gospel in the keeping of your Easter. For John, keeping
          the Paschal time according to the decree of the Mosaic Law, had no
          regard to the first day of the week, which you do not practise,
          seeing that you celebrate Easter only on the first day after the
          Sabbath. Peter celebrated Easter Sunday between the fifteenth and
          the twenty-first moon, which you do not practise, seeing that you
          observe Easter Sunday from the fourteenth to the twentieth moon; so
          that you often begin Easter on the thirteenth moon in the evening,
          whereof neither the Law made any mention, nor did our Lord, the
          Author and Giver of the Gospel, on that day either eat the old
          passover in the evening, or deliver the Sacraments of the New
          Testament, to be celebrated by the Church, in memory of His
          Passion, but on the fourteenth. Besides, in your celebration of
          Easter, you utterly exclude the twenty-first moon, which the Law
          ordered to be specially observed. Thus, as I have said before, you
          agree neither with John nor Peter, nor with the Law, nor the
          Gospel, in the celebration of the greatest festival.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To this Colman
          rejoined: <span class="tei tei-q">“Did the holy Anatolius,<a id="noteref_474" name="noteref_474" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_474"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">474</span></span></a>
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page199">[pg 199]</span><a name="Pg199" id="Pg199" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> much commended in
          the history of the Church, judge contrary to the Law and the
          Gospel, when he wrote, that Easter was to be celebrated from the
          fourteenth to the twentieth moon? Is it to be believed that our
          most reverend Father Columba and his successors, men beloved by
          God, who kept Easter after the same manner, judged or acted
          contrary to the Divine writings? Whereas there were many among
          them, whose sanctity was attested by heavenly signs and miracles
          which they wrought; whom I, for my part, doubt not to be saints,
          and whose life, customs, and discipline I never cease to
          follow.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“It is evident,”</span> said Wilfrid, <span class="tei tei-q">“that Anatolius was a most holy, learned, and
          commendable man; but what have you to do with him, since you do not
          observe his decrees? For he undoubtedly, following the rule of
          truth in his Easter, appointed a cycle of nineteen years, which
          either you are ignorant of, or if you know it, though it is kept by
          the whole Church of Christ, yet you despise it as a thing of
          naught. He so computed the fourteenth moon in our Lord's Paschal
          Feast, that according to the custom of the Egyptians, he
          acknowledged it to be the fifteenth moon on that same day in the
          evening; so in like manner he assigned the twentieth to
          Easter-Sunday, as believing that to be the twenty-first moon, when
          the sun had set. That you are ignorant of the rule of this
          distinction is proved by this, that you sometimes manifestly keep
          Easter before the full moon, that is, on the thirteenth day.
          Concerning your Father Columba and his followers, whose sanctity
          you say you imitate, and whose rule and precepts confirmed by signs
          from Heaven you say that you follow, I might answer, then when
          many, in the day of judgement, shall say to our Lord, that in His
          name they have prophesied, and have cast out devils, and done many
          wonderful works, our Lord will reply, that He never knew them. But
          far be it from me to speak thus of your fathers, for it is much
          more just to believe good than evil of those whom we know not.
          Wherefore I do not deny those also to have been God's servants, and
          beloved of God, who with rude <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page200">[pg 200]</span><a name="Pg200" id="Pg200" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> simplicity, but pious intentions, have
          themselves loved Him. Nor do I think that such observance of Easter
          did them much harm, as long as none came to show them a more
          perfect rule to follow; for assuredly I believe that, if any
          teacher, reckoning after the Catholic manner, had come among them,
          they would have as readily followed his admonitions, as they are
          known to have kept those commandments of God, which they had
          learned and knew.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“But as for you and your companions, you certainly sin,
          if, having heard the decrees of the Apostolic see, nay, of the
          universal Church, confirmed, as they are, by Holy Scripture, you
          scorn to follow them; for, though your fathers were holy, do you
          think that those few men, in a corner of the remotest island, are
          to be preferred before the universal Church of Christ throughout
          the world? And if that Columba of yours, (and, I may say, ours
          also, if he was Christ's servant,) was a holy man and powerful in
          miracles, yet could he be preferred before the most blessed chief
          of the Apostles, to whom our Lord said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my
          Church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it, and I

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When Wilfrid had
          ended thus, the king said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Is it true,
          Colman, that these words were spoken to Peter by our Lord?”</span>
          He answered, <span class="tei tei-q">“It is true, O king!”</span>
          Then said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“Can you show any such power
          given to your Columba?”</span> Colman answered, <span class="tei tei-q">“None.”</span> Then again the king asked, <span class="tei tei-q">“Do you both agree in this, without any controversy,
          that these words were said above all to Peter, and that the keys of
          the kingdom of Heaven were given to him by our Lord?”</span> They
          both answered, <span class="tei tei-q">“Yes.”</span> Then the king
          concluded, <span class="tei tei-q">“And I also say unto you, that
          he is the door-keeper, and I will not gainsay him, but I desire, as
          far as I know and am able, in all things to obey his laws, lest

          or standing by, both great and small, gave their assent, and
          renouncing the less perfect custom, hastened to conform to that

          there was no small dispute about that also,) and went back into
          Scotland,<a id="noteref_477" name="noteref_477" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_477"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">477</span></span></a> to
          consult with his people what was to be done in this case. Cedd,
          forsaking the practices of the Scots, returned to his bishopric,
          having submitted to the Catholic observance of Easter. This debate
          took place in the year of our Lord 664, which was the twenty-second
          year of the reign of King Oswy, and the thirtieth of the episcopate
          of the Scots among the English; for Aidan was bishop seventeen
          years, Finan ten, and Colman three.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When Colman had
          gone back into his own country, Tuda, the servant of Christ, was
          made bishop of the Northumbrians<a id="noteref_478" name="noteref_478" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_478"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">478</span></span></a> in
          his place, having been instructed and ordained bishop among the
          Southern Scots, having also the crown of the ecclesiastical

          was a good and religious man, but he governed the church a very
          short time; he had come from Scotland<a id="noteref_480" name="noteref_480" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_480"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">480</span></span></a>
          whilst Colman was <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page202">[pg
          202]</span><a name="Pg202" id="Pg202" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          yet bishop, and, both by word and deed, diligently taught all men
          those things that appertain to the faith and truth. But Eata,<a id="noteref_481" name="noteref_481" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_481"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">481</span></span></a> who
          was abbot of the monastery called Mailros,<a id="noteref_482" name="noteref_482" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_482"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">482</span></span></a> a man
          most reverend and gentle, was appointed abbot over the brethren
          that chose to remain in the church of Lindisfarne, when the Scots
          went away. It is said that Colman, upon his departure, requested
          and obtained this of King Oswy, because Eata was one of Aidan's
          twelve boys of the English nation,<a id="noteref_483" name="noteref_483" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_483"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">483</span></span></a> whom
          he received in the early years of his episcopate, to be instructed
          in Christ; for the king greatly loved Bishop Colman on account of
          his innate discretion. This is that Eata, who, not long after, was
          made bishop of the same church of Lindisfarne. Colman carried home
          with him part of the bones of the most reverend Father Aidan, and
          left part of them in the church where he had presided, ordering
          them to be interred in the sacristy.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The place which
          they governed shows how frugal and temperate he and his
          predecessors were, for there were very few houses besides the
          church found at their departure; indeed, no more than were barely
          sufficient to make civilized life possible; they had also no money,
          but only cattle; for if they received any money from rich persons,
          they immediately gave it to the poor; there being no need to gather
          money, or provide houses for the entertainment of the great men of
          the world; for such never resorted to the church, except to pray
          and hear the Word of God. The king himself, when occasion required,
          came only with five or six servants, and having performed his
          devotions in the church, departed. But if they happened to take a
          repast there, they were satisfied with the plain, daily food of the
          brethren, and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page203">[pg
          203]</span><a name="Pg203" id="Pg203" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          required no more. For the whole care of those teachers was to serve
          God, not the world—to feed the soul, and not the belly.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For this reason
          the religious habit was at that time held in great veneration; so
          that wheresoever any clerk or monk went, he was joyfully received
          by all men, as God's servant; and even if they chanced to meet him
          upon the way, they ran to him, and with bowed head, were glad to be
          signed with the cross by his hand, or blessed by his lips. Great
          attention was also paid to their exhortations; and on Sundays they
          flocked eagerly to the church, or the monasteries, not to feed
          their bodies, but to hear the Word of God; and if any priest
          happened to come into a village, the inhabitants came together and
          asked of him the Word of life; for the priests and clerks went to
          the villages for no other reason than to preach, baptize, visit the
          sick, and, in a word, to take care of souls; and they were so
          purified from all taint of avarice, that none of them received
          lands and possessions for building monasteries, unless they were
          compelled to do so by the temporal authorities; which custom was
          for some time after universally observed in the churches of the
          Northumbrians. But enough has now been said on this subject.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the same year

          province of the Northumbrians, ravaged the country far and near,
          and destroyed a great multitude of men. By this plague the
          aforesaid priest of the Lord, Tuda,<a id="noteref_486" name="noteref_486" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_486"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">486</span></span></a> was

          Moreover, this plague prevailed no less disastrously in the island
          of Ireland. Many of the nobility, and of the lower ranks of the
          English nation, were there at that time, who, in the days of the
          Bishops Finan and Colman, forsaking their native island, retired
          thither, either for the sake of sacred studies, or of a more
          ascetic life; and some of them presently devoted themselves
          faithfully to a monastic life, others chose rather to apply
          themselves to study, going about from one master's cell to another.
          The Scots willingly received them all, and took care to supply them
          with daily food without cost, as also to furnish them with books
          for their studies, and teaching free of charge.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among these were
          Ethelhun and Egbert,<a id="noteref_488" name="noteref_488" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_488"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">488</span></span></a> two
          youths of great capacity, of the English nobility. The former of
          whom was brother to Ethelwin,<a id="noteref_489" name="noteref_489" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_489"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">489</span></span></a> a man
          no less beloved by God, who also at a later time went over into
          Ireland to study, and having been well instructed, returned into
          his own country, and being made bishop in the province of Lindsey,
          long and nobly governed the Church. These two being in the
          monastery which in the language of the Scots is called
          Rathmelsigi,<a id="noteref_490" name="noteref_490" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_490"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">490</span></span></a> and
          having lost all their companions, who were either cut off by the
          plague, or dispersed into other places, were both seized by the
          same sickness, and grievously afflicted. Of these, Egbert, (as I
          was informed by a priest venerable for his <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page205">[pg 205]</span><a name="Pg205" id="Pg205" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> age, and of great veracity, who declared he
          had heard the story from his own lips,) concluding that he was at
          the point of death, went out of the chamber, where the sick lay, in
          the morning, and sitting alone in a fitting place, began seriously
          to reflect upon his past actions, and, being full of compunction at
          the remembrance of his sins, bedewed his face with tears, and
          prayed fervently to God that he might not die yet, before he could
          forthwith more fully make amends for the careless offences which he
          had committed in his boyhood and infancy, or might further exercise
          himself in good works. He also made a vow that he would spend all
          his life abroad and never return into the island of Britain, where
          he was born; that besides singing the psalms at the canonical
          hours, he would, unless prevented by bodily infirmity, repeat the
          whole Psalter daily to the praise of God; and that he would every
          week fast one whole day and night. Returning home, after his tears
          and prayers and vows, he found his companion asleep; and going to
          bed himself, he began to compose himself to rest. When he had lain
          quiet awhile, his comrade awaking, looked on him, and said,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Alas! Brother Egbert, what have you done?
          I was in hopes that we should have entered together into life
          everlasting; but know that your prayer is granted.”</span> For he
          had learned in a vision what the other had requested, and that he
          had obtained his request.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In brief,
          Ethelhun died the next night; but Egbert, throwing off his
          sickness, recovered and lived a long time after to grace the
          episcopal office, which he received, by deeds worthy of it;<a id="noteref_491" name="noteref_491" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_491"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">491</span></span></a> and
          blessed with many virtues, according to his desire, lately, in the
          year of our Lord 729, being ninety years of age, he departed to the
          heavenly kingdom. He passed his life in great perfection of
          humility, gentleness, continence, simplicity, and justice. Thus he
          was a great benefactor, both to his own people, and to those
          nations of the Scots and Picts among whom he lived in exile, by the
          example of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page206">[pg
          206]</span><a name="Pg206" id="Pg206" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          his life, his earnestness in teaching, his authority in reproving,
          and his piety in giving away of those things which he received from
          the rich. He also added this to the vows which we have mentioned:
          during Lent, he would eat but one meal a day, allowing himself
          nothing but bread and thin milk, and even that by measure. The
          milk, new the day before, he kept in a vessel, and skimming off the
          cream in the morning, drank the rest, as has been said, with a
          little bread. Which sort of abstinence he likewise always observed
          forty days before the Nativity of our Lord, and as many after the
          solemnity of Pentecost, that is, of the fifty days' festival.</p>

          of modest character, well read in the Scripture, and diligently
          practising those things which he had learned therein, to be
          ordained bishop of the church of York. This was a priest called

          brother to the most reverend prelate Cedd, of whom mention has been
          often made, and abbot of the monastery of Laestingaeu. With him the
          king also sent his priest Eadhaed,<a id="noteref_497" name="noteref_497" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_497"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">497</span></span></a> who

          bishop of the church of Ripon. Now when they arrived in Kent, they
          found that Archbishop Deusdedit had departed this life, and no
          other bishop was as yet appointed in his place; whereupon they
          betook themselves to the province of the West Saxons, where Wini
          was bishop, and by him Ceadda was consecrated; two bishops of the
          British nation, who kept Easter Sunday, as has been often said,
          contrary to the canonical manner, from the fourteenth to the
          twentieth moon, being called in to assist at the ordination; for at
          that time there was no other bishop in all Britain canonically
          ordained, except Wini.<a id="noteref_499" name="noteref_499" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_499"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">499</span></span></a></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So Ceadda, being
          consecrated bishop, began immediately to labour for ecclesiastical
          truth and purity of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page208">[pg
          208]</span><a name="Pg208" id="Pg208" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          doctrine; to apply himself to humility, self-denial, and study; to
          travel about, not on horseback, but after the manner of the
          Apostles, on foot, to preach the Gospel in towns, the open country,
          cottages, villages, and castles; for he was one of the disciples of
          Aidan, and endeavoured to instruct his people by the same manner of
          life and character, after his and his own brother Cedd's example.
          Wilfrid also having been now made a bishop, came into Britain, and

          that province was suffering from the aforesaid disastrous plague,
          Sighere, with his part of the people, forsook the mysteries of the
          Christian faith, and turned apostate. For the king himself, and
          many of the commons and nobles, loving this life, and not seeking
          after another, or even not believing in any other, began to restore
          the temples that had been abandoned, and to adore idols, as if they
          might by those means be protected against the plague. But Sebbi,
          his companion and co-heir in the kingdom, with all his people, very
          devoutly preserved the faith which he had received, and, as we
          shall show hereafter, ended his faithful life in great
          felicity.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">King Wulfhere,

          was successor to Trumhere, to correct their error, and recall the
          province to the true faith. He acted with much discretion, as I was
          informed by a priest who bore him company in that journey, and had
          been his fellow labourer in the Word, for he was a religious and
          good man, and travelling through all the country, far and near,
          brought back both the people and the aforesaid king to the way of
          righteousness, so that, either forsaking or destroying the temples
          and altars which they had erected, they opened the churches, and
          gladly confessed the Name of Christ, which they had opposed,
          choosing rather to die in the faith of resurrection in Him, than to
          live in the abominations of unbelief among their idols. Having thus
          accomplished their works, the priests and teachers returned home

          then in the monastery of Niridanum, which is not far from Naples in
          Campania, an abbot called Hadrian,<a id="noteref_522" name="noteref_522" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_522"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">522</span></span></a> by
          nation an African, well versed in Holy Scripture, trained in
          monastic and ecclesiastical teaching, and excellently skilled both
          in the Greek and Latin tongues. The pope, sending for him,
          commanded him to accept the bishopric and go to Britain. He
          answered, that he was unworthy of so great a dignity, but said that
          he could name another, whose learning and age were fitter for the
          episcopal office. He proposed to the pope a certain monk named
          Andrew, belonging to a neighbouring nunnery<a id="noteref_523" name="noteref_523" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_523"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">523</span></span></a> and
          he was by all that knew him judged worthy of a bishopric; but the
          weight of bodily infirmity prevented him from becoming a bishop.
          Then again Hadrian was urged to accept the episcopate; but he
          desired a respite, to see whether in time he could find another to
          be ordained bishop.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There was at
          that time in Rome, a monk, called Theodore,<a id="noteref_524" name="noteref_524" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_524"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">524</span></span></a> known
          to Hadrian, born at Tarsus in Cilicia, a man instructed in secular
          and Divine writings, as also in Greek and Latin; of high character
          and venerable age, being sixty-six years old. Hadrian proposed him
          to the pope to be ordained bishop, and prevailed; but upon the
          condition that he should himself conduct him into Britain, because
          he had already travelled through Gaul twice upon different
          occasions, and was, therefore, better acquainted with the way, and
          was, moreover, sufficiently provided with men of his own; as also,
          to the end that, being his fellow labourer in teaching, he might
          take special care that Theodore should not, according to the custom
          of the Greeks, introduce any thing contrary to the truth of the
          faith into the Church where he presided.<a id="noteref_525" name="noteref_525" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_525"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">525</span></span></a>
          Theodore, being ordained subdeacon, waited four months for his hair
          to grow, that it might be shorn into the shape of a <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page215">[pg 215]</span><a name="Pg215" id="Pg215" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> crown; for he had before the tonsure of
          St. Paul,<a id="noteref_526" name="noteref_526" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_526"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">526</span></span></a> the
          Apostle, after the manner of the eastern people. He was ordained by
          Pope Vitalian, in the year of our Lord 668, on Sunday, the 26th of
          March, and on the 27th of May was sent with Hadrian to
          Britain.<a id="noteref_527" name="noteref_527" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_527"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">527</span></span></a></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They proceeded
          together by sea to Marseilles, and thence by land to Arles, and
          having there delivered to John, archbishop of that city,<a id="noteref_528" name="noteref_528" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_528"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">528</span></span></a> Pope
          Vitalian's letters of recommendation, were by him detained till

          king's mayor of the palace, gave them leave to go where they
          pleased. Having received the same, Theodore went to Agilbert,
          bishop of Paris,<a id="noteref_530" name="noteref_530" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_530"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">530</span></span></a> of
          whom we have spoken above, and was by him kindly received, and long
          entertained. But Hadrian went first to Emme, Bishop of the
          Senones,<a id="noteref_531" name="noteref_531" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_531"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">531</span></span></a> and
          then to Faro,<a id="noteref_532" name="noteref_532" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_532"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">532</span></span></a>
          bishop of the Meldi, and lived in comfort with them a considerable
          time; for the approach of winter had obliged them to rest wherever
          they could. King Egbert, being informed by sure messengers that the
          bishop they had asked of the Roman prelate was in the kingdom of
          the Franks, sent thither his reeve,<a id="noteref_533" name="noteref_533" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_533"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">533</span></span></a>
          Raedfrid, to conduct him. He, having arrived there, with Ebroin's
          leave took Theodore and conveyed him to the port called
          Quentavic;<a id="noteref_534" name="noteref_534" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_534"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">534</span></span></a>
          where, falling sick, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page216">[pg
          216]</span><a name="Pg216" id="Pg216" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          he stayed some time, and as soon as he began to recover, sailed
          over into Britain. But Ebroin detained Hadrian, suspecting that he
          went on some mission from the Emperor to the kings of Britain, to
          the prejudice of the kingdom of which he at that time had the chief
          charge; however, when he found that in truth he had never had any
          such commission, he discharged him, and permitted him to follow
          Theodore. As soon as he came to him, Theodore gave him the
          monastery of the blessed Peter the Apostle,<a id="noteref_535" name="noteref_535" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_535"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">535</span></span></a> where
          the archbishops of Canterbury are wont to be buried, as I have said
          before; for at his departure, the Apostolic lord had enjoined upon
          Theodore that he should provide for him in his province, and give
          him a suitable place to live in with his followers.</p>

          the study of Holy Scripture, and in the Catholic truth; and how

          Damianus. [669</span> <span class="tei tei-hi" style="text-align: left"><span style="font-size: 144%; font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span><span style="font-size: 144%">]</span></h2>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Theodore came to
          his Church in the second year after his consecration, on Sunday,
          the 27th of May, and spent in it twenty-one years, three months,
          and twenty-six days. Soon after, he visited all the island,
          wherever the tribes of the English dwelt, for he was gladly
          received and heard by all persons; and everywhere attended and
          assisted by Hadrian, he taught the right rule of life, and the
          canonical custom of celebrating Easter. This was the first
          archbishop whom all the English Church consented to obey. And
          forasmuch as both of them were, as has been said before, fully
          instructed both in sacred and in secular letters, they gathered a
          crowd of disciples, and rivers of wholesome knowledge daily flowed
          from them to water the hearts of their hearers; and, together with
          the books of Holy Scripture, they also taught them <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page217">[pg 217]</span><a name="Pg217" id="Pg217" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the metrical art, astronomy, and
          ecclesiastical arithmetic. A testimony whereof is, that there are
          still living at this day some of their scholars, who are as well
          versed in the Greek and Latin tongues as in their own, in which
          they were born. Nor were there ever happier times since the English
          came into Britain; for having brave Christian kings, they were a
          terror to all barbarous nations, and the minds of all men were bent
          upon the joys of the heavenly kingdom of which they had but lately
          heard; and all who desired to be instructed in sacred studies had
          masters at hand to teach them.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From that time
          also they began in all the churches of the English to learn Church
          music, which till then had been only known in Kent. And, excepting
          James, of whom we have spoken above,<a id="noteref_536" name="noteref_536" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_536"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">536</span></span></a> the

          invited from Kent by the most reverend Wilfrid, who was the first
          of the bishops of the English nation that learned to deliver to the
          churches of the English the Catholic manner of life.<a id="noteref_538" name="noteref_538" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_538"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">538</span></span></a></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Theodore,
          journeying through all parts, ordained bishops in fitting places,
          and with their assistance corrected such things as he found faulty.
          Among the rest, when he charged Bishop Ceadda with not having been
          duly consecrated,<a id="noteref_539" name="noteref_539" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_539"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">539</span></span></a> he,
          with great humility, answered, <span class="tei tei-q">“If you know
          that I have not duly received episcopal ordination, I willingly
          resign the office, for I never thought myself worthy of it; but,
          though unworthy, for obedience sake I submitted, when bidden to
          undertake it.”</span> Theodore, hearing his humble answer, said
          that he should not resign the bishopric, and he himself completed
          his ordination after the Catholic manner. Now at the time when
          Deusdedit died, and a bishop for the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page218">[pg 218]</span><a name="Pg218" id="Pg218" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> church of Canterbury was by request ordained
          and sent, Wilfrid was also sent from Britain into Gaul to be
          ordained; and because he returned before Theodore, he ordained
          priests and deacons in Kent till the archbishop should come to his
          see. But when Theodore came to the city of Rochester, where the
          bishopric had been long vacant by the death of Damian,<a id="noteref_540" name="noteref_540" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_540"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">540</span></span></a> he

          trained rather in the teaching of the Church and more addicted to
          simplicity of life than active in worldly affairs, but specially
          skilful in Church music, after the Roman use, which he had learned
          from the disciples of the blessed Pope Gregory.<a id="noteref_542" name="noteref_542" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_542"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">542</span></span></a></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At that time,
          the province of the Mercians was governed by King Wulfhere, who, on
          the death of Jaruman,<a id="noteref_543" name="noteref_543" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_543"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">543</span></span></a>
          desired of Theodore that a bishop should be given to him and his
          people; but Theodore would not ordain a new one for them, but
          requested of King Oswy that Ceadda might be their bishop. He then
          lived in retirement at his monastery, which is at
          Laestingaeu,<a id="noteref_544" name="noteref_544" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_544"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">544</span></span></a> while
          Wilfrid administered the bishopric of York, and of all <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page219">[pg 219]</span><a name="Pg219" id="Pg219" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the Northumbrians, and likewise of the
          Picts, as far as King Oswy was able to extend his dominions. And,
          seeing that it was the custom of that most reverend prelate to go
          about the work of the Gospel everywhere on foot rather than on
          horseback, Theodore commanded him to ride whenever he had a long
          journey to undertake; and finding him very unwilling, in his zeal
          and love for his pious labour, he himself, with his own hands,
          lifted him on horseback; for he knew him to be a holy man, and
          therefore obliged him to ride wherever he had need to go. Ceadda
          having received the bishopric of the Mercians and of Lindsey,<a id="noteref_545" name="noteref_545" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_545"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">545</span></span></a> took
          care to administer it with great perfection of life, according to
          the example of the ancient fathers. King Wulfhere also gave him
          land of the extent of fifty families, to build a monastery, at the
          place called Ad Barvae,<a id="noteref_546" name="noteref_546" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_546"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">546</span></span></a> or
          <span class="tei tei-q">“At the Wood,”</span> in the province of
          Lindsey, wherein traces of the monastic life instituted by him
          continue to this day.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He had his
          episcopal see in the place called Lyccidfelth,<a id="noteref_547" name="noteref_547" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_547"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">547</span></span></a> in
          which he also died, and was buried, and where the see of the
          succeeding bishops of that province continues to this day. He had
          built himself a retired habitation not far from the church, wherein
          he was wont to pray and read in private, with a few, it might be
          seven or eight of the brethren, as often as he had any spare
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page220">[pg 220]</span><a name="Pg220" id="Pg220" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> time from the labour
          and ministry of the Word. When he had most gloriously governed the
          church in that province for two years and a half, the Divine
          Providence so ordaining, there came round a season like that of
          which Ecclesiastes says, <span class="tei tei-q">“That there is a
          time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones
          together;”</span><a id="noteref_548" name="noteref_548" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_548"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">548</span></span></a> for a
          plague fell upon them, sent from Heaven, which, by means of the
          death of the flesh, translated the living stones of the Church from
          their earthly places to the heavenly building. And when, after many
          of the Church of that most reverend prelate had been taken away out
          of the flesh, his hour also drew near wherein he was to pass out of
          this world to the Lord, it happened one day that he was in the
          aforesaid habitation with only one brother, called Owini,<a id="noteref_549" name="noteref_549" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_549"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">549</span></span></a> his
          other companions having upon some due occasion returned to the
          church. Now Owini was a monk of great merit, having forsaken the
          world with the sole desire of the heavenly reward; worthy in all
          respects to have the secrets of the Lord revealed to him in special
          wise, and worthy to have credit given by his hearers to what he
          said. For he had come with Queen Ethelthryth<a id="noteref_550" name="noteref_550" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_550"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">550</span></span></a> from
          the province of the East Angles, and was the chief of her thegns,
          and governor of her house. As the fervour of his faith increased,
          resolving to renounce the secular life, he did not go about it
          slothfully, but so entirely forsook the things of this world, that,
          quitting all that he had, clad in a plain garment, and carrying an
          axe and hatchet in his hand, he came to the monastery of the same
          most reverend father, which is called Laestingaeu. He said that he
          was not entering the monastery in order to live in idleness, as
          some do, but to labour; which he also confirmed by practice; for as
          he was less capable of studying the Scriptures, the more earnestly
          he applied himself to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page221">[pg
          221]</span><a name="Pg221" id="Pg221" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          the labour of his hands. So then, forasmuch as he was reverent and
          devout, he was kept by the bishop in the aforesaid habitation with
          the brethren, and whilst they were engaged within in reading, he
          was without, doing such things as were necessary.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One day, when he
          was thus employed abroad, his companions having gone to the church,
          as I began to tell, and the bishop was alone reading or praying in
          the oratory of that place, on a sudden, as he afterwards said, he
          heard a sweet sound of singing and rejoicing descend from heaven to
          earth. This sound he said he first heard coming from the sky in the
          south-east, above the winter sunrise, and that afterwards it drew
          near him gradually, till it came to the roof of the oratory where
          the bishop was, and entering therein, filled all the place and
          encompassed it about. He listened attentively to what he heard, and
          after about half an hour, perceived the same song of joy to ascend
          from the roof of the said oratory, and to return to heaven in the
          same way as it came, with unspeakable sweetness. When he had stood
          some time amazed, and earnestly considering in his mind what this
          might be, the bishop opened the window of the oratory, and making a
          sound with his hand, as he was often wont to do, bade anyone who
          might be without to come in to him. He went hastily in, and the
          bishop said to him, <span class="tei tei-q">“Make haste to the
          church, and cause those seven brothers to come hither, and do you
          come with them.”</span> When they were come, he first admonished
          them to preserve the virtue of love and peace among themselves, and
          towards all the faithful; and with unwearied earnestness to follow
          the rules of monastic discipline, which they had either been taught
          by him, and had seen him observe, or had found in the words and
          actions of the former fathers. Then he added that the day of his
          death was at hand; for, said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“that
          gracious guest, who was wont to visit our brethren, has vouchsafed
          also to come to me this day, and to call me out of this world.
          Return, therefore, to the church, and speak to the brethren, that
          in their prayers they commend my departure to the Lord, and that
          they be <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page222">[pg
          222]</span><a name="Pg222" id="Pg222" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          mindful to prepare for their own, the hour whereof is uncertain, by
          watching, and prayer, and good works.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When he had
          spoken thus much and more to the same end, and they, having
          received his blessing, had gone away in great sorrow, he who had
          heard the heavenly song returned alone, and prostrating himself on
          the ground, said, <span class="tei tei-q">“I beseech you, father,
          may I be permitted to ask a question?”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Ask what you will,”</span> answered the bishop. Then
          he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“I beseech you to tell me what was
          that song which I heard as of a joyful company coming from heaven
          upon this oratory, and after some time returning to heaven?”</span>
          The bishop answered: <span class="tei tei-q">“If you heard the
          singing, and know of the coming of the heavenly company, I command
          you, in the Name of the Lord, that you tell it not to any before my
          death. But in truth they were angelic spirits, who came to call me
          to my heavenly reward, which I have always loved and longed after,
          and they promised that they would return seven days hence, and take
          me away with them.”</span> Which was indeed fulfilled, as had been
          said to him; for being presently seized with bodily infirmity, and
          the same daily increasing, on the seventh day, as had been promised
          to him, when he had prepared for death by receiving the Body and
          Blood of our Lord, his saintly soul being delivered from the prison
          of the body, led, as may justly be believed, by the attendant
          angels, he departed to the joys of Heaven.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is no wonder
          that he joyfully beheld the day of his death, or rather the day of
          the Lord, the coming whereof he had always been mindful to await
          with earnest expectation. For with all his merits of continence,
          humility, teaching, prayer, voluntary poverty, and other virtues,
          he was so filled with the fear of the Lord, so mindful of his
          latter end in all his actions, that, as I was wont to hear from one
          of the brothers who instructed me in the Scriptures, and who had
          been bred in his monastery, and under his direction, whose name was
          Trumbert, if it happened that there blew a sudden strong gust of
          wind, when he was reading or doing any other thing, he forthwith
          called upon the Lord for mercy, and begged <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page223">[pg 223]</span><a name="Pg223" id="Pg223" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> that it might be granted to all mankind. If
          the wind grew stronger, he closed his book, and fell on his face,
          praying still more earnestly. But, if a violent storm of wind or
          rain came on, or if the earth and air were filled with the terror
          of thunder and lightning, he would go to the church, and anxiously
          devote himself with all his heart to prayers and psalms till the
          weather became calm. Being asked by his brethren why he did so, he
          answered, <span class="tei tei-q">“Have not you read—<span class="tei tei-q">‘The Lord also thundered in the heavens, and the
          Highest gave his voice. Yea, he sent out his arrows and scattered
          them; and he shot out lightnings, and discomfited
          them.’</span><a id="noteref_551" name="noteref_551" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_551"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">551</span></span></a> For
          the Lord moves the air, raises the winds, hurls lightning, and
          thunders from heaven, to rouse the inhabitants of the earth to fear
          him; to put them in mind of judgement to come; to dispel their
          pride, and confound their boldness, by recalling to their thoughts
          that dread time, when the heavens and the earth being on fire, He
          will come in the clouds, with great power and majesty, to judge the
          quick and the dead. Wherefore,”</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“it behoves us to respond to His heavenly admonition
          with due fear and love; that, as often as the air is moved and He
          puts forth His hand threatening to strike, but does not yet let it
          fall, we may immediately implore His mercy; and searching the
          recesses of our hearts, and casting out the dregs of our sins, we
          may carefully so act that we may never deserve to be struck
          down.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With this
          revelation and narrative of the aforesaid brother, concerning the
          death of this prelate, agrees the account of the most reverend
          Father Egbert, above spoken of,<a id="noteref_552" name="noteref_552" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_552"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">552</span></span></a> who
          long and zealously led a monastic life with the same Ceadda, when
          both were youths, in Ireland, in prayer and self-denial and
          meditation on the Holy Scriptures. But whereas Ceadda afterwards
          returned into his own country, Egbert continued to live abroad for
          the Lord's sake till the end of his life. A long time after,
          Hygbald, a man of great holiness and continence, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page224">[pg 224]</span><a name="Pg224" id="Pg224" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> who was an abbot in the province of
          Lindsey,<a id="noteref_553" name="noteref_553" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_553"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">553</span></span></a> came
          from Britain to visit him, and whilst, as became holy men, they
          were discoursing of the life of the former fathers, and rejoicing
          to imitate the same, mention was made of the most reverend prelate,
          Ceadda; whereupon Egbert said, <span class="tei tei-q">“I know a
          man in this island, still in the flesh, who, when Ceadda passed
          away from this world, saw the soul of his brother Cedd, with a
          company of angels, descending from heaven, who, having taken
          Ceadda's soul along with them, returned again to the heavenly
          kingdom.”</span> Whether he said this of himself, or some other, we
          do not certainly know; but because it was said by so great a man,
          there can be no doubt of the truth thereof.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Ceadda died on
          the 2nd of March,<a id="noteref_554" name="noteref_554" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_554"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">554</span></span></a> and
          was first buried by St. Mary's Church, but afterwards, when the
          church of the most blessed chief of the Apostles, Peter, was built
          in the same place, his bones were translated into it. In both which
          places, as a testimony of his virtue, frequent miracles of healing
          are wont to be wrought. And of late, a certain man that had a
          frenzy, wandering about everywhere, arrived there in the evening,
          unperceived or disregarded by the keepers of the place, and having
          rested there the whole of the night, came forth in his right mind
          the next morning, to the surprise and joy of all, and told what a
          cure had been wrought on him through the goodness of God. The place
          of the sepulchre is a wooden monument, made like a little house,
          covered, having a hole in the wall, through which those that go
          thither for devotion are wont to put in their hand and take out
          some of the dust. This they put into water and give to sick cattle
          or men to drink, whereupon they are presently eased of their
          infirmity, and restored to their desired health.</p>

          for both these companies had been trained in duties of the monastic
          life; and leaving some brothers in his church, he went first to the
          isle of Hii,<a id="noteref_557" name="noteref_557" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_557"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">557</span></span></a>
          whence he had been sent to preach the Word of God to the English
          nation. Afterwards he retired to a small island, which is to the
          west of Ireland, and at some distance from it, called in the
          language of the Scots, Inisboufinde,<a id="noteref_558" name="noteref_558" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_558"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">558</span></span></a> the
          Island of the White Heifer. Arriving there, he built a monastery,
          and placed in it the monks he had brought of both nations. But they
          could not agree among themselves, by reason that the Scots, in the
          summer season, when the harvest was to be brought in, leaving the
          monastery, wandered about through places known to them; but
          returned again the next winter, and desired to use in common what
          the English had provided. Colman sought to put an end to this
          dissension, and travelling about far and near, he found a place in
          the island of Ireland fitted to be the site of a monastery, which,
          in the language of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page226">[pg

          bought a small part of it of the chief to whom it belonged, to
          build his monastery thereon; upon condition, that the monks
          dwelling there should pray to the Lord for him who let them have
          the place. Then at once building a monastery, with the assistance
          of the chief and all the neighbouring people, he placed the English
          there, leaving the Scots in the aforesaid island. This monastery is
          to this day occupied by English inhabitants; being the same that,
          grown from a small beginning to be very large, is commonly called
          Muigeo; and as all have long since been brought to adopt better
          customs, it contains a notable society of monks, who are gathered
          there from the province of the English, and live by the labour of
          their own hands, after the example of the venerable fathers, under
          a rule and a canonical abbot, in much continence and singleness of

          indiction,<a id="noteref_565" name="noteref_565" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_565"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">565</span></span></a> at
          the place which is called Herutford: I, Theodore, albeit unworthy,
          appointed by the Apostolic see bishop of the church of Canterbury;
          our fellow priest and brother, the most reverend Bisi, bishop of
          the East Angles; and with <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page228">[pg

          us also our brother and fellow priest, Wilfrid, bishop of the
          nation of the Northumbrians, represented by his proxies. There were
          present also our brothers and fellow priests, Putta, bishop of the
          Kentish castle, called Rochester; Leutherius, bishop of the West
          Saxons, and Wynfrid, bishop of the province of the Mercians.<a id="noteref_566" name="noteref_566" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_566"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">566</span></span></a> When
          we were all met together, and had sat down in order, I said,
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘I beseech you, most dear brothers, for the
          fear and love of our Redeemer, that we may all treat in common on
          behalf of our faith; to the end that whatsoever has been decreed
          and defined by holy and approved fathers, may be inviolably
          observed by all of us.’</span> This and much more I spoke tending
          to charity and the preservation of the unity of the Church; and
          when I had ended my preface, I asked every one of them in order,
          whether they consented to observe the things that had been of old
          canonically decreed by the fathers? To which all our fellow priests
          answered, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Most assuredly we are all
          resolved to observe willingly and heartily whatsoever is laid down
          in the canons of the holy fathers.’</span> Then forthwith I
          produced the said book of canons,<a id="noteref_567" name="noteref_567" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_567"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">567</span></span></a> and
          in the presence of them all showed ten articles in the same, which
          I had marked in several places, because I knew them to be of the
          most importance to us, and entreated that these might be most
          particularly received by them all.</span></p>

          in which he was wont to be carried when sick, is kept by his
          disciples, and continues to cure many of fevers and other ailments;
          and not only sick persons who are laid under that litter, or close
          by it, are cured; but the very splinters cut from it, when carried

          established them both in regular discipline of the best kind. That

          ravaged all the country far and wide, it had also seized on that
          part of this monastery where the men abode, and they were daily
          hurried away to the Lord. The careful mother of the community began
          often to inquire of the sisters, when they were gathered together;
          in what part of the monastery they desired to be buried and a
          cemetery to be made, when the same affliction should fall upon that
          part of the monastery in which the handmaids of the Lord dwelt
          together apart from the men, and they should be snatched away out
          of this world by the same destruction as the rest. Receiving no
          certain answer from the sisters, though she often questioned them,
          she and all of them received a most certain answer from the Divine
          Providence. For one night, after matins had been sung, and those
          handmaids of Christ had gone out of their chapel to the tombs of
          the brothers who had departed this life before them, and were
          singing the customary songs of praise to the Lord, on a sudden a
          light from heaven, like a great sheet, came down upon them all, and
          struck them with such amazement, that, in consternation, they even
          left off singing their hymn. But that resplendent light, in
          comparison wherewith the sun at noon-day might seem dark, soon
          after, rising from that place, removed to the south side of the
          monastery, that is, to the westward of the chapel, and having
          continued there some time, and rested upon those parts, in the
          sight of them all withdrew itself again to heaven, leaving no doubt
          in the minds of all, but that the same light, which was to lead or
          to receive the souls of those handmaids of Christ into Heaven, also
          showed the place in which their bodies were to rest and await the
          day of the resurrection. The radiance of this light was so great,
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page234">[pg 234]</span><a name="Pg234" id="Pg234" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> that one of the
          older brethren, who at the same time was in their chapel with
          another younger than himself, related in the morning, that the rays
          of light which came in at the crannies of the doors and windows,
          seemed to exceed the utmost brightness of daylight.</p>

          consecrated to Christ, speaking to her by her own name, as if she
          had been present, Eadgyth! Eadgyth! Eadgyth! and thus ending his
          temporal life, entered into that which is eternal. The virgin, to
          whom he called, as he was dying, was immediately seized, where she
          was, with the same sickness, and departing this life the same day
          on which she had been summoned, followed him that called her into
          the heavenly kingdom.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Likewise, one of
          the same handmaids of God, being smitten with the same disease, and
          reduced to the last extremity, began on a sudden, about midnight,
          to cry out to them that ministered to her, desiring they would put
          out the lamp that was lighted there. And, when she had done this
          many times, and yet no one did her will, at last she said,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“I know that you think I am raving, when I
          say this, but be assured that it is not so; for I tell you truly,
          that I see this house filled with so great a light, that that lamp
          of yours seems to me to be altogether dark.”</span> And when still
          no one replied to what she said, or did her bidding, she added,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Burn your lamp, then, as long as you will;
          but know, that it is not my light, for my light will come to me at
          the dawn of day.”</span> Then <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page235">[pg 235]</span><a name="Pg235" id="Pg235" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> she began to tell, that a certain man of God,
          who had died that same year, had appeared to her, telling her that
          at the break of day she should depart to the eternal light. The
          truth of which vision was speedily proved by the maiden's death as
          soon as the day appeared.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now when
          Ethelburg herself, the pious mother of that community devoted to
          God, was about to be taken out of this world, a wonderful vision
          appeared to one of the sisters, called Tortgyth; who, having lived
          many years in that monastery, always endeavoured, in all humility
          and sincerity, to serve God herself, and to help the mother to
          maintain regular discipline, by instructing and reproving the
          younger ones. Now, in order that her virtue might, according to the
          Apostle, be made perfect in weakness, she was suddenly seized with
          a most grievous bodily disease, under which, through the merciful
          providence of our Redeemer, she was sorely tried for the space of
          nine years; to the end, that whatever stain of evil remained amidst
          her virtues, either through ignorance or neglect, might all be
          purified in the furnace of long tribulation. This woman, going out
          of the chamber where she abode one night, at dusk, plainly saw as
          it were a human body, which was brighter than the sun, wrapped in
          fine linen, and lifted up on high, being taken out of the house in
          which the sisters used to sleep. Then looking earnestly to see what
          it was that drew up that appearance of the glorious body which she
          beheld, she perceived that it was raised on high as it were by
          cords brighter than gold, until, entering into the open heavens, it
          could no longer be seen by her. Reflecting on this vision, she made
          no doubt that some one of the community would soon die, and her
          soul be lifted up to heaven by the good works which she had
          wrought, as it were by golden cords. And so in truth it befell; for
          a <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page236">[pg 236]</span><a name="Pg236" id="Pg236" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> few days after, the
          beloved of God, Ethelburg, mother of that community, was delivered
          out of the prison of the flesh; and her life is proved to have been
          such that no one who knew her ought to doubt that an entrance into
          the heavenly country was open to her, when she departed from this
          life.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There was also,
          in the same monastery, a certain nun, of noble origin in this
          world, and still nobler in the love of the world to come; who had,
          for many years, been so disabled in all her body, that she could
          not move a single limb. When she heard that the body of the
          venerable abbess had been carried into the church, till it should
          be buried, she desired to be carried thither, and to be placed
          bending towards it, after the manner of one praying; which being
          done, she spoke to her as if she had been living, and entreated her
          that she would obtain of the mercy of our pitiful Creator, that she
          might be delivered from such great and long-continued pains; nor
          was it long before her prayer was heard: for being delivered from
          the flesh twelve days after, she exchanged her temporal afflictions
          for an eternal reward.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For three years
          after the death of her Superior, the aforesaid handmaid of Christ,
          Tortgyth, was detained in this life and was so far spent with the
          sickness before mentioned, that her bones scarce held together. At
          last, when the time of her release was at hand, she not only lost
          the use of her other limbs, but also of her tongue; in which state
          having continued three days and as many nights, she was, on a
          sudden, restored by a spiritual vision, and opened her lips and
          eyes, and looking up to heaven, began thus to speak to the vision
          which she saw: <span class="tei tei-q">“Very acceptable to me is
          thy coming, and thou art welcome!”</span> Having so said, she was
          silent awhile, as it were, waiting for the answer of him whom she
          saw and to whom she spoke; then, as if somewhat displeased, she
          said, <span class="tei tei-q">“I can in no wise gladly suffer
          this;”</span> then pausing awhile, she said again, <span class="tei tei-q">“If it can by no means be to-day, I beg that the delay
          may not be long;”</span> and again holding her peace a short while,
          she concluded thus; <span class="tei tei-q">“If it is certainly so
          determined, and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page237">[pg

          the decree cannot be altered, I beg that it may be no longer
          deferred than this next night.”</span> Having so said, and being
          asked by those about her with whom she talked, she said,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“With my most dear mother,
          Ethelburg;”</span> by which they understood, that she was come to
          acquaint her that the time of her departure was at hand; for, as
          she had desired, after one day and night, she was delivered alike
          from the bonds of the flesh and of her infirmity and entered into
          the joys of eternal salvation.</p>

          the observance of regular discipline, and carefully providing all
          things for the common use. The narrowness of the space where the
          monastery is built, led her to determine that the bones of the
          servants and handmaidens of Christ, who had been there buried,
          should be taken up, and should all be translated into the church of
          the Blessed Mother of God, and interred in one place. How often a
          brightness of heavenly light was seen there, when this was done,
          and a fragrancy of wonderful sweetness arose, and what other signs
          were revealed, whosoever reads will find in the book from which we

          informs us was wrought in the cemetery of that community dedicated
          to God. There lived in that neighbourhood a certain thegn, whose
          wife was seized with a sudden dimness in her eyes, and as the
          malady increased daily, it became so burdensome to her, that she
          could not see the least glimpse of light. Having continued some
          time wrapped in the night of this blindness, on a sudden she
          bethought herself that she might recover her lost sight, if she
          were carried to the monastery of the nuns, and there prayed at the
          relics of the saints. Nor did she lose any time in fulfilling that
          which she had conceived in her mind: for being conducted by her
          maids to the monastery, which was very near, and professing that
          she had perfect faith that she should be there healed, she was led
          into the cemetery, and having long prayed there on her knees, she
          did not fail to be heard, for as she rose from prayer, before she
          went out of the place, she received the gift of sight which she had
          desired; and whereas she had been led thither by the hands of her
          maids, she now returned home joyfully without help: as if she had
          lost the light of this world to no other end than that she might
          show by her recovery how great a light is vouchsafed to the saints
          of Christ in Heaven, and how great a grace of healing power.</p>

          very devout man, of whom mention has been made above, governed the
          kingdom of the East Saxons. His mind was set on religious acts,
          frequent prayer and pious fruits of almsgiving; he esteemed a
          private and monastic life better than all the wealth and honours of
          his kingdom, and he would have long before left his kingdom and
          adopted that life, had not his wife firmly refused to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page239">[pg 239]</span><a name="Pg239" id="Pg239" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> be divorced from him; for which reason
          many were of opinion and often said that a man of such a
          disposition ought rather to have been made a bishop than a king.
          When he had spent thirty years as a king and a soldier of the
          heavenly kingdom, he fell into great bodily infirmity, of which he
          afterwards died, and he admonished his wife, that they should then
          at least together devote themselves to the service of God, since
          they could no longer together enjoy, or rather serve, the world.
          Having with much difficulty obtained this of her, he went to
          Waldhere, bishop of London, who had succeeded Earconwald,<a id="noteref_588" name="noteref_588" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_588"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">588</span></span></a> and
          with his blessing received the religious habit, which he had long
          desired. He also carried to him a considerable sum of money, to be
          given to the poor, reserving nothing to himself, but rather
          coveting to remain poor in spirit for the sake of the kingdom of
          Heaven.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the
          aforesaid sickness increased, and he perceived the day of his death
          to be drawing near, being a man of a royal disposition, he began to
          apprehend lest, when in great pain, at the approach of death, he
          might commit anything unworthy of his character, either by word or
          gesture. Wherefore, calling to him the aforesaid bishop of London,
          in which city he then was, he entreated him that none might be
          present at his death, besides the bishop himself, and two of his
          own attendants. The bishop having promised that he would most
          willingly grant his request, not long after the man of God composed
          himself to sleep, and saw a consoling vision, which took from him
          all anxiety concerning the aforesaid uneasiness; and, moreover,
          showed him on what day he was to end his life. For, as he
          afterwards related, he saw three men in shining garments come to
          him; one of whom sat down by his bed, whilst his companions who had
          come with him stood and inquired <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page240">[pg 240]</span><a name="Pg240" id="Pg240" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> about the state of the sick man they had come
          to visit, and he said that the king's soul should quit his body
          without any pain, and with a great splendour of light; and told him
          that he should die the third day after. Both these things came to
          pass, as he had learnt from the vision; for on the third day after,
          at the ninth hour, he suddenly fell, as it were, into a light
          slumber, and without any sense of pain he gave up the ghost.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A stone coffin
          had been prepared for his burial, but when they came to lay him in
          it, they found his body a span longer than the coffin. Hereupon
          they chipped away as much of the stone as they could, and made the
          coffin about two inches longer; but not even so would it contain
          the body. Wherefore because of this difficulty of entombing him,
          they had thoughts either to get another coffin, or else to shorten
          the body, by bending it at the knees, if they could, so that the
          coffin might contain it. But Heaven interposed and a miracle
          prevented the execution of either of those designs; for on a
          sudden, in the presence of the bishop and Sighard, who was the son
          of that same king and monk, and who reigned after him jointly with
          his brother Suefred,<a id="noteref_589" name="noteref_589" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_589"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">589</span></span></a> and
          of no small number of men, that coffin was found to fit the length
          of the body, insomuch that a pillow might even be put in at the
          head; and at the feet the coffin was four inches longer than the
          body. He was buried in the church of the blessed teacher of the
          Gentiles,<a id="noteref_590" name="noteref_590" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_590"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">590</span></span></a> by

          and the Baptism of salvation. Ethelwalch,<a id="noteref_616" name="noteref_616" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_616"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">616</span></span></a> king

          was present, and received him as his godson when he came forth from

          own country, the province of the Hwiccas.<a id="noteref_620" name="noteref_620" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_620"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">620</span></span></a> She

          were both Christians, as were their people; but all the province of
          the South Saxons was ignorant of the Name of God and the faith. But
          there was among them a certain monk of the Scottish nation, whose
          name was Dicul,<a id="noteref_622" name="noteref_622" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_622"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">622</span></span></a> who
          had a very small monastery, at the place called Bosanhamm,<a id="noteref_623" name="noteref_623" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_623"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">623</span></span></a>
          encompassed by woods and seas, and in it there were five or six
          brothers, who served the Lord in humility and poverty; but none of
          the natives cared either to follow their course of life, or hear
          their preaching.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But Bishop
          Wilfrid, while preaching the Gospel to the people, not only
          delivered them from the misery of eternal damnation, but also from
          a terrible calamity of temporal death. For no rain had fallen in
          that district for three years before his arrival in the province,
          whereupon a grievous famine fell upon the people and pitilessly
          destroyed them; insomuch that it is said that often forty or fifty
          men, wasted with hunger, would go together to some precipice, or to
          the sea-shore, and there, hand in hand, in piteous wise cast them
          themselves down either to perish by the fall, or be swallowed up by
          the waves. But on the very day on which the nation received the
          Baptism of the faith, there fell a soft but plentiful rain; the
          earth revived, the fields grew green again, and the season was
          pleasant and fruitful. Thus the old superstition was cast away, and
          idolatry renounced, the heart and flesh of all rejoiced in the
          living God, for they perceived that He Who is the true God had
          enriched them by His heavenly grace with both inward and outward
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page247">[pg 247]</span><a name="Pg247" id="Pg247" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> blessings. For the
          bishop, when he came into the province, and found so great misery
          from famine there, taught them to get their food by fishing; for
          their sea and rivers abounded in fish, but the people had no skill
          to take any of them, except eels alone. The bishop's men having
          gathered eel-nets everywhere, cast them into the sea, and by the
          blessing of God took three hundred fishes of divers sorts, which
          being divided into three parts, they gave a hundred to the poor, a
          hundred to those of whom they had the nets, and kept a hundred for
          their own use. By this benefit the bishop gained the affections of
          them all, and they began more readily at his preaching to hope for
          heavenly blessings, seeing that by his help they had received those
          which are temporal.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At this time,
          King Ethelwalch gave to the most reverend prelate, Wilfrid, land to
          the extent of eighty-seven families, to maintain his company who
          were wandering in exile. The place is called Selaeseu,<a id="noteref_624" name="noteref_624" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_624"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">624</span></span></a> that
          is, the Island of the Sea-Calf; it is encompassed by the sea on all
          sides, except the west, where is an entrance about the cast of a
          sling in width; which sort of place is by the Latins called a
          peninsula, by the Greeks, a cherronesos. Bishop Wilfrid, having
          this place given him, founded therein a monastery, chiefly of the
          brethren he had brought with him, and established a rule of life;
          and his successors are known to be there to this day. He himself,
          both in word and deed performed the duties of a bishop in those
          parts during the space of five years, until the death of King
          Egfrid,<a id="noteref_625" name="noteref_625" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_625"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">625</span></span></a> and
          was justly honoured by all. And forasmuch as the king, together
          with the said place, gave him all the goods that were therein, with
          the lands and men, he instructed all the people in <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page248">[pg 248]</span><a name="Pg248" id="Pg248" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the faith of Christ, and cleansed them
          in the water of Baptism. Among whom were two hundred and fifty
          bondsmen and bondswomen, all of whom he saved by Baptism from
          slavery to the Devil, and in like manner, by giving them their
          liberty, set them free from slavery to man.</p>

          most creditable brothers of the same monastery. About the same time
          that this province had received the faith of Christ, a grievous
          pestilence fell upon many provinces of Britain; which, also, by the
          Divine dispensation, reached to the aforesaid monastery, then

          humbly to implore the Divine goodness to vouchsafe to have mercy on
          them, either by delivering from instant death those that were in
          danger by reason of the disease, or by saving those who were
          hurried out of this life from the eternal damnation of their
          souls.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There was at
          that time in the monastery, a little boy, of the Saxon nation,
          lately called to the faith, who had been attacked by the same
          infirmity, and had long kept his bed. On the second day of the
          aforesaid fasting and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page249">[pg
          249]</span><a name="Pg249" id="Pg249" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          prayer, it happened about the second hour of the day, that this boy
          was left alone in the place where he lay sick, when on a sudden,
          through the Divine disposition, the most blessed chiefs of the
          Apostles vouchsafed to appear to him; for he was a boy of a very
          simple and gentle disposition, and with sincere devotion observed
          the mysteries of the faith which he had received. The Apostles
          therefore, greeting him with loving words, said, <span class="tei tei-q">“My son, fear not death, concerning which thou art
          troubled; for this day we will bring thee to the kingdom of Heaven;
          but first thou must needs wait till the Masses are celebrated, that
          having received thy voyage provision,<a id="noteref_628" name="noteref_628" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_628"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">628</span></span></a> the
          Body and Blood of our Lord, and so being set free from sickness and
          death, thou mayest be taken up to the everlasting joys in
          Heaven.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Call therefore to thee the priest, Eappa, and tell
          him, that the Lord has heard your prayers, and has favourably
          looked upon your devotion and your fast, and not one more shall die
          of this plague, either in the monastery or the lands adjacent to
          it; but all your people who any where labour under this sickness,
          shall be raised up from their weakness, and restored to their
          former health, saving thee alone, who art this day to be delivered
          from death, and to be carried into Heaven, to behold our Lord
          Christ, whom thou hast faithfully served. This favour the Divine
          mercy has vouchsafed to grant you, through the intercession of the
          godly King Oswald, beloved of God, who formerly nobly ruled over
          the nation of the Northumbrians, with the authority of a temporal
          kingdom and the devotion of Christian piety which leads to the
          eternal kingdom. For this very day that king was killed in body by
          the infidels in war, and straightway taken up to Heaven to the
          everlasting joys of souls, and brought into fellowship with the
          number of the elect. Let them look in their records,<a id="noteref_629" name="noteref_629" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_629"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">629</span></span></a>
          wherein the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page250">[pg
          250]</span><a name="Pg250" id="Pg250" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          burial of the dead is set down, and they will find that he was,
          this day, as we have said, taken out of this world. Let them,
          therefore, celebrate Masses in all the oratories of this monastery,
          either in thanksgiving because their prayers are heard, or else in
          memory of the aforesaid King Oswald, who once governed their
          nation,<a id="noteref_630" name="noteref_630" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_630"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">630</span></span></a> and
          therefore humbly prayed to the Lord for them, as for converts of
          his nation; and let all the brethren assemble in the church, and
          all communicate in the heavenly Sacrifices, and so let them cease
          to fast, and refresh the body also with the food that belongs to
          it.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The boy called
          the priest, and repeated all these words to him; and the priest
          carefully inquired after the habit and form of the men that had
          appeared to him. He answered, <span class="tei tei-q">“Their habit
          was altogether noble, and their countenances most pleasant and
          beautiful, such as I had never seen before, nor did I think there
          could be any men so fair and comely. One of them indeed was shorn
          like a clerk, the other had a long beard; and they said that one of
          them was called Peter, the other Paul; and they were the servants
          of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, sent by Him from Heaven to
          protect our monastery.”</span> The priest believed what the boy
          said, and going thence immediately, looked in his chronicle, and
          found that King Oswald had been killed on that very day. He then
          called the brethren, ordered dinner to be provided, Masses to be
          said, and all of them to communicate as usual; causing also a part
          of the same Sacrifice of the Lord's Oblation to be carried to the
          sick boy.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Soon after this,
          the boy died, on that same day; and by his death proved that the
          words which he had heard from the Apostles of Christ were true. And
          this moreover bore witness to the truth of his words, that none
          besides himself, belonging to the same monastery, was taken away at
          that time. And without doubt, by this vision, many that heard of it
          were wonderfully excited <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page251">[pg
          251]</span><a name="Pg251" id="Pg251" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          to implore the Divine mercy in adversity, and to submit to the
          wholesome remedy of fasting. From that time, the day of
          commemoration of that king and soldier of Christ began to be yearly
          honoured with the celebration of Masses, not only in that
          monastery, but in many other places.</p>

          wasted that province with cruel slaughter and devastation; but he
          was soon expelled by Berthun and Andhun, the king's ealdormen, who

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After Caedwalla
          had obtained possession of the kingdom of the Gewissae, he took
          also the Isle of Wight, which till then was entirely given over to
          idolatry, and by merciless slaughter endeavoured to destroy all the
          inhabitants thereof, and to place in their stead people from his
          own province; binding himself by a vow, though it is said that he
          was not yet regenerated in Christ, to give the fourth part of the
          land and of the spoil to the Lord, if he took the island. He
          fulfilled this vow by giving the same for the service of the Lord
          to Bishop Wilfrid, who happened at the time to have come thither
          from his own people.<a id="noteref_636" name="noteref_636" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_636"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">636</span></span></a> The
          measure of that island, according to the computation of the
          English, is of twelve hundred families, wherefore an estate of
          three hundred families was given to the Bishop. The part which he
          received, he committed to one of his clerks called Bernwin, who was
          his sister's son, assigning to him a priest, whose name was
          Hiddila, to administer the Word and laver of life to all that would
          be saved.</p>

          crowned with the special grace of God. For when the enemy

          is, the Ford of Reeds, he came to the king, who then lay in
          concealment in those parts to be cured of the wounds which he had
          received whilst he was fighting in the Isle of Wight, and begged of
          him, that if the boys must needs be killed, he might be allowed
          first to instruct them in the mysteries of the Christian faith. The
          king consented, and the bishop having taught them the Word of
          truth, and cleansed them in the font of salvation, assured to them
          their entrance into the kingdom of Heaven. Then the executioner
          came, and they joyfully underwent the temporal death, through which
          they did not doubt they were to pass to the life of the soul, which
          is everlasting. Thus, after this manner, when all the provinces of
          Britain had received the faith of Christ, the Isle of Wight also
          received the same; yet because it was suffering under the
          affliction of foreign subjection, no man there received the office
          or see of a bishop, before Daniel, who is now bishop of the West
          Saxons.<a id="noteref_641" name="noteref_641" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_641"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">641</span></span></a></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The island is
          situated opposite the borders of the South Saxons and the Gewissae,

          this sea, the two tides of the ocean, which break upon Britain all
          round its coasts from the boundless northern ocean, daily meet in

          runs into the aforesaid sea, through the lands of the Jutes,

          abbot of the monastery of the blessed Martin, who had come lately
          from Rome, by order of Pope Agatho, together with the most reverend
          Abbot Biscop, surnamed Benedict,<a id="noteref_654" name="noteref_654" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_654"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">654</span></span></a> of
          whom mention has been made above. For the said Benedict, having
          built a monastery in Britain, in honour of the most blessed chief
          of the Apostles, at the mouth of the river Wear, went to Rome with
          Ceolfrid,<a id="noteref_655" name="noteref_655" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_655"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">655</span></span></a> his
          companion and fellow-labourer in that work, who was after him abbot
          of the same monastery; he had been several times before at Rome,
          and was now honourably received by Pope Agatho of blessed memory;
          from whom he also asked and obtained, in order to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page258">[pg 258]</span><a name="Pg258" id="Pg258" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> secure the immunities of the monastery
          which he had founded, a letter of privilege confirmed by apostolic
          authority, according to what he knew to be the will and grant of
          King Egfrid, by whose consent and gift of land he had built that
          monastery.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He was also
          allowed to take the aforesaid Abbot John with him into Britain,
          that he might teach in his monastery the system of singing
          throughout the year, as it was practised at St. Peter's at
          Rome.<a id="noteref_656" name="noteref_656" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_656"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">656</span></span></a> The
          Abbot John did as he had been commanded by the Pope, teaching the
          singers of the said monastery the order and manner of singing and
          reading aloud, and committing to writing all that was requisite
          throughout the whole course of the year for the celebration of
          festivals; and these writings are still preserved in that
          monastery, and have been copied by many others elsewhere. The said
          John not only taught the brothers of that monastery, but such as
          had skill in singing resorted from almost all the monasteries of
          the same province to hear him, and many invited him to teach in
          other places.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Besides his task
          of singing and reading, he had also received a commission from the
          Apostolic Pope, carefully to inform himself concerning the faith of
          the English Church, and to give an account thereof on his return to
          Rome. For he also brought with him the decision of the synod of the
          blessed Pope Martin, held not long before at Rome,<a id="noteref_657" name="noteref_657" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_657"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">657</span></span></a> with
          the consent of one hundred and five bishops, chiefly to refute
          those who taught that there is but one operation and will in
          Christ, and he gave it to be transcribed in the aforesaid monastery
          of the most religious Abbot Benedict. The men who followed such
          opinion greatly perplexed the faith of the Church of Constantinople
          at that time; but by the help of God they were then discovered and
          overcome.<a id="noteref_658" name="noteref_658" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_658"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">658</span></span></a>
          Wherefore, Pope Agatho, being desirous to be informed concerning
          the state of the Church in Britain, as well as in other provinces,
          and to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page259">[pg
          259]</span><a name="Pg259" id="Pg259" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          what extent it was clear from the contagion of heretics, gave this
          matter in charge to the most reverend Abbot John, then appointed to
          go to Britain. The synod we have spoken of having been called for
          this purpose in Britain, the Catholic faith was found untainted in
          all, and a report of the proceedings of the same was given him to
          carry to Rome.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But in his
          return to his own country, soon after crossing the sea, he fell
          sick and died; and his body, for the sake of St. Martin, in whose
          monastery he presided, was by his friends carried to Tours,<a id="noteref_659" name="noteref_659" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_659"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">659</span></span></a> and
          honourably buried; for he had been kindly entertained by the Church
          there on his way to Britain, and earnestly entreated by the
          brethren, that in his return to Rome he would take that road, and
          visit their Church, and moreover he was there supplied with men to
          conduct him on his way, and assist him in the work enjoined upon
          him. Though he died by the way, yet the testimony of the Catholic
          faith of the English nation was carried to Rome, and received with
          great joy by the Apostolic Pope, and all those that heard or read
          it.</p>

          the Southern Gyrwas; but he died soon after he had married her, and
          she was given to the aforesaid king. Though she lived with him
          twelve years, yet she preserved the glory of perfect virginity, as
          I was informed by Bishop <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page260">[pg
          260]</span><a name="Pg260" id="Pg260" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          Wilfrid, of blessed memory, of whom I inquired, because some
          questioned the truth thereof; and he told me that he was an
          undoubted witness to her virginity, forasmuch as Egfrid promised to
          give him many lands and much money if he could persuade the queen
          to consent to fulfil her marriage duty, for he knew the queen loved
          no man more than himself. And it is not to be doubted that this
          might take place in our age, which true histories tell us happened
          sometimes in former ages, by the help of the same Lord who promises
          to abide with us always, even unto the end of the world. For the
          divine miracle whereby her flesh, being buried, could not suffer
          corruption, is a token that she had not been defiled by man.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She had long
          asked of the king that he would permit her to lay aside worldly
          cares, and to serve only Christ, the true King, in a monastery; and
          having at length with difficulty prevailed, she entered the
          monastery of the Abbess Aebba,<a id="noteref_662" name="noteref_662" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_662"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">662</span></span></a> who
          was aunt to King Egfrid, at the place called the city of

          having received the veil of the religious habit from the hands of
          the aforesaid Bishop Wilfrid; but a year after she was herself made
          abbess in the district called Elge,<a id="noteref_664" name="noteref_664" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_664"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">664</span></span></a>
          where, having built a monastery, she began, by the example of a
          heavenly life and by her teaching, to be the virgin mother of many
          virgins dedicated to God. It is told of her that from the time of
          her entering the monastery, she would never wear any linen but only
          woollen garments, and would <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page261">[pg 261]</span><a name="Pg261" id="Pg261" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> seldom wash in a hot bath, unless just before
          the greater festivals, as Easter, Whitsuntide, and the Epiphany,
          and then she did it last of all, when the other handmaids of Christ
          who were there had been washed, served by her and her attendants.
          She seldom ate more than once a day, excepting on the greater
          festivals, or some urgent occasion. Always, except when grievous
          sickness prevented her, from the time of matins till day-break, she
          continued in the church at prayer. Some also say, that by the
          spirit of prophecy she not only foretold the pestilence of which
          she was to die, but also, in the presence of all, revealed the
          number of those that should be then snatched away from this world
          out of her monastery. She was taken to the Lord, in the midst of
          her flock, seven years after she had been made abbess; and, as she
          had ordered, was buried among them in a wooden coffin in her turn,
          according to the order in which she had passed away.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She was
          succeeded in the office of abbess by her sister Sexburg,<a id="noteref_665" name="noteref_665" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_665"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">665</span></span></a> who
          had been wife to Earconbert, king of Kent. This abbess, when her
          sister had been buried sixteen years, thought fit to take up her
          bones, and, putting them into a new coffin, to translate them into
          the church. Accordingly she ordered some of the brothers to find a
          stone whereof to make a coffin for this purpose. They went on board
          ship, for the district of Ely is on every side encompassed with
          water and marshes, and has no large stones, and came to a small
          deserted city, not far from thence, which, in the language of the
          English, is called Grantacaestir,<a id="noteref_666" name="noteref_666" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_666"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">666</span></span></a> and
          presently, near the city walls, they found a white marble
          coffin,<a id="noteref_667" name="noteref_667" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_667"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">667</span></span></a> most

          wrought, and fitly covered with a lid of the same sort of stone.
          Perceiving, therefore, that the Lord had prospered their journey,
          they returned thanks to Him and carried it to the monastery.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the grave
          was opened and the body of the holy virgin and bride of Christ was
          brought into the light of day, it was found as free from corruption
          as if she had died and been buried on that very day; as the
          aforesaid Bishop Wilfrid, and many others that know it, testify.
          But the physician, Cynifrid, who was present at her death, and when
          she was taken up out of the grave, had more certain knowledge. He
          was wont to relate that in her sickness she had a very great tumour
          under her jaw. <span class="tei tei-q">“And I was ordered,”</span>
          said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“to lay open that tumour to let
          out the noxious matter in it, which I did, and she seemed to be
          somewhat more easy for two days, so that many thought she might
          recover from her infirmity; but on the third day she was attacked
          by the former pains, and being soon snatched out of the world, she
          exchanged all pain and death for everlasting life and health. And
          when, so many years after, her bones were to be taken out of the
          grave, a pavilion being spread over it, and all the congregation,
          the brothers on the one side, and the sisters on the other,
          standing about it singing, while the abbess, with a few others, had
          gone within to take up and wash the bones, on a sudden we heard the
          abbess within cry out with a loud voice, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Glory be to the name of the Lord.’</span> Not long
          after they called me in, opening the door of the pavilion, and I
          found the body of the holy virgin taken out of the grave and laid
          on a bed, like one asleep; then taking off the veil from the face,
          they also showed me that the incision which I had made was healed
          up; so that, in marvellous wise, instead of the open gaping wound
          with which she had been buried, there then appeared only the
          slightest trace of a scar. Besides, all the linen clothes in which
          the body had been wrapped, appeared entire and as fresh as if they
          had been that very day put about her chaste limbs.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is said that
          when she was sore troubled with the aforesaid tumour and pain in
          her jaw and neck, she took great <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page263">[pg 263]</span><a name="Pg263" id="Pg263" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> pleasure in that sort of sickness, and was
          wont to say, <span class="tei tei-q">“I know of a surety that I
          deservedly bear the weight of my trouble on my neck, for I remember
          that, when I was a young maiden, I bore on it the needless weight
          of necklaces;<a id="noteref_668" name="noteref_668" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_668"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">668</span></span></a> and
          therefore I believe the Divine goodness would have me endure the
          pain in my neck, that so I may be absolved from the guilt of my
          needless levity, having now, instead of gold and pearls, the fiery
          heat of a tumour rising on my neck.”</span> It happened also that
          by the touch of those same linen clothes devils were expelled from
          bodies possessed, and other diseases were at divers times healed;
          and the coffin wherein she was first buried is said to have cured
          some of infirmities of the eyes, who, praying with their heads
          resting upon that coffin, were presently relieved of the pain or
          dimness in their eyes. So they washed the virgin's body, and having
          clothed it in new garments, brought it into the church, and laid it
          in the sarcophagus that had been brought, where it is held in great
          veneration to this day. The sarcophagus was found in a wonderful
          manner to fit the virgin's body as if it had been made purposely
          for her, and the place for the head, which was fashioned
          separately, appeared exactly shaped to the measurement of her
          head.</p>

          the great plenty of eels taken in those marshes; there the

          which I think ought by no means to be passed over in silence; for
          the story will be profitable to the salvation of many. In that
          battle a youth called Imma, one of the king's thegns, was struck
          down, and having lain as if dead all that day and the next night
          among the bodies of the slain, at length he came to himself and
          revived, and sitting up, bound his own wounds as best as he could.
          Then having rested awhile, he stood up, and went away to see if he
          could find any friends to take care of him; but in so doing he was
          discovered and taken by some of the enemy's army, and carried
          before their lord, who was one of King Ethelred's nobles.<a id="noteref_678" name="noteref_678" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_678"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">678</span></span></a> Being
          asked by him who he was, and fearing to own himself a thegn, he
          answered that he was a peasant, a poor man and married, and he
          declared that he had come to the war with others like himself to
          bring provisions to the army. The noble entertained him, and
          ordered his wounds to be dressed, and when he began to recover, to
          prevent his escaping, he ordered him to be bound at night. But he
          could not be bound, for as soon as they that bound him were gone,
          his bonds were loosed.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now he had a
          brother called Tunna, who was a priest and abbot of a monastery in
          the city which is still called Tunnacaestir after him.<a id="noteref_679" name="noteref_679" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_679"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">679</span></span></a> This
          man, hearing that his brother had been killed in the battle, went
          to see if haply he could find his body; and finding another very
          like him in all respects, he believed it to be his. So he carried
          it to his monastery, and buried it honourably, and took care often
          to say Masses for the absolution of his soul; the celebration
          whereof occasioned what I have said, that none could bind him but
          he was presently loosed again. In the meantime, the noble that had
          kept him was amazed, and began to inquire why he could not be
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page269">[pg 269]</span><a name="Pg269" id="Pg269" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> bound; whether
          perchance he had any spells about him, such as are spoken of in
          stories. He answered that he knew nothing of those arts;
          <span class="tei tei-q">“but I have,”</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“a brother who is a priest in my country, and I know
          that he, supposing me to be killed, is saying frequent Masses for
          me; and if I were now in the other life, my soul there, through his
          intercession, would be delivered from penalty.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When he had been
          a prisoner with the noble some time, those who attentively observed
          him, by his countenance, habit, and discourse, took notice, that he
          was not of the meaner sort, as he had said, but of some quality.
          The noble then privately sending for him, straitly questioned him,
          whence he came, promising to do him no harm on that account if he
          would frankly confess who he was. This he did, declaring that he
          had been a thegn of the king's, and the noble answered,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“I perceived by all your answers that you
          were no peasant. And now you deserve to die, because all my
          brothers and relations were killed in that fight; yet I will not
          put you to death, that I may not break my promise.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As soon,
          therefore, as he was recovered, he sold him to a certain Frisian at
          London, but he could not in any wise be bound either by him, or as
          he was being led thither. But when his enemies had put all manner
          of bonds on him, and the buyer perceived that he could in no way be
          bound, he gave him leave to ransom himself if he could. Now it was
          at the third hour, when the Masses were wont to be said, that his
          bonds were most frequently loosed. He, having taken an oath that he
          would either return, or send his owner the money for the ransom,
          went into Kent to King Hlothere, who was son to the sister of Queen
          Ethelthryth,<a id="noteref_680" name="noteref_680" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_680"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">680</span></span></a> above
          spoken of, for he had once been that queen's thegn. From him he
          asked and obtained the price of his freedom, and as he had
          promised, sent it to his master for his ransom.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Returning
          afterwards into his own country, and coming to his brother, he gave
          him an exact account of all his <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page270">[pg 270]</span><a name="Pg270" id="Pg270" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> misfortunes, and the consolation afforded to
          him in them; and from what his brother told him he understood, that
          his bonds had been generally loosed at those times when Masses had
          been celebrated for him; and he perceived that other advantages and
          blessings which had fallen to his lot in his time of danger, had
          been conferred on him from Heaven, through the intercession of his
          brother, and the Oblation of the saving Sacrifice. Many, on hearing
          this account from the aforesaid man, were stirred up in faith and
          pious devotion to prayer, or to alms-giving, or to make an offering
          to God of the Sacrifice of the holy Oblation, for the deliverance
          of their friends who had departed this world; for they knew that
          such saving Sacrifice availed for the eternal redemption both of
          body and soul. This story was also told me by some of those who had
          heard it related by the man himself to whom it happened; therefore,
          since I had a clear understanding of it, I have not hesitated to
          insert it in my Ecclesiastical History.</p>

          mentioned above, after having done many heavenly deeds on earth,
          passed thence to receive the rewards of the heavenly life, on the
          17th of November, at the age of sixty-six years. Her life falls
          into two equal parts, for the first thirty-three years of it she
          spent living most nobly in the secular habit; and still more nobly
          dedicated the remaining half to the Lord in the monastic life. For
          she was nobly born, being the daughter of Hereric,<a id="noteref_683" name="noteref_683" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_683"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">683</span></span></a>
          nephew to King Edwin, and with that king she also received
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page271">[pg 271]</span><a name="Pg271" id="Pg271" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the faith and

          memory,<a id="noteref_684" name="noteref_684" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_684"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">684</span></span></a> the
          first bishop of the Northumbrians, and preserved the same undefiled
          till she attained to the vision of our Lord in Heaven.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When she had
          resolved to quit the secular habit, and to serve Him alone, she
          withdrew into the province of the East Angles, for she was allied
          to the king there;<a id="noteref_685" name="noteref_685" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_685"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">685</span></span></a> being
          desirous to cross over thence into Gaul, forsaking her native
          country and all that she had, and so to live a stranger for our
          Lord's sake in the monastery of Cale,<a id="noteref_686" name="noteref_686" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_686"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">686</span></span></a> that
          she might the better attain to the eternal country in heaven. For
          her sister Heresuid, mother to Aldwulf,<a id="noteref_687" name="noteref_687" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_687"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">687</span></span></a> king
          of the East Angles, was at that time living in the same monastery,
          under regular discipline, waiting for an everlasting crown; and led
          by her example, she continued a whole year in the aforesaid
          province, with the design of going abroad; but afterwards, Bishop
          Aidan recalled her to her home, and she received land to the extent
          of one family on the north side of the river Wear;<a id="noteref_688" name="noteref_688" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_688"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">688</span></span></a> where
          likewise for a year she led a monastic life, with very few
          companions.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After this she
          was made abbess in the monastery called Heruteu,<a id="noteref_689" name="noteref_689" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_689"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">689</span></span></a> which
          monastery had been founded, not long before, by the pious handmaid
          of Christ, Heiu,<a id="noteref_690" name="noteref_690" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_690"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">690</span></span></a> who
          is said to have been the first woman in the province of the
          Northumbrians who took upon her the vows and habit of a nun, being
          consecrated by Bishop Aidan; but she, soon after she had founded
          that monastery, retired to the city of Calcaria,<a id="noteref_691" name="noteref_691" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_691"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">691</span></span></a> which
          is called Kaelcacaestir <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page272">[pg
          272]</span><a name="Pg272" id="Pg272" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          by the English, and there fixed her dwelling. Hilda, the handmaid
          of Christ, being set over that monastery, began immediately to
          order it in all things under a rule of life, according as she had
          been instructed by learned men; for Bishop Aidan, and others of the
          religious that knew her, frequently visited her and loved her
          heartily, and diligently instructed her, because of her innate
          wisdom and love of the service of God.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When she had for
          some years governed this monastery, wholly intent upon establishing
          a rule of life, it happened that she also undertook either to build
          or to set in order a monastery in the place called Streanaeshalch,
          and this work which was laid upon her she industriously performed;
          for she put this monastery under the same rule of monastic life as
          the former; and taught there the strict observance of justice,
          piety, chastity, and other virtues, and particularly of peace and
          charity; so that, after the example of the primitive Church, no one
          there was rich, and none poor, for they had all things common, and
          none had any private property. Her prudence was so great, that not
          only meaner men in their need, but sometimes even kings and
          princes, sought and received her counsel; she obliged those who
          were under her direction to give so much time to reading of the
          Holy Scriptures, and to exercise themselves so much in works of
          justice, that many might readily be found there fit for the
          priesthood and the service of the altar.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Indeed we have
          seen five from that monastery who afterwards became bishops, and
          all of them men of singular merit and sanctity, whose names were
          Bosa,<a id="noteref_692" name="noteref_692" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_692"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">692</span></span></a>

          the first we have said above that he was consecrated bishop of
          York; of the second, it may be briefly stated that he was appointed
          bishop of Dorchester. Of the last two we shall tell hereafter, that
          the former was ordained bishop of Hagustald, the other of the
          church of York; of the third, we may here mention that, having
          applied himself to the reading and observance of the Scriptures in
          both the monasteries of the Abbess Hilda,<a id="noteref_697" name="noteref_697" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_697"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">697</span></span></a> at
          length being desirous to attain to greater perfection, he went into
          Kent, to Archbishop Theodore, of blessed memory; where having spent
          some time in sacred studies, he resolved to go to Rome also, which,
          in those days, was esteemed a very salutary undertaking. Returning
          thence into Britain, he took his way into the province of the
          Hwiccas,<a id="noteref_698" name="noteref_698" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_698"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">698</span></span></a> where
          King Osric then ruled,<a id="noteref_699" name="noteref_699" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_699"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">699</span></span></a> and
          continued there a long time, preaching the Word of faith, and
          showing an example of good life to all that saw and heard him. At
          that time, Bosel, the bishop of that province,<a id="noteref_700" name="noteref_700" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_700"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">700</span></span></a>
          laboured under <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page274">[pg
          274]</span><a name="Pg274" id="Pg274" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          such weakness of body, that he could not himself perform episcopal
          functions; for which reason, Oftfor was, by universal consent,
          chosen bishop in his stead, and by order of King Ethelred,<a id="noteref_701" name="noteref_701" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_701"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">701</span></span></a>
          consecrated by Bishop Wilfrid,<a id="noteref_702" name="noteref_702" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_702"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">702</span></span></a> of
          blessed memory, who was then Bishop of the Midland Angles, because
          Archbishop Theodore was dead, and no other bishop ordained in his
          place. A little while before, that is, before the election of the
          aforesaid man of God, Bosel, Tatfrid,<a id="noteref_703" name="noteref_703" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_703"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">703</span></span></a> a man
          of great industry and learning, and of excellent ability, had been
          chosen bishop for that province, from the monastery of the same
          abbess, but had been snatched away by an untimely death, before he
          could be ordained.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus this
          handmaid of Christ, the Abbess Hilda, whom all that knew her called
          Mother, for her singular piety and grace, was not only an example
          of good life, to those that lived in her monastery, but afforded
          occasion of amendment and salvation to many who lived at a
          distance, to whom the blessed fame was brought of her industry and
          virtue. For it was meet that the dream of her mother, Bregusuid,
          during her infancy, should be fulfilled. Now Bregusuid, at the time
          that her husband, Hereric, lived in banishment, under Cerdic,<a id="noteref_704" name="noteref_704" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_704"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">704</span></span></a> king
          of the Britons, where he was also poisoned, fancied, in a dream,
          that he was suddenly taken away from her and she was seeking for
          him most carefully, but could find no sign of him anywhere. After
          an anxious search for him, all at once she found a most precious
          necklace under her garment, and whilst she was looking on it very
          attentively, it seemed to shine forth with such a blaze of light
          that it filled all Britain with the glory of its brilliance. This
          dream was doubtless fulfilled in her daughter that <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page275">[pg 275]</span><a name="Pg275" id="Pg275" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> we speak of, whose life was an example
          of the works of light, not only blessed to herself, but to many who
          desired to live aright.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When she had
          governed this monastery many years, it pleased Him Who has made
          such merciful provision for our salvation, to give her holy soul
          the trial of a long infirmity of the flesh, to the end that,
          according to the Apostle's example, her virtue might be made
          perfect in weakness. Struck down with a fever, she suffered from a
          burning heat, and was afflicted with the same trouble for six years
          continually; during all which time she never failed either to
          return thanks to her Maker, or publicly and privately to instruct
          the flock committed to her charge; for taught by her own experience
          she admonished all men to serve the Lord dutifully, when health of
          body is granted to them, and always to return thanks faithfully to
          Him in adversity, or bodily infirmity. In the seventh year of her
          sickness, when the disease turned inwards, her last day came, and
          about cockcrow, having received the voyage provision<a id="noteref_705" name="noteref_705" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_705"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">705</span></span></a> of
          Holy Housel, and called together the handmaids of Christ that were
          within the same monastery, she admonished them to preserve the
          peace of the Gospel among themselves, and with all others; and even
          as she spoke her words of exhortation, she joyfully saw death come,
          or, in the words of our Lord, passed from death unto life.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That same night
          it pleased Almighty God, by a manifest vision, to make known her
          death in another monastery, at a distance from hers, which she had
          built that same year, and which is called Hacanos.<a id="noteref_706" name="noteref_706" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_706"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">706</span></span></a> There
          was in that monastery, a certain nun called Begu,<a id="noteref_707" name="noteref_707" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_707"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">707</span></span></a> who,
          having dedicated her virginity to the Lord, had served Him upwards
          of thirty years in the monastic life. This nun was resting
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page276">[pg 276]</span><a name="Pg276" id="Pg276" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> in the dormitory of
          the sisters, when on a sudden she heard in the air the well-known
          sound of the bell, which used to awake and call them to prayers,
          when any one of them was taken out of this world, and opening her
          eyes, as she thought, she saw the roof of the house open, and a
          light shed from above filling all the place. Looking earnestly upon
          that light, she saw the soul of the aforesaid handmaid of God in
          that same light, being carried to heaven attended and guided by
          angels. Then awaking, and seeing the other sisters lying round
          about her, she perceived that what she had seen had been revealed
          to her either in a dream or a vision; and rising immediately in
          great fear, she ran to the virgin who then presided in the
          monastery in the place of the abbess,<a id="noteref_708" name="noteref_708" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_708"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">708</span></span></a> and
          whose name was Frigyth, and, with many tears and lamentations, and
          heaving deep sighs, told her that the Abbess Hilda, mother of them
          all, had departed this life, and had in her sight ascended to the
          gates of eternal light, and to the company of the citizens of
          heaven, with a great light, and with angels for her guides. Frigyth
          having heard it, awoke all the sisters, and calling them to the
          church, admonished them to give themselves to prayer and singing of
          psalms, for the soul of their mother; which they did earnestly
          during the remainder of the night; and at break of day, the
          brothers came with news of her death, from the place where she had
          died. They answered that they knew it before, and then related in
          order how and when they had learnt it, by which it appeared that
          her death had been revealed to them in a vision that same hour in
          which the brothers said that she had died. Thus by a fair harmony
          of events Heaven ordained, that when some saw her departure out of
          this world, the others should have knowledge of her entrance into
          the eternal life of souls. These monasteries are about thirteen
          miles distant from each other.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is also told,
          that her death was, in a vision, made known the same night to one
          of the virgins dedicated to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page277">[pg 277]</span><a name="Pg277" id="Pg277" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> God, who loved her with a great love, in the
          same monastery where the said handmaid of God died. This nun saw
          her soul ascend to heaven in the company of angels; and this she
          openly declared, in the very same hour that it happened, to those
          handmaids of Christ that were with her; and aroused them to pray
          for her soul, even before the rest of the community had heard of
          her death. The truth of which was known to the whole community in
          the morning. This same nun was at that time with some other
          handmaids of Christ, in the remotest part of the monastery, where
          the women who had lately entered the monastic life were wont to
          pass their time of probation, till they were instructed according
          to rule, and admitted into the fellowship of the community.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There was in the
          monastery of this abbess a certain brother, marked in a special
          manner by the grace of God, for he was wont to make songs of piety
          and religion, so that whatever was expounded to him out of
          Scripture, he turned ere long into verse expressive of much
          sweetness and penitence, in English, which was his native language.
          By his songs the minds of many were often fired with contempt of
          the world, and desire of the heavenly life. Others of the English
          nation after him <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page278">[pg
          278]</span><a name="Pg278" id="Pg278" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          attempted to compose religious poems, but none could equal him, for
          he did not learn the art of poetry from men, neither was he taught
          by man, but by God's grace he received the free gift of song, for
          which reason he never could compose any trivial or vain poem, but
          only those which concern religion it behoved his religious tongue
          to utter. For having lived in the secular habit till he was well
          advanced in years, he had never learned anything of versifying; and
          for this reason sometimes at a banquet, when it was agreed to make
          merry by singing in turn, if he saw the harp come towards him, he
          would rise up from table and go out and return home.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Once having done
          so and gone out of the house where the banquet was, to the stable,
          where he had to take care of the cattle that night, he there
          composed himself to rest at the proper time. Thereupon one stood by
          him in his sleep, and saluting him, and calling him by his name,
          said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Cædmon, sing me something.”</span>
          But he answered, <span class="tei tei-q">“I cannot sing, and for
          this cause I left the banquet and retired hither, because I could
          not sing.”</span> Then he who talked to him replied, <span class="tei tei-q">“Nevertheless thou must needs sing to me.”</span>
          <span class="tei tei-q">“What must I sing?”</span> he asked.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Sing the beginning of creation,”</span>
          said the other. Having received this answer he straightway began to
          sing verses to the praise of God the Creator, which he had never
          heard, the purport whereof was after this manner: <span class="tei tei-q">“Now must we praise the Maker of the heavenly kingdom,
          the power of the Creator and His counsel, the deeds of the Father
          of glory. How He, being the eternal God, became the Author of all
          wondrous works, Who being the Almighty Guardian of the human race,
          first created heaven for the sons of men to be the covering of
          their dwelling place, and next the earth.”</span> This is the sense
          but not the order of the words as he sang them in his sleep; for
          verses, though never so well composed, cannot be literally
          translated out of one language into another without loss of their
          beauty and loftiness. Awaking from his sleep, he remembered all
          that he had sung in his dream, and soon added more after the same
          manner, in words which worthily expressed the praise of
          God.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page279">[pg
          279]</span><a name="Pg279" id="Pg279" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the morning
          he came to the reeve<a id="noteref_710" name="noteref_710" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_710"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">710</span></span></a> who
          was over him, and having told him of the gift he had received, was
          conducted to the abbess, and bidden, in the presence of many
          learned men, to tell his dream, and repeat the verses, that they
          might all examine and give their judgement upon the nature and
          origin of the gift whereof he spoke. And they all judged that
          heavenly grace had been granted to him by the Lord. They expounded
          to him a passage of sacred history or doctrine, enjoining upon him,
          if he could, to put it into verse. Having undertaken this task, he
          went away, and returning the next morning, gave them the passage he
          had been bidden to translate, rendered in most excellent verse.
          Whereupon the abbess, joyfully recognizing the grace of God in the
          man, instructed him to quit the secular habit, and take upon him
          monastic vows; and having received him into the monastery, she and
          all her people admitted him to the company of the brethren, and
          ordered that he should be taught the whole course of sacred
          history. So he, giving ear to all that he could learn, and bearing
          it in mind, and as it were ruminating, like a clean animal,<a id="noteref_711" name="noteref_711" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_711"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">711</span></span></a>
          turned it into most harmonious verse; and sweetly singing it, made
          his masters in their turn his hearers. He sang the creation of the
          world, the origin of man, and all the history of Genesis, the
          departure of the children of Israel out of Egypt, their entrance
          into the promised land, and many other histories from Holy
          Scripture; the Incarnation, Passion, Resurrection of our Lord, and
          His Ascension into heaven; the coming of the Holy Ghost, and the
          teaching of the Apostles; likewise he made many songs concerning
          the terror of future judgement, the horror of the pains of hell,
          and the joys of heaven; besides many more about the blessings and
          the judgements of God, by all of which he endeavoured to draw men
          away from the love of sin, and to excite in them devotion to
          well-doing and perseverance therein. For he was <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page280">[pg 280]</span><a name="Pg280" id="Pg280" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> a very religious man, humbly submissive
          to the discipline of monastic rule, but inflamed with fervent zeal
          against those who chose to do otherwise; for which reason he made a
          fair ending of his life.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For when the
          hour of his departure drew near, it was preceded by a bodily
          infirmity under which he laboured for the space of fourteen days,
          yet it was of so mild a nature that he could talk and go about the
          whole time. In his neighbourhood was the house to which those that
          were sick, and like to die, were wont to be carried. He desired the
          person that ministered to him, as the evening came on of the night
          in which he was to depart this life, to make ready a place there
          for him to take his rest. The man, wondering why he should desire
          it, because there was as yet no sign of his approaching death,
          nevertheless did his bidding. When they had lain down there, and
          had been conversing happily and pleasantly for some time with those
          that were in the house before, and it was now past midnight, he
          asked them, whether they had the Eucharist within?<a id="noteref_712" name="noteref_712" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_712"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">712</span></span></a> They
          answered, <span class="tei tei-q">“What need of the Eucharist? for
          you are not yet appointed to die, since you talk so merrily with
          us, as if you were in good health.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Nevertheless,”</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“bring me the Eucharist.”</span> Having received It
          into his hand, he asked, whether they were all in charity with him,
          and had no complaint against him, nor any quarrel or grudge. They
          answered, that they were all in perfect charity with him, and free
          from all anger; and in their turn they asked him to be of the same
          mind towards them. He answered at once, <span class="tei tei-q">“I
          am in charity, my children, with all the servants of God.”</span>
          Then strengthening himself with the heavenly Viaticum, he prepared
          for the entrance into another life, and asked how near the time was
          when the brothers should be awakened to sing the nightly praises of
          the Lord?<a id="noteref_713" name="noteref_713" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_713"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">713</span></span></a> They
          answered, <span class="tei tei-q">“It is not far off.”</span> Then
          he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“It is well, let us await that
          hour;”</span> and signing <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page281">[pg
          281]</span><a name="Pg281" id="Pg281" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          himself with the sign of the Holy Cross, he laid his head on the
          pillow, and falling into a slumber for a little while, so ended his
          life in silence.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus it came to
          pass, that as he had served the Lord with a simple and pure mind,
          and quiet devotion, so he now departed to behold His Presence,
          leaving the world by a quiet death; and that tongue, which had
          uttered so many wholesome words in praise of the Creator, spake its
          last words also in His praise, while he signed himself with the
          Cross, and commended his spirit into His hands; and by what has
          been here said, he seems to have had foreknowledge of his
          death.</p>

          appeared to a certain man of God before the monastery of the city
          Coludi was burned down.</span></h2>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At this time,
          the monastery of virgins, called the city of Coludi,<a id="noteref_714" name="noteref_714" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_714"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">714</span></span></a>
          above-mentioned, was burned down, through carelessness; and yet all
          that knew it might have been aware that it happened by reason of
          the wickedness of those who dwelt in it, and chiefly of those who
          seemed to be the greatest. But there wanted not a warning of the
          approaching punishment from the Divine mercy whereby they might
          have been led to amend their ways, and by fasting and tears and
          prayers, like the Ninevites, have averted the anger of the just
          Judge.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For there was in
          that monastery a man of the Scottish race, called Adamnan,<a id="noteref_715" name="noteref_715" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_715"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">715</span></span></a>
          leading a life entirely devoted to God in continence and prayer,
          insomuch that he never took any food or drink, except only on
          Sundays and Thursdays; and often spent whole nights in watching and
          prayer. This strictness in austerity of life he had first adopted
          from the necessity of correcting the evil that <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page282">[pg 282]</span><a name="Pg282" id="Pg282" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> was in him; but in process of time the
          necessity became a custom.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For in his youth
          he had been guilty of some sin for which, when he came to himself,
          he conceived a great horror, and dreaded lest he should be punished
          for the same by the righteous Judge. Betaking himself, therefore,
          to a priest, who, he hoped, might show him the way of salvation, he
          confessed his guilt, and desired to be advised how he might escape
          the wrath to come. The priest having heard his offence, said,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“A great wound requires greater care in the
          healing thereof; wherefore give yourself as far as you are able to
          fasting and psalms, and prayer, to the end that thus coming before
          the presence of the Lord in confession,”</span><a id="noteref_716" name="noteref_716" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_716"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">716</span></span></a> you
          may find Him merciful. But he, being oppressed with great grief by
          reason of his guilty conscience, and desiring to be the sooner
          loosed from the inward fetters of sin, which lay heavy upon him,
          answered, <span class="tei tei-q">“I am still young in years and
          strong of body, and shall, therefore, easily bear all whatsoever
          you shall enjoin me to do, if so be that I may be saved in the day
          of the Lord, even though you should bid me spend the whole night
          standing in prayer, and pass the whole week in abstinence.”</span>
          The priest replied, <span class="tei tei-q">“It is much for you to
          continue for a whole week without bodily sustenance; it is enough
          to observe a fast for two or three days; do this till I come again
          to you in a short time, when I will more fully show you what you
          ought to do, and how long to persevere in your penance.”</span>
          Having so said, and prescribed the measure of his penance, the
          priest went away, and upon some sudden occasion passed over into
          Ireland, which was his native country, and returned no more to him,
          as he had appointed. But the man remembering this injunction and
          his own promise, gave himself up entirely to tears of penitence,
          holy vigils and continence; so that he only took food on Thursdays
          and Sundays, as has been said; and continued fasting all the other
          days of the week. When he heard that his priest had gone to
          Ireland, and had died there, he ever <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page283">[pg 283]</span><a name="Pg283" id="Pg283" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> after observed this manner of abstinence,
          which had been appointed for him as we have said; and as he had
          begun that course through the fear of God, in penitence for his
          guilt, so he still continued the same unremittingly for the love of
          God, and through delight in its rewards.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Having practised
          this carefully for a long time, it happened that he had gone on a
          certain day to a distance from the monastery, accompanied by one
          the brothers; and as they were returning from this journey, when
          they drew near to the monastery, and beheld its lofty buildings,
          the man of God burst into tears, and his countenance discovered the
          trouble of his heart. His companion, perceiving it, asked what was
          the reason, to which he answered: <span class="tei tei-q">“The time
          is at hand when a devouring fire shall reduce to ashes all the
          buildings which you here behold, both public and private.”</span>
          The other, hearing these words, when they presently came into the
          monastery, told them to Aebba,<a id="noteref_717" name="noteref_717" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_717"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">717</span></span></a> the
          mother of the community. She with good cause being much troubled at
          that prediction, called the man to her, and straitly questioned him
          concerning the matter and how he came to know it. He answered,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Being engaged one night lately in watching
          and singing psalms, on a sudden I saw one standing by me whose
          countenance I did not know, and I was startled at his presence, but
          he bade me not to fear, and speaking to me like a friend he said,
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘You do well in that you have chosen rather
          at this time of rest not to give yourself up to sleep, but to
          continue in watching and prayer.’</span> I answered, <span class="tei tei-q">‘I know I have great need to continue in wholesome
          watching and earnest prayer to the Lord to pardon my
          transgressions.’</span> He replied, <span class="tei tei-q">‘You
          speak truly, for you and many more have need to redeem their sins
          by good works, and when they cease from temporal labours, then to
          labour the more eagerly for desire of eternal blessings; but this
          very few do; for I, having now gone through all this monastery in
          order, have looked into the huts<a id="noteref_718" name="noteref_718" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_718"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">718</span></span></a> and
          beds of all, and found <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page284">[pg
          284]</span><a name="Pg284" id="Pg284" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          none of them except yourself busy about the health of his soul; but
          all of them, both men and women, are either sunk in slothful sleep,
          or are awake in order to commit sin; for even the cells that were
          built for prayer or reading, are now converted into places of
          feasting, drinking, talking, and other delights; the very virgins
          dedicated to God, laying aside the respect due to their profession,
          whensoever they are at leisure, apply themselves to weaving fine
          garments, wherewith to adorn themselves like brides, to the danger
          of their state, or to gain the friendship of strange men; for which
          reason, as is meet, a heavy judgement from Heaven with raging fire
          is ready to fall on this place and those that dwell
          therein.’</span> ”</span> The abbess said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Why did you not sooner reveal to me what you
          knew?”</span> He answered, <span class="tei tei-q">“I was afraid to
          do it, out of respect to you, lest you should be too much
          afflicted; yet you may have this comfort, that the blow will not
          fall in your days.”</span> This vision being made known, the
          inhabitants of that place were for a few days in some little fear,
          and leaving off their sins, began to do penance; but after the
          death of the abbess they returned to their former defilement, nay,
          they committed worse sins; and when they said <span class="tei tei-q">“Peace and safety,”</span> the doom of the aforesaid
          judgement came suddenly upon them.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That all this
          fell out after this manner, was told me by my most reverend
          fellow-priest, Aedgils, who then lived in that monastery.
          Afterwards, when many of the inhabitants had departed thence, on
          account of the destruction, he lived a long time in our
          monastery,<a id="noteref_719" name="noteref_719" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_719"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">719</span></span></a> and
          died there. We have thought fit to insert this in our History, to
          admonish the reader of the works of the Lord, how terrible He is in
          His doing toward the children of men, lest haply we should at some
          time or other yield to the snares of the flesh, and dreading too
          little the judgement of God, fall under His sudden wrath, and
          either in His righteous anger be brought low with temporal losses,
          or else be more strictly tried and snatched away to eternal
          perdition.</p>

          an army into Ireland, miserably laid waste that unoffending nation,
          which had always been most friendly to the English; insomuch that
          the invading force spared not even the churches or monasteries. But
          the islanders, while to the utmost of their power they repelled
          force with force, implored the assistance of the Divine mercy, and
          with constant imprecations invoked the vengeance of Heaven; and
          though such as curse cannot inherit the kingdom of God, yet it was
          believed, that those who were justly cursed on account of their
          impiety, soon suffered the penalty of their guilt at the avenging
          hand of God. For the very next year, when that same king had rashly

          advising him not to attack the Scots, who were doing him no harm,
          it was laid upon him as a punishment for his sin, that he should
          now not listen to those who would have prevented his death.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From that time

          the Picts recovered their own lands, which had been held by the

          regained their liberty, which they have now enjoyed for about
          forty-six years. Among the many English that then either fell by
          the sword, or were made slaves, or escaped by flight out of the
          country of the Picts, the most reverend man of God, Trumwine,<a id="noteref_728" name="noteref_728" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_728"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">728</span></span></a> who
          had been made bishop over them, withdrew with his people that were

          is the boundary between the lands of the English and the Picts.
          Having commended his followers, wheresoever he could, to his
          friends in the monasteries, he chose his own place of abode in the
          monastery, which we have so often mentioned, of servants and
          handmaids of God, at Streanaeshalch;<a id="noteref_730" name="noteref_730" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_730"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">730</span></span></a> and
          there for many years, with a few of his own brethren, he led a life
          in all monastic austerity, not only to his own benefit, but to the
          benefit of many others, and dying there, he was buried in the
          church of the blessed Peter the Apostle,<a id="noteref_731" name="noteref_731" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_731"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">731</span></span></a> with

          found in him the greatest help in governing, and comfort in her
          private life. Aldfrid<a id="noteref_733" name="noteref_733" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_733"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">733</span></span></a>

          had always been inflamed with the desire of a religious life; and
          he adopted the name and habit of a monk when he was quite a young
          man: he first entered the monastery of Mailros,<a id="noteref_743" name="noteref_743" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_743"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">743</span></span></a> which

          of great gentleness and simplicity, who was afterward made bishop
          of the church of Hagustald or Lindisfarne,<a id="noteref_745" name="noteref_745" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_745"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">745</span></span></a> as
          has been said above. The provost of the monastery at that time was
          Boisil,<a id="noteref_746" name="noteref_746" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_746"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">746</span></span></a> a
          priest of great virtue and of a prophetic spirit. Cuthbert, humbly
          submitting himself <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page289">[pg
          289]</span><a name="Pg289" id="Pg289" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          to this man's direction, from him received both a knowledge of the
          Scriptures, and an example of good works.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After he had
          departed to the Lord, Cuthbert became provost of that monastery,
          where he instructed many in the rule of monastic life, both by the
          authority of a master, and the example of his own behaviour. Nor
          did he bestow his teaching and his example in the monastic life on
          his monastery alone, but laboured far and wide to convert the
          people dwelling round about from the life of foolish custom, to the
          love of heavenly joys; for many profaned the faith which they held
          by their wicked actions; and some also, in the time of a
          pestilence, neglecting the mysteries of the faith which they had
          received, had recourse to the false remedies of idolatry, as if
          they could have put a stop to the plague sent from God, by
          incantations, amulets, or any other secrets of the Devil's art. In
          order to correct the error of both sorts, he often went forth from
          the monastery, sometimes on horseback, but oftener on foot, and
          went to the neighbouring townships, where he preached the way of
          truth to such as had gone astray; which Boisil also in his time had
          been wont to do. It was then the custom of the English people, that
          when a clerk or priest came to a township, they all, at his
          summons, flocked together to hear the Word; willingly heard what
          was said, and still more willingly practised those things that they
          could hear and understand. And such was Cuthbert's skill in
          speaking, so keen his desire to persuade men of what he taught,
          such a light shone in his angelic face, that no man present dared
          to conceal from him the secrets of his heart, but all openly
          revealed in confession what they had done, thinking doubtless that
          their guilt could in nowise be hidden from him; and having
          confessed their sins, they wiped them out by fruits worthy of
          repentance, as he bade them. He was wont chiefly to resort to those
          places and preach in those villages which were situated afar off
          amid steep and wild mountains, so that others dreaded to go
          thither, and whereof the poverty and barbarity rendered them
          inaccessible to other teachers. But he, devoting himself entirely
          to that pious labour, so industriously ministered <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page290">[pg 290]</span><a name="Pg290" id="Pg290" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> to them with his wise teaching, that
          when he went forth from the monastery, he would often stay a whole
          week, sometimes two or three, or even sometimes a full month,
          before he returned home, continuing among the hill folk to call
          that simple people by his preaching and good works to the things of
          Heaven.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This venerable
          servant of the Lord, having thus spent many years in the monastery
          of Mailros, and there become conspicuous by great tokens of virtue,
          his most reverend abbot, Eata, removed him to the isle of
          Lindisfarne, that he might there also, by his authority as provost
          and by the example of his own practice, instruct the brethren in
          the observance of regular discipline; for the same reverend father
          then governed that place also as abbot. From ancient times, the
          bishop was wont to reside there with his clergy, and the abbot with
          his monks, who were likewise under the paternal care of the bishop;
          because Aidan, who was the first bishop of the place, being himself

          the blessed Father Augustine is known to have done before in Kent,

          <span style="font-size: 144%">Chap. XXVIII. How the same St.
          Cuthbert, living the life of an Anchorite, by his prayers obtained
          a spring in a dry soil, and had a crop from seed sown by the labour
          of his hands out of season. [676</span> <span class="tei tei-hi" style="text-align: left"><span style="font-size: 144%; font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span><span style="font-size: 144%">]</span></h2>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After this,
          Cuthbert, as he grew in goodness and intensity of devotion,
          attained also to a hermit's life of contemplation in silence and
          solitude, as we have mentioned. But forasmuch as many years ago we
          wrote enough concerning his life and virtues, both in heroic verse
          and prose,<a id="noteref_749" name="noteref_749" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_749"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">749</span></span></a> it
          may suffice at present only to mention this, that when he was about
          to go to the island, he declared to the brothers, <span class="tei tei-q">“If by the grace of God it shall be granted to me, that
          I may live in that place by the labour of my hands, I will
          willingly abide there; but if not, God willing, I will very soon
          return to you.”</span> The place was quite destitute of water,
          corn, and trees; and being infested by evil spirits, was very ill
          suited for human habitation; but it became in all respects
          habitable, at the desire of the man of God; for at his coming the
          wicked spirits departed. When, after expelling the enemy, he had,
          with the help of the brethren, built himself a narrow dwelling,
          with a mound about it, and the necessary cells in it, to wit, an
          oratory and a common living room, he ordered the brothers to dig a
          pit in the floor of the room, although the ground was hard and
          stony, and no hopes appeared of any spring. When they had done this
          relying upon the faith and prayers of the servant of God, the next
          day it was found to be full of water, and to this day affords
          abundance of its heavenly bounty to all that resort thither. He
          also desired that instruments for husbandry might be brought him,
          and some wheat; but having prepared the ground and sown the wheat
          at the proper season, no sign of a blade, not to speak of ears, had
          sprouted from it by the summer. Hereupon, when the brethren visited
          him according to custom, he ordered barley to be brought him, if
          haply it <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page292">[pg
          292]</span><a name="Pg292" id="Pg292" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          were either the nature of the soil, or the will of God, the Giver
          of all things, that such grain rather should grow there. He sowed
          it in the same field, when it was brought him, after the proper
          time of sowing, and therefore without any likelihood of its bearing
          fruit; but a plentiful crop immediately sprang up, and afforded the
          man of God the means which he had desired of supporting himself by
          his own labour.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When he had here
          served God in solitude many years, the mound which encompassed his
          dwelling being so high, that he could see nothing from it but
          heaven, which he thirsted to enter, it happened that a great synod
          was assembled in the presence of King Egfrid, near the river Alne,
          at a place called Adtuifyrdi,<a id="noteref_750" name="noteref_750" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_750"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">750</span></span></a> which
          signifies <span class="tei tei-q">“at the two fords,”</span> in
          which Archbishop Theodore, of blessed memory, presided, and there
          Cuthbert was, with one mind and consent of all, chosen bishop of
          the church of Lindisfarne. They could not, however, draw him from
          his hermitage, though many messengers and letters were sent to him.
          At last the aforesaid king himself, with the most holy Bishop
          Trumwine,<a id="noteref_751" name="noteref_751" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_751"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">751</span></span></a> and
          other religious and powerful men, sailed to the island; many also
          of the brothers from the isle of Lindisfarne itself, assembled
          together for the same purpose: they all knelt, and conjured him by
          the Lord, with tears and entreaties, till they drew him, also in
          tears, from his beloved retreat, and forced him to go to the synod.
          When he arrived there, he was very reluctantly overcome by the
          unanimous resolution of all present, and compelled to take upon
          himself the duties of the episcopate; being chiefly prevailed upon
          by the words of Boisil, the servant of God, who, when he had
          prophetically<a id="noteref_752" name="noteref_752" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_752"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">752</span></span></a>
          foretold all things that were to befall him, had also predicted
          that he should be a bishop. Nevertheless, the consecration was not
          appointed <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page293">[pg
          293]</span><a name="Pg293" id="Pg293" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          immediately; but when the winter, which was then at hand, was over,
          it was carried out at Easter,<a id="noteref_753" name="noteref_753" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_753"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">753</span></span></a> in
          the city of York, and in the presence of the aforesaid King Egfrid;
          seven bishops coming together for his consecration, among whom,
          Theodore, of blessed memory, was Primate. He was first elected
          bishop of the church of Hagustald, in the place of Tunbert,<a id="noteref_754" name="noteref_754" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_754"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">754</span></span></a> who
          had been deposed from the episcopate; but because he chose rather
          to be placed over the church of Lindisfarne, in which he had lived,
          it was thought fit that Eata should return to the see of the church
          of Hagustald, to which he had been first ordained, and that
          Cuthbert should take upon him the government of the church of
          Lindisfarne.<a id="noteref_755" name="noteref_755" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_755"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">755</span></span></a></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Following the
          example of the blessed Apostles, he adorned the episcopal dignity
          by his virtuous deeds; for he both protected the people committed
          to his charge by constant prayer, and roused them, by wholesome
          admonitions, to thoughts of Heaven. He first showed in his own life
          what he taught others to do, a practice which greatly strengthens
          all teaching; for he was above all things inflamed with the fire of
          Divine charity, of sober mind and patient, most diligently intent
          on devout prayers, and kindly to all that came to him for comfort.
          He thought it stood in the stead of prayer to afford the weak
          brethren the help of his exhortation, knowing that he who said
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou shalt love the Lord thy God,”</span>
          said likewise, <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou shalt love thy
          neighbour.”</span> He was noted for penitential abstinence, and was
          always through the grace of compunction, intent upon heavenly
          things. And when he offered up to God the Sacrifice of the saving
          Victim, he commended his prayer to the Lord, not with uplifted
          voice, but with tears drawn from the bottom of his heart.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Having spent two

          warned of God that the day of his death, or rather of his entrance

          persons, though in words which were somewhat obscure, but which
          were nevertheless afterwards plainly understood; while to others he
          declared the same openly.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There was a
          certain priest, called Herebert, a man of holy life, who had long
          been united with the man of God, Cuthbert, in the bonds of
          spiritual friendship. This man leading a solitary life in the
          island of that great lake from which the river Derwent flows at its
          beginning,<a id="noteref_757" name="noteref_757" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_757"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">757</span></span></a> was
          wont to visit him every year, and to receive from him the teaching
          of everlasting salvation. Hearing that Bishop Cuthbert was come to
          the city of Lugubalia,<a id="noteref_758" name="noteref_758" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_758"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">758</span></span></a> he
          went thither to him, according to his custom, seeking to be more
          and more inflamed in heavenly desires through his wholesome
          admonitions. Whilst they alternately entertained one another with
          draughts of the celestial life, the bishop, among other things,
          said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Brother Herebert, remember at this
          time to ask me and speak to me concerning all whereof you have need
          to ask and speak; for, when we part, we shall never again see one
          another with bodily eyesight in this world. For I know of a surety
          that the time of my departure is at hand, and that shortly I must
          put off this my tabernacle.”</span> Hearing these words, Herebert
          fell down at his feet, with tears and lamentations, and said,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“I beseech you, by the Lord, not to forsake
          me; but to remember your most <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page295">[pg 295]</span><a name="Pg295" id="Pg295" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> faithful companion, and entreat the mercy of
          God that, as we have served Him together upon earth, so we may
          depart together to behold His grace in Heaven. For you know that I
          have always endeavoured to live according to the words of your
          lips, and likewise whatsoever faults I have committed, either
          through ignorance or frailty, I have instantly sought to amend
          according to the judgement of your will.”</span> The bishop applied
          himself to prayer, and having presently had intimation in the
          spirit that he had obtained what he asked of the Lord, he said,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Rise, brother, and do not weep, but
          rejoice greatly because the mercy of Heaven has granted what we
          desired.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The event
          established the truth of this promise and prophecy, for after their
          parting, they never again saw one another in the flesh; but their
          spirits quitting their bodies on one and the same day, to wit, the
          20th of March,<a id="noteref_759" name="noteref_759" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_759"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">759</span></span></a> were
          immediately united in fellowship in the blessed vision, and
          together translated to the heavenly kingdom by the ministry of
          angels. But Herebert was first wasted by a long-continued
          infirmity, through the dispensation of the Lord's mercy, as may be
          believed, to the end that if he was in any wise inferior in merit
          to the blessed Cuthbert, that which was lacking might be supplied
          by the chastening pain of a long sickness, that being thus made
          equal in grace to his intercessor, as he departed out of the body
          at one and the same time with him, so he might be accounted worthy
          to be received into the like abode of eternal bliss.</p>

          entreaties, he consented to be carried back to the isle of

          Cuthbert, whereas the loftiness of his life before his death had
          been revealed by the testimony of many miracles, when he had been
          buried eleven years, Divine Providence put it into the minds of the
          brethren to take up his bones. They thought to find them dry and
          all the rest of the body consumed and turned to dust, after the
          manner of the dead, and they desired to put them into a new coffin,
          and to lay them in the same place, but above the pavement, for the
          honour due to him. They made known their resolve to Bishop Eadbert,
          and he consented to it, and bade them to be mindful to do it on the
          anniversary of his burial. They did so, and opening the grave,
          found all the body whole, as if he were still alive, and the joints
          of the limbs pliable, like one asleep rather than dead; besides,
          all the vestments in which he was clothed were not only undefiled,
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page297">[pg 297]</span><a name="Pg297" id="Pg297" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> but marvellous to
          behold, being fresh and bright as at the first. The brothers seeing
          this, were struck with a great dread, and hastened to tell the
          bishop what they had found; he being then alone in a place remote
          from the church, and encompassed on all sides by the shifting waves
          of the sea. There he always used to spend the time of Lent, and was
          wont to pass the forty days before the Nativity of our Lord, in
          great devotion with abstinence and prayer and tears. There also his
          venerable predecessor, Cuthbert, had for some time served as the
          soldier of the Lord in solitude before he went to the isle of
          Farne.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They brought him
          also some part of the garments that had covered the holy body;
          which presents he thankfully accepted, and gladly heard of the
          miracles, and he kissed the garments even, with great affection, as
          if they had been still upon his father's body, and said,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Let new garments be put upon the body, in
          place of these you have brought, and so lay it in the coffin which
          you have prepared; for I know of a surety that the place will not
          long remain empty, which has been hallowed with so great grace of
          heavenly miracles; and how happy is he to whom the Lord, the Author
          and Giver of all bliss, shall vouchsafe to grant the privilege of
          resting therein.”</span> When the bishop had made an end of saying
          this and more in like manner, with many tears and great compunction
          and with faltering tongue, the brothers did as he had commanded
          them, and when they had wrapped the body in new garments, and laid
          it in a new coffin, they placed it above the pavement of the
          sanctuary. Soon after, Bishop Eadbert, beloved of God, fell
          grievously sick, and his fever daily increasing in severity, ere
          long, that is, on the 6th of May,<a id="noteref_763" name="noteref_763" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_763"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">763</span></span></a> he
          also departed to the Lord, and they laid his body in the grave of
          the blessed father Cuthbert, placing over it the coffin, with the
          uncorrupted remains of that father. The miracles of healing,
          sometimes wrought in that place testify to the merits of them both;
          of some of these we <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page298">[pg

          have before preserved the memory in the book of his life. But in
          this History we have thought fit to add some others which have
          lately come to our knowledge.</p>

          <span style="font-size: 144%">Chap. XXXI. Of one that was cured of
          a palsy at his tomb.</span></h2>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There was in
          that same monastery a brother whose name was Badudegn, who had for
          no small time ministered to the guests of the house, and is still
          living, having the testimony of all the brothers and strangers
          resorting thither, of being a man of much piety and religion, and
          serving the office put upon him only for the sake of the heavenly
          reward. This man, having one day washed in the sea the coverings or
          blankets which he used in the guest chamber, was returning home,
          when on the way, he was seized with a sudden infirmity, insomuch
          that he fell to the ground, and lay there a long time and could
          scarce at last rise again. When he got up, he felt one half of his
          body, from the head to the foot, struck with palsy, and with great
          trouble made his way home by the help of a staff. The disease
          increased by degrees, and as night approached, became still worse,
          so that when day returned, he could scarcely rise or walk alone.
          Suffering from this trouble, he conceived the wise resolve to go to
          the church, as best he could, and approach the tomb of the reverend
          father Cuthbert, and there, on his knees, humbly beseech the mercy
          of God that he might either be delivered from that disease, if it
          were well for him, or if by the grace of God it was ordained for
          him to be chastened longer by this affliction, that he might bear
          the pain which was laid upon him with patience and a quiet
          mind.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He did
          accordingly as he had determined, and supporting his weak limbs
          with a staff, entered the church. There prostrating himself before
          the body of the man of God, he prayed with pious earnestness, that,
          through his intercession, the Lord might be propitious to him. As
          he prayed, he seemed to fall into a deep sleep, and, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page299">[pg 299]</span><a name="Pg299" id="Pg299" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> as he was afterwards wont to relate,
          felt a large and broad hand touch his head, where the pain lay, and
          likewise pass over all that part of his body which had been
          benumbed by the disease, down to his feet. Gradually the pain
          departed and health returned. Then he awoke, and rose up in perfect
          health, and returning thanks to the Lord for his recovery, told the
          brothers what had been done for him; and to the joy of them all,
          returned the more zealously, as if chastened by the trial of his
          affliction, to the service which he was wont before to perform with
          care.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Moreover, the
          very garments which had been on Cuthbert's body, dedicated to God,
          either while he was alive, or after his death, were not without the
          virtue of healing, as may be seen in the book of his life and
          miracles, by such as shall read it.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nor is that cure
          to be passed over in silence, which was performed by his relics
          three years ago, and was told me lately by the brother himself, on
          whom it was wrought. It happened in the monastery, which, being
          built near the river Dacore,<a id="noteref_764" name="noteref_764" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_764"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">764</span></span></a> has
          taken its name from the same, over which, at that time, the
          religious Suidbert<a id="noteref_765" name="noteref_765" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_765"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">765</span></span></a>
          presided as abbot. In that monastery was a youth whose eyelid was
          disfigured by an unsightly tumour, which growing daily greater,
          threatened the loss of the eye. The physicians endeavoured to
          mitigate it by applying ointments, but in vain. Some said it ought
          to be cut off; others opposed this course, for fear of greater
          danger. The brother having long laboured under this malady, when no
          human means availed to save his eye, but rather, it grew daily
          worse, on a sudden, through the grace of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page300">[pg 300]</span><a name="Pg300" id="Pg300" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> mercy of God, it came to pass that he
          was cured by the relics of the holy father, Cuthbert. For when the
          brethren found his body uncorrupted, after having been many years
          buried, they took some part of the hair, to give, as relics, to
          friends who asked for them, or to show, in testimony of the
          miracle.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One of the
          priests of the monastery, named Thruidred, who is now abbot there,
          had a small part of these relics by him at that time. One day he
          went into the church and opened the box of relics, to give some
          part of them to a friend who asked for it, and it happened that the
          youth who had the diseased eye was then in the church. The priest,
          having given his friend as much as he thought fit, gave the rest to
          the youth to put back into its place. But he having received the
          hairs of the holy head, prompted by some salutary impulse, applied
          them to the diseased eyelid, and endeavoured for some time, by the
          application of them, to abate and mitigate the tumour. Having done
          this, he again laid the relics in the box, as he had been bidden,
          believing that his eye would soon be cured by the hairs of the man
          of God, which had touched it; nor did his faith disappoint him. It
          was then, as he is wont to relate, about the second hour of the
          day; but while he was occupied with other thoughts and business of
          the day, on a sudden, about the sixth hour of the same, touching
          his eye, he found it and the eyelid as sound as if there never had
          been any disfigurement or tumour on it.</p>

          consecrated his office by deeds worthy of that degree for many
          years in the monastery which is called Inhrypum.<a id="noteref_768" name="noteref_768" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_768"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">768</span></span></a> To
          the end that his merit and manner of life may be the more certainly
          made known, I will relate one miracle of his, which was told me by
          one of the brothers for and on whom the same was wrought; to wit,
          Guthfrid, the venerable servant and priest of Christ, who also,
          afterwards, as abbot, presided over the brethren of the same church
          of Lindisfarne, in which he was educated.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I came,”</span> says he, <span class="tei tei-q">“to
          the island of Farne, with two others of the brethren, desiring to
          speak with the most reverend father, Ethelwald. Having been
          refreshed with his discourse, and asked for his blessing, as we
          were returning home, behold on a sudden, when we were in the midst
          of the sea, the fair weather in which we were sailing, was broken,
          and there arose so great and terrible a tempest, that neither sails
          nor oars were of any use to us, nor had we anything to expect but
          death. After long struggling with the wind and waves to no effect,
          at last we looked back to see whether it was possible by any means
          at least to return to the island whence we came, but we found that
          we were on all sides alike cut off by the storm, and that there was
          no hope of escape by our own <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page302">[pg 302]</span><a name="Pg302" id="Pg302" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> efforts. But looking further, we perceived,
          on the island of Farne, our father Ethelwald, beloved of God, come
          out of his retreat to watch our course; for, hearing the noise of
          the tempest and raging sea, he had come forth to see what would
          become of us. When he beheld us in distress and despair, he bowed
          his knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, in prayer for our
          life and safety; and as he finished his prayer, he calmed the
          swelling water, in such sort that the fierceness of the storm
          ceased on all sides, and fair winds attended us over a smooth sea
          to the very shore. When we had landed, and had pulled up our small
          vessel from the waves, the storm, which had ceased a short time for
          our sake, presently returned, and raged furiously during the whole
          day; so that it plainly appeared that the brief interval of calm
          had been granted by Heaven in answer to the prayers of the man of
          God, to the end that we might escape.”</span></p>

          dedicated to St. Michael the Archangel, where the man of God used
          frequently, as occasion offered, and specially in Lent, to abide
          with a few companions and in quiet give himself to prayer and
          study. Having come hither once at the beginning of Lent to stay, he
          bade his followers find out some poor man labouring under any
          grievous infirmity, or want, whom they might keep with them during
          those days, to receive alms, for so he was always used to do.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There was in a
          township not far off, a certain youth who was dumb, known to the
          bishop, for he often used to come into his presence to receive
          alms. He had never been able to speak one word; besides, he had so
          much scurf and scab on his head, that no hair could ever grow on
          the top of it, but only some rough hairs stood on end round about
          it. The bishop caused this young man to be brought, and a little
          hut to be made for him within the enclosure of the dwelling, in
          which he might abide, and receive alms from him every day. When one
          week of Lent was over, the next Sunday he bade the poor
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page304">[pg 304]</span><a name="Pg304" id="Pg304" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> man come to him, and
          when he had come, he bade him put his tongue out of his mouth and
          show it him; then taking him by the chin, he made the sign of the
          Holy Cross on his tongue, directing him to draw it back so signed
          into his mouth and to speak. <span class="tei tei-q">“Pronounce
          some word,”</span> said he; <span class="tei tei-q">“say
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘gae,’</span> ”</span> which, in the
          language of the English, is the word of affirming and consenting,
          that is, yes. The youth's tongue was immediately loosed, and he
          spoke as he was bidden. The bishop then added the names of the
          letters: <span class="tei tei-q">“Say A.”</span> He said A.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Say B;”</span> he said B also. When he had
          repeated all the letters after the bishop, the latter proceeded to
          put syllables and words to him, and when he had repeated them all
          rightly he bade him utter whole sentences, and he did it. Nor did
          he cease all that day and the next night, as long as he could keep
          awake, as those who were present relate, to say something, and to
          express his private thoughts and wishes to others, which he could
          never do before; after the manner of the man long lame, who, when
          he was healed by the Apostles Peter and John,<a id="noteref_777" name="noteref_777" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_777"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">777</span></span></a>
          leaping up, stood and walked, and entered with them into the
          temple, walking, and leaping, and praising the Lord, rejoicing to
          have the use of his feet, which he had so long lacked. The bishop,
          rejoicing with him at his cure, caused the physician to take in
          hand the healing of the sores of his head. He did as he was bidden,
          and with the help of the bishop's blessing and prayers, a goodly
          head of hair grew as the skin was healed. Thus the youth became
          fair of countenance, ready of speech, with hair curling in comely
          fashion, whereas before he had been ill-favoured, miserable, and
          dumb. Thus filled with joy at his recovered health, notwithstanding
          that the bishop offered to keep him in his own household, he chose
          rather to return home.</p>

          seized with an attack of sudden pain, which speedily increased,
          while the wounded arm became worse, and so much swollen, that it
          could scarce be compassed with both hands; and she lay in bed like
          to die through excess of pain. Wherefore the abbess entreated the
          bishop that he would vouchsafe to go in and give her his blessing;
          for she believed that she would soon be better if he blessed her or
          laid his hands upon her. He asked when the maiden had been let
          blood, and being told that it was on the fourth day of the moon,
          said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘You did very indiscreetly and

          blessed memory, said, that blood-letting at that time was very
          dangerous, when the light of the moon is waxing and the tide of the
          ocean is rising. And what can I do for the maiden if she is like to
          die?’</span></span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“But the abbess still earnestly entreated for her

          at last prevailed with him to go in and visit the sick maiden.
          Wherefore he went in, taking me with him to the maid, who lay, as I
          said, in sore anguish, and her arm swelling so greatly that it
          could not be bent at all at the elbow; and he stood and said a
          prayer over her, and having given his blessing, went out.
          Afterwards, as we were sitting at table, at the usual hour, some
          one came in and called me out, saying, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Quoenburg’</span> (that was the maid's name)
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘desires that you should immediately go
          back to her.’</span> This I did, and entering the chamber, I found
          her of more cheerful countenance, and like one in good health. And
          while I was sitting beside her, she said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Shall we call for something to
          drink?’</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">‘Yes,’</span> said I,
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘and right glad am I, if you can.’</span>
          When the cup was brought, and we had both drunk, she said,
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘As soon as the bishop had said the prayer
          for me and given me his blessing and had gone out, I immediately
          began to mend; and though I have not yet recovered my former
          strength, yet all the pain is quite gone both from my arm, where it
          was most burning, and from all my body, as if the bishop had
          carried it away with him; notwithstanding the swelling of the arm
          still seems to remain.’</span> But when we departed thence, the
          cure of the pain in her limbs was followed by the assuaging of the
          grievous swelling; and the maiden <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page307">[pg 307]</span><a name="Pg307" id="Pg307" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> being thus delivered from pains and death,
          returned praise to our Lord and Saviour, in company with His other

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The same abbot
          related another miracle, not unlike the former, of the aforesaid
          bishop. <span class="tei tei-q">“Not very far from our
          monastery,”</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“to wit, about
          two miles off, was the township<a id="noteref_784" name="noteref_784" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_784"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">784</span></span></a> of
          one Puch, a thegn, whose wife had lain sick of a very grievous
          disease for nearly forty days, insomuch that for three weeks she
          could not be carried out of the chamber where she lay. It happened
          that the man of God was, at that time, called thither by the thegn
          to consecrate a church; and when that was done, the thegn desired
          him to come into his house and dine. The bishop declined, saying
          that he must return to the monastery, which was very near. The
          thegn, entreating him more earnestly, vowed he would also give alms
          to the poor, if so be that the bishop would vouchsafe to enter his
          house that day and break his fast. I joined my entreaties to his,
          promising in like manner to give alms for the relief of the
          poor,<a id="noteref_785" name="noteref_785" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_785"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">785</span></span></a> if he
          would but go and dine at the thegn's house, and give his blessing.
          Having at length, with much difficulty, prevailed, we went in to
          refresh ourselves. The bishop had sent to the woman that lay sick
          some of the holy water, which he had blessed for the consecration
          of the church, by one of the brothers who had come with me,
          ordering him to give her some to drink, and wash that part of her
          where he found that her pain was greatest, with some of the same
          water. This being done, the woman immediately got up whole and
          sound, and perceiving that she had not only been delivered from her
          long sickness, but at the same time had recovered the strength
          which she had lost for <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page308">[pg

          so great a time, she presented the cup to the bishop and to us, and
          continued serving us with meat and drink as she had begun, till
          dinner was over; following the example of the blessed Peter's
          wife's mother, who, having been sick of a fever, arose at the touch
          of our Lord's hand, and having forthwith received health and
          strength, ministered to them.”</span><a id="noteref_786" name="noteref_786" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_786"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">786</span></span></a></p>

          thegn named Addi, when he had performed the required duty, he was
          entreated by the thegn to go in to one of his servants, who lay
          dangerously ill, insomuch that having lost all use of his limbs, he
          seemed to be at the point of death; and moreover the coffin had
          been made ready wherein to bury him after his death. The thegn
          urged his entreaties with tears, earnestly beseeching him that he
          would go in and pray for the servant, because his life was of great
          moment to him; and he believed that if the bishop would lay his
          hand upon him and give him his blessing, he would soon mend. So the
          bishop went in, and saw him very near death, and by his side the
          coffin in which he was to be laid for his burial, whilst all
          mourned. He said a prayer and blessed him, and going out, spake the
          wonted words of comfort, <span class="tei tei-q">“Good health be
          yours and that speedily.”</span> Afterwards, when they were sitting
          at table, the servant sent to his lord, desiring that he would let
          him have a cup of wine, because he was thirsty. The thegn,
          rejoicing greatly that he could drink, sent him a cup of wine,
          blessed by the bishop; and, as soon as he had drunk it, he
          immediately got up, and, shaking off the heaviness of his
          infirmity, dressed himself and went forth, and going in to the
          bishop, saluted him and the other guests, saying <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page309">[pg 309]</span><a name="Pg309" id="Pg309" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> that he also would gladly eat and drink
          with them. They bade him sit down with them at table, greatly
          rejoicing at his recovery. He sat down, ate and drank and made
          merry, and behaved himself like the rest of the company; and living
          many years after, continued in the same health which he had gained.

          <span class="tei tei-q">“Living with him,”</span> said he,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“and being very well acquainted with his
          course of life, I found it to be in all points worthy of a bishop,
          as far as it is lawful for men to judge; but I have known by the
          experience of others, and more particularly by my own, how great
          his merit was before Him Who seeth the heart; having been by his
          prayer and blessing recalled from the threshold of death and
          brought back to the way of life. For, when in the prime of my
          youth, I lived among his clergy, applying myself to reading and
          singing, but not having yet altogether withdrawn my heart from
          youthful pleasures, it happened one day that, as we were travelling
          with him, we came into a plain and open road, well fitted for
          galloping. The young men that were with him, and especially the
          laymen, began to entreat the bishop to give them leave to gallop,
          and make trial of their <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page310">[pg
          310]</span><a name="Pg310" id="Pg310" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          horses one with another. He at first refused, saying that it was an
          idle request; but at last, overcome by the unanimous desire of so
          many, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Do so,’</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">‘if you will, but let Herebald have no part in the
          trial.’</span> Then I earnestly prayed that I might have leave to
          compete with the rest, for I relied on an excellent horse, which he
          had himself given me, but I could in no wise obtain my
          request.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“When they had several times galloped backwards and
          forwards, the bishop and I looking on, my wanton humour prevailed,
          and I could no longer refrain, but though he forbade me, I struck
          in among them at their sport, and began to ride with them at full
          speed; whereat I heard him call after me with a groan, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Alas! how much you grieve me by riding after that
          manner.’</span> Though I heard him, I went on against his command;
          but immediately the fiery horse taking a great leap over a hollow
          place in the way, I fell, and at once lost all sense and motion,
          like one dying; for there was in that place a stone, level with the
          ground, covered with only a thin coating of turf, and no other
          stone was to be found in all that expanse of plain; and it happened
          by chance, or rather by Divine Providence so ordering it, to punish
          my disobedience, that my head and my hand, which in falling I had
          put under my head, struck upon that stone, so that my thumb was
          broken and my skull fractured, and I became, as I said, like one
          dead.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“And because I could not move, they stretched a tent
          there for me to lie in. It was about the seventh hour of the day,
          and having lain still and as it were dead from that time till the
          evening, I then revived a little, and was carried home by my
          companions, and lay speechless all the night, vomiting blood,
          because something was broken within me by the fall. The bishop was
          very much grieved at my fall and my misfortune, for he bore me
          extraordinary affection. Nor would he stay that night, as he was
          wont, among his clergy; but spent it alone in watching and prayer,
          imploring the Divine goodness, as I suppose, for my preservation.
          Coming to me early in the morning, and having said a prayer over
          me, he <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page311">[pg
          311]</span><a name="Pg311" id="Pg311" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          called me by my name, and when I awoke as it were out of a heavy
          sleep, he asked whether I knew who it was that spoke to me? I
          opened my eyes and said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Yes; you are my
          beloved bishop.’</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">‘Can you
          live?’</span> said he. I answered, <span class="tei tei-q">‘I can,
          through your prayers, if the Lord will.’</span></span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“He then laid his hand on my head, with the words of
          blessing, and returned to prayer; when he came again to see me, in
          a short time, he found me sitting and able to talk; and, being
          moved by Divine inspiration, as it soon appeared, began to ask me,
          whether I knew for certain that I had been baptized? I answered
          that I knew beyond all doubt that I had been washed in the font of
          salvation, for the remission of sins, and I named the priest by

          not perfect; for I know him, and that when he was ordained priest,
          he could in no wise, by reason of the dulness of his understanding,
          learn the ministry of catechizing and baptizing; for which reason I
          enjoined upon him altogether to desist from presuming to exercise
          that ministry, which he could not duly perform.’</span> This said,
          he set himself to catechize me that same hour; and it came to pass
          that when he breathed on my face,<a id="noteref_790" name="noteref_790" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_790"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">790</span></span></a>
          straightway I felt better. He called the surgeon and ordered him to
          set and bind up my skull where it was fractured; and presently
          having received his blessing, I was so much better that I mounted
          on horseback the next day, and travelled with him to another place;
          and being soon after perfectly recovered, I was washed in the water
          of life.”</span></p>

          Caedwalla, king of the West Saxons, having most vigorously governed
          his nation for two years, quitted his crown for the sake of the
          Lord and an everlasting kingdom, and went to Rome, being desirous
          to obtain the peculiar honour of being cleansed in the baptismal
          font at the threshold of the blessed Apostles, for he had learned
          that in Baptism alone the entrance into the heavenly life is opened
          to mankind; and he hoped at the same time, that being made clean by
          Baptism, he should soon be freed from the bonds of the flesh and
          pass to the eternal joys of Heaven; both which things, by the help
          of the Lord, came to pass according as he had conceived in his

          pope, he was baptized on the Holy Saturday before Easter Day,<a id="noteref_796" name="noteref_796" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_796"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">796</span></span></a> in

          fell sick, and was set free from the bonds of the flesh on the 20th
          of April, and obtained an entrance into the kingdom of the blessed
          in Heaven. At his baptism, the aforesaid pope had given him the
          name of Peter, to the end, that he might be also united in name to
          the most blessed chief of the Apostles, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page313">[pg 313]</span><a name="Pg313" id="Pg313" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> to whose most holy body his pious love had
          led him from the utmost bounds of the earth. He was likewise buried

          written on his tomb, wherein the memory of his devotion might be
          preserved for ever, and the readers or hearers thereof might be
          stirred up to give themselves to religion by the example of what he
          had done.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The epitaph was
          this:—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“High estate, wealth, offspring, a mighty kingdom,
          triumphs, spoils, chieftains, strongholds, the camp, a home;
          whatsoever the valour of his sires, whatsoever himself had won,
          Caedwal, mighty in war, left for the love of God, that, a pilgrim
          king, he might behold Peter and Peter's seat, receive at his font
          pure waters of life, and in bright draughts drink of the shining
          radiance whence a quickening glory streams through all the world.
          And even as he gained with eager soul the prize of the new life, he
          laid aside barbaric rage, and, changed in heart, he changed his
          name with joy. Sergius the Pope bade him be called Peter, himself
          his father,<a id="noteref_799" name="noteref_799" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_799"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">799</span></span></a> when
          he rose born anew from the font, and the grace of Christ, cleansing
          him, bore him forthwith clothed in white raiment to the heights of
          Heaven. O wondrous faith of the king, but greatest of all the mercy
          of Christ, into whose counsels none may enter! For he came in
          safety from the ends of the earth, even from Britain, through many
          a nation, over many a sea, by many a path, and saw the city of
          Romulus and looked upon Peter's sanctuary revered, bearing mystic
          gifts. He shall walk in white among the sheep of Christ in
          fellowship with them; for his body is in the tomb, but his soul on
          high. Thou mightest deem he did but change an earthly for a
          heavenly sceptre, whom thou seest attain to the kingdom of
          Christ.”</span></p>

          a certain day early in the morning one of the brethren, who had
          been a disciple of the priest, Boisil,<a id="noteref_816" name="noteref_816" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_816"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">816</span></span></a>
          beloved of God, and had ministered to him in Britain, when the said
          Boisil was provost of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page318">[pg
          318]</span><a name="Pg318" id="Pg318" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          monastery of Mailros,<a id="noteref_817" name="noteref_817" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_817"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">817</span></span></a> under
          the Abbot Eata, as has been said above.<a id="noteref_818" name="noteref_818" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_818"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">818</span></span></a> This
          brother told him a vision which he had seen that night.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“When after matins,”</span> said he,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“I had laid me down in my bed, and was
          fallen into a light slumber, Boisil, that was sometime my master
          and brought me up in all love, appeared to me, and asked, whether I
          knew him? I said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Yes, you are
          Boisil.’</span> He answered, <span class="tei tei-q">‘I am come to
          bring Egbert a message from our Lord and Saviour, which must
          nevertheless be delivered to him by you. Tell him, therefore, that
          he cannot perform the journey he has undertaken; for it is the will
          of God that he should rather go to teach the monasteries of
          Columba.’</span> ”</span><a id="noteref_819" name="noteref_819" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_819"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">819</span></span></a> Now
          Columba was the first teacher of the Christian faith to the Picts
          beyond the mountains northward, and the first founder of the
          monastery in the island of Hii, which was for a long time much
          honoured by many tribes of the Scots and Picts. The said Columba is
          now by some called Columcille, the name being compounded from
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Columba”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“Cella.”</span><a id="noteref_820" name="noteref_820" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_820"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">820</span></span></a>
          Egbert, having heard the words of the vision, charged the brother
          that had told it him, not to tell it to any other, lest haply it
          should be a lying vision. But when he considered the matter
          secretly with himself, he apprehended that it was true, yet would
          not desist from preparing for his voyage which he purposed to make
          to teach those nations.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A few days after
          the aforesaid brother came again to him, saying that Boisil had
          that night again appeared to him in a vision after matins, and
          said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Why did you tell Egbert so
          negligently and after so lukewarm a manner that which I enjoined
          upon you to say? Yet, go now and tell him, that whether he will or
          no, he must go <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page319">[pg
          319]</span><a name="Pg319" id="Pg319" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          to Columba's monasteries, because their ploughs are not driven
          straight; and he must bring them back into the right way.”</span>
          Hearing this, Egbert again charged the brother not to reveal the
          same to any man. Though now assured of the vision, he nevertheless
          attempted to set forth upon his intended voyage with the brethren.
          When they had put aboard all that was requisite for so long a
          voyage, and had waited some days for fair winds, there arose one
          night so violent a storm, that part of what was on board was lost,
          and the ship itself was left lying on its side in the sea.
          Nevertheless, all that belonged to Egbert and his companions was
          saved. Then he, saying, in the words of the prophet, <span class="tei tei-q">“For my sake this great tempest is upon
          you,”</span><a id="noteref_821" name="noteref_821" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_821"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">821</span></span></a>
          withdrew himself from that undertaking and was content to remain at
          home.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But one of his
          companions, called Wictbert,<a id="noteref_822" name="noteref_822" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_822"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">822</span></span></a>
          notable for his contempt of the world and for his learning and
          knowledge, for he had lived many years as a stranger and pilgrim in
          Ireland, leading a hermit's life in great perfection, took ship,
          and arriving in Frisland, preached the Word of salvation for the
          space of two whole years to that nation and to its king,
          Rathbed;<a id="noteref_823" name="noteref_823" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_823"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">823</span></span></a> but
          reaped no fruit of all his great labour among his barbarous
          hearers. Returning then to the chosen place of his pilgrimage, he
          gave himself up to the Lord in his wonted life of silence, and
          since he could not be profitable to strangers by teaching them the
          faith, he took care to be the more profitable to his own people by
          the example of his virtue.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the man of
          God, Egbert, perceived that neither he himself was permitted to go
          and preach to the nations, being withheld for the sake of some
          other advantage to the holy Church, whereof he had been forewarned
          by a revelation; nor that Wictbert, when he went into those parts,
          had availed to do anything; he nevertheless still attempted to send
          holy and industrious men to the work of the Word, among whom the
          most notable was Wilbrord,<a id="noteref_824" name="noteref_824" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_824"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">824</span></span></a> a man
          eminent for his merit and rank as priest. They arrived there,
          twelve in number, and turning aside to Pippin,<a id="noteref_825" name="noteref_825" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_825"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">825</span></span></a> duke
          of the Franks, were gladly received by him; and as he had lately
          subdued the nearer part of Frisland, and expelled King
          Rathbed,<a id="noteref_826" name="noteref_826" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_826"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">826</span></span></a> he
          sent them thither to preach, supporting them at the same time with
          his sovereign authority, that none might molest them in their
          preaching, and bestowing many favours on those who consented to
          receive the faith. Thus it came to pass, that with the help of the
          Divine grace, in a short time they converted many from idolatry to
          the faith of Christ.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Following their
          example, two other priests of the English nation, who had long
          lived as strangers in Ireland, for the sake of the eternal country,
          went into the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page321">[pg
          321]</span><a name="Pg321" id="Pg321" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          province of the Old Saxons, if haply they could there win any to
          Christ by their preaching. They were alike in name as in devotion,
          Hewald being the name of both, with this distinction, that, on
          account of the different colour of their hair, the one was called
          Black Hewald and the other White Hewald.<a id="noteref_827" name="noteref_827" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_827"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">827</span></span></a> They
          were both full of religious piety, but Black Hewald was the more
          learned of the two in Scripture. When they came into the province,
          these men took up their lodging in the guesthouse of a certain
          township-reeve, and asked of him that he would conduct them to the
          ealdorman<a id="noteref_828" name="noteref_828" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_828"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">828</span></span></a> who
          was over him, for that they had a message concerning matters of
          importance to communicate to him. For those Old Saxons have no
          king, but many ealdormen set over their nation; and when any war is
          on the point of breaking out, they cast lots indifferently, and on
          whomsoever the lot falls, him they all follow and obey during the
          time of war; but as soon as the war is ended, all those ealdormen
          are again equal in power. So the reeve received and entertained
          them in his house some days, promising to send them to the
          ealdorman who was over him, as they desired.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But when the
          barbarians perceived that they were of another religion,—for they
          continually gave themselves to singing of psalms and prayer, and
          daily offered up to God the Sacrifice of the saving Victim, having
          with them sacred vessels and a consecrated table for an altar,—they
          began to grow suspicious of them, lest if they should come into the
          presence of their ealdorman, and converse with him, they should
          turn his heart from their gods, and convert him to the new religion
          of the Christian <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page322">[pg
          322]</span><a name="Pg322" id="Pg322" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          faith; and thus by degrees all their province should be forced to
          change its old worship for a new. Wherefore on a sudden they laid
          hold of them and put them to death; and White Hewald they slew
          outright with the sword; but they put Black Hewald to lingering
          torture and tore him limb from limb in horrible fashion, and they
          threw their bodies into the Rhine. The ealdorman, whom they had
          desired to see, hearing of it, was very angry that strangers who
          desired to come to him had not been suffered to come; and therefore
          he sent and put to death all those villagers and burned their
          village. The aforesaid priests and servants of Christ suffered on
          the 3rd of October.<a id="noteref_829" name="noteref_829" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_829"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">829</span></span></a></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Miracles from
          Heaven were not lacking at their martyrdom. For their dead bodies,
          having been cast into the river by the pagans, as has been said,
          were carried against the stream for the space of almost forty
          miles, to the place where their companions were. Moreover, a long
          ray of light, reaching up to heaven, shone every night above them
          wheresoever they chanced to be, and that too in the sight of the
          very pagans that had slain them. Moreover, one of them appeared in
          a vision by night to one of his companions, whose name was Tilmon,
          a man of renown and of noble birth in this world, who having been a
          thegn had become a monk, telling him that he might find their
          bodies in that place, where he should see rays of light reaching
          from heaven to the earth. And so it befell; and their bodies being
          found, were buried with the honour due to martyrs; and the day of
          their passion or of the finding of their bodies, is celebrated in
          those parts with fitting veneration. Finally, Pippin, the most
          glorious duke of the Franks, learning these things, caused the
          bodies to be brought to him, and buried them with much honour in
          the church of the city of Cologne, on the Rhine.<a id="noteref_830" name="noteref_830" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_830"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">830</span></span></a> And
          it is said that a spring burst forth in the place where they were
          killed, which to this day affords a plentiful stream in that same
          place.</p>

          given him by the prince to preach there, he made haste to go to
          Rome, where Pope Sergius<a id="noteref_831" name="noteref_831" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_831"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">831</span></span></a> then
          presided over the Apostolic see, that he might undertake the
          desired work of preaching the Gospel to the nations, with his
          licence and blessing; and hoping to receive of him some relics of
          the blessed Apostles and martyrs of Christ; to the end, that when
          he destroyed the idols,<a id="noteref_832" name="noteref_832" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_832"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">832</span></span></a> and
          erected churches in the nation to which he preached, he might have
          the relics of saints at hand to put into them, and having deposited
          them there, might accordingly dedicate each of those places to the
          honour of the saint whose relics they were. He desired also there
          to learn or to receive many other things needful for so great a
          work. Having obtained his desire in all these matters, he returned
          to preach.</p>

          the brothers who were in Frisland, attending on the ministry of the

          ordained bishop for them. He, being sent into Britain, was
          consecrated, at their request, by the most reverend Bishop Wilfrid,
          who, having been driven out of his country, chanced then to be
          living in banishment among the Mercians;<a id="noteref_834" name="noteref_834" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_834"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">834</span></span></a> for
          Kent had no bishop at that time, Theodore being dead, and Bertwald,
          his successor, who had gone beyond the sea to be ordained, having
          not yet returned to his episcopal see.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page324">[pg 324]</span><a name="Pg324" id="Pg324" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          Suidbert, being made bishop, returned from Britain, and not long
          after departed to the Boructuari; and by his preaching brought many
          of them into the way of truth; but the Boructuari being not long
          after subdued by the Old Saxons, those who had received the Word
          were dispersed abroad; and the bishop himself with certain others
          went to Pippin, who, at the request of his wife, Blithryda,<a id="noteref_835" name="noteref_835" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_835"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">835</span></span></a> gave

          he built a monastery, which his successors still possess, and for a
          time dwelt in it, leading a most continent life, and there ended
          his days.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When they who
          had gone thither had spent some years teaching in Frisland, Pippin,
          with the consent of them all, sent the venerable Wilbrord to Rome,
          where Sergius was still pope, desiring that he might be consecrated
          archbishop over the nation of the Frisians; which was accordingly
          done, as he had made request, in the year of our Lord 696. He was

          the Northumbrians, rose from the dead, and related many things

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At this time a
          memorable miracle, and like to those of former days, was wrought in
          Britain; for, to the end that the living might be roused from the
          death of the soul, a certain man, who had been some time dead, rose
          again to the life of the body, and related many memorable things
          that he had seen; some of which I have thought fit here briefly to
          describe. There was a certain householder in that district of the
          Northumbrians which is called Incuneningum,<a id="noteref_841" name="noteref_841" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_841"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">841</span></span></a> who
          led a godly life, with all his house. This man fell sick, and his
          sickness daily increasing, he was brought to extremity, and died in
          the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page326">[pg 326]</span><a name="Pg326" id="Pg326" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> beginning of the
          night; but at dawn he came to life again, and suddenly sat up,
          whereat all those that sat about the body weeping fled away in
          great terror, only his wife, who loved him better, though trembling
          and greatly afraid, remained with him. And he comforting her, said,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Fear not, for I am now in very deed risen
          from death whereof I was holden, and permitted again to live among
          men; nevertheless, hereafter I must not live as I was wont, but
          after a very different manner.”</span> Then rising immediately, he
          went to the oratory of the little town, and continuing in prayer
          till day, forthwith divided all his substance into three parts; one
          whereof he gave to his wife, another to his children, and the
          third, which he kept himself, he straightway distributed among the
          poor. Not long after, being set free from the cares of this world,
          he came to the monastery of Mailros,<a id="noteref_842" name="noteref_842" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_842"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">842</span></span></a> which
          is almost enclosed by the winding of the river Tweed, and having
          received the tonsure, went apart into a place of abode which the
          abbot had provided, and there he continued till the day of his
          death, in so great contrition of mind and mortifying of the body,
          that even if his tongue had been silent, his life would have
          declared that he had seen many things either to be dreaded or
          coveted, which were hidden from other men.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus he related
          what he had seen.<a id="noteref_843" name="noteref_843" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_843"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">843</span></span></a>
          <span class="tei tei-q">“He that led me had a countenance full of
          light, and shining raiment, and we went in silence, as it seemed to
          me, towards the rising of the summer sun. And as we walked we came
          to a broad and deep valley of infinite length; it lay on our left,
          and one side of it was exceeding terrible with raging flames, the
          other no less intolerable for violent hail and cold snows drifting
          and sweeping through all the place. Both sides were full of the
          souls of men which seemed to be tossed from one side to the other
          as it were by a violent storm; for when they could no longer endure
          the fervent heat, the hapless souls leaped <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page327">[pg 327]</span><a name="Pg327" id="Pg327" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> into the midst of the deadly cold; and
          finding no rest there, they leaped back again to be burnt in the
          midst of the unquenchable flames. Now whereas an innumerable
          multitude of misshapen spirits were thus tormented far and near
          with this interchange of misery, as far as I could see, without any
          interval of rest, I began to think that peradventure this might be
          Hell, of whose intolerable torments I had often heard men talk. My
          guide, who went before me, answered to my thought, saying,
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘Think not so, for this is not the Hell you
          believe it to be.’</span></span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“When he had led me farther by degrees, sore dismayed
          by that dread sight, on a sudden I saw the place before us begin to
          grow dark and filled with shadows. When we entered into them, the
          shadows by degrees grew so thick, that I could see nothing else,
          save only the darkness and the shape and garment of him that led
          me. As we went on <span class="tei tei-q">‘through the shades in
          the lone night,’</span><a id="noteref_844" name="noteref_844" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_844"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">844</span></span></a> lo!
          on a sudden there appeared before us masses of foul flame
          constantly rising as it were out of a great pit, and falling back
          again into the same. When I had been led thither, my guide suddenly
          vanished, and left me alone in the midst of darkness and these
          fearful sights. As those same masses of fire, without intermission,
          at one time flew up and at another fell back into the bottom of the
          abyss, I perceived that the summits of all the flames, as they
          ascended were full of the spirits of men, which, like sparks flying
          upwards with the smoke, were sometimes thrown on high, and again,
          when the vapours of the fire fell, dropped down into the depths
          below. Moreover, a stench, foul beyond compare, burst forth with
          the vapours, and filled all those dark places.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Having stood there a long time in much dread, not
          knowing what to do, which way to turn, or what end awaited me, on a
          sudden I heard behind me the sound of a mighty and miserable
          lamentation, and at the same time noisy laughter, as of a rude
          multitude insulting captured enemies. When that noise, growing
          plainer, came up to me, I beheld a crowd of evil spirits dragging
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page328">[pg 328]</span><a name="Pg328" id="Pg328" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> five souls of men,
          wailing and shrieking, into the midst of the darkness, whilst they
          themselves exulted and laughed. Among those human souls, as I could
          discern, there was one shorn like a clerk, one a layman, and one a
          woman. The evil spirits that dragged them went down into the midst
          of the burning pit; and it came to pass that as they went down
          deeper, I could no longer distinguish between the lamentation of
          the men and the laughing of the devils, yet I still had a confused
          sound in my ears. In the meantime, some of the dark spirits
          ascended from that flaming abyss, and running forward, beset me on
          all sides, and with their flaming eyes and the noisome fire which
          they breathed forth from their mouths and nostrils, tried to choke
          me; and threatened to lay hold on me with fiery tongs, which they
          had in their hands, yet they durst in no wise touch me, though they
          assayed to terrify me. Being thus on all sides encompassed with
          enemies and shades of darkness, and casting my eyes hither and
          thither if haply anywhere help might be found whereby I might be
          saved, there appeared behind me, on the way by which I had come, as
          it were, the brightness of a star shining amidst the darkness;
          which waxing greater by degrees, came rapidly towards me: and when
          it drew near, all those evil spirits, that sought to carry me away
          with their tongs, dispersed and fled.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Now he, whose approach put them to flight, was the
          same that led me before; who, then turning towards the right, began
          to lead me, as it were, towards the rising of the winter sun, and
          having soon brought me out of the darkness, led me forth into an
          atmosphere of clear light. While he thus led me in open light, I
          saw a vast wall before us, the length on either side, and the
          height whereof, seemed to be altogether boundless. I began to
          wonder why we went up to the wall, seeing no door in it, nor
          window, nor any way of ascent. But when we came to the wall, we
          were presently, I know not by what means, on the top of it, and lo!
          there was a wide and pleasant plain full of such fragrance of
          blooming flowers that the marvellous sweetness of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page329">[pg 329]</span><a name="Pg329" id="Pg329" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> scents immediately dispelled the foul
          stench of the dark furnace which had filled my nostrils. So great
          was the light shed over all this place that it seemed to exceed the
          brightness of the day, or the rays of the noontide sun. In this
          field were innumerable companies of men clothed in white, and many
          seats of rejoicing multitudes. As he led me through the midst of
          bands of happy inhabitants, I began to think that this perchance
          might be the kingdom of Heaven, of which I had often heard tell. He
          answered to my thought, saying, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Nay, this
          is not the kingdom of Heaven, as you think.’</span></span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“When we had also passed those mansions of blessed
          spirits, and gone farther on, I saw before me a much more beautiful
          light than before, and therein heard sweet sounds of singing, and
          so wonderful a fragrance was shed abroad from the place, that the
          other which I had perceived before and thought so great, then
          seemed to me but a small thing; even as that wondrous brightness of
          the flowery field, compared with this which I now beheld, appeared
          mean and feeble. When I began to hope that we should enter that
          delightful place, my guide, on a sudden stood still; and
          straightway turning, led me back by the way we came.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“In our return, when we came to those joyous mansions
          of the white-robed spirits, he said to me, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Do you know what all these things are which you have
          seen?’</span> I answered, <span class="tei tei-q">‘No,’</span> and
          then he said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘That valley which you beheld
          terrible with flaming fire and freezing cold, is the place in which
          the souls of those are tried and punished, who, delaying to confess
          and amend their crimes, at length have recourse to repentance at
          the point of death, and so go forth from the body; but nevertheless
          because they, even at their death, confessed and repented, they
          shall all be received into the kingdom of Heaven at the day of
          judgement; but many are succoured before the day of judgement, by
          the prayers of the living and their alms and fasting, and more
          especially by the celebration of Masses. Moreover that foul flaming
          pit which you saw, is the mouth of Hell, into which whosoever falls
          shall never be delivered to all eternity. This <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page330">[pg 330]</span><a name="Pg330" id="Pg330" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> flowery place, in which you see this
          fair and youthful company, all bright and joyous, is that into
          which the souls of those are received who, indeed, when they leave
          the body have done good works, but who are not so perfect as to
          deserve to be immediately admitted into the kingdom of Heaven; yet
          they shall all, at the day of judgement, behold Christ, and enter
          into the joys of His kingdom; for such as are perfect in every word
          and deed and thought, as soon as they quit the body, forthwith
          enter into the kingdom of Heaven; in the neighbourhood whereof that
          place is, where you heard the sound of sweet singing amidst the
          savour of a sweet fragrance and brightness of light. As for you,
          who must now return to the body, and again live among men, if you
          will seek diligently to examine your actions, and preserve your
          manner of living and your words in righteousness and simplicity,
          you shall, after death, have a place of abode among these joyful
          troops of blessed souls which you behold. For when I left you for
          awhile, it was for this purpose, that I might learn what should
          become of you.’</span> When he had said this to me, I much abhorred
          returning to the body, being delighted with the sweetness and
          beauty of the place which I beheld, and with the company of those I
          saw in it. Nevertheless, I durst not ask my guide anything; but
          thereupon, on a sudden, I found myself, I know not how, alive among
          men.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now these and
          other things which this man of God had seen, he would not relate to
          slothful men, and such as lived negligently; but only to those who,
          being terrified with the dread of torments, or ravished with the
          hope of everlasting joys, would draw from his words the means to
          advance in piety. In the neighbourhood of his cell lived one
          Haemgils, a monk, and eminent in the priesthood, whose good works
          were worthy of his office: he is still living, and leading a
          solitary life in Ireland, supporting his declining age with coarse
          bread and cold water. He often went to that man, and by repeated
          questioning, heard of him what manner of things he had seen when
          out of the body; by whose account those few particulars which we
          have briefly set down came also to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page331">[pg 331]</span><a name="Pg331" id="Pg331" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> our knowledge. And he related his visions to
          King Aldfrid,<a id="noteref_845" name="noteref_845" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_845"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">845</span></span></a> a man
          most learned in all respects, and was by him so willingly and
          attentively heard, that at his request he was admitted into the
          monastery above-mentioned, and received the crown of the monastic
          tonsure; and the said king, whensoever he came into those parts,
          very often went to hear him. At that time the abbot and priest
          Ethelwald,<a id="noteref_846" name="noteref_846" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_846"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">846</span></span></a> a man
          of godly and sober life, presided over that monastery. He now
          occupies the episcopal see of the church of Lindisfarne, leading a
          life worthy of his degree.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He had a place
          of abode assigned him apart in that monastery, where he might give
          himself more freely to the service of his Creator in continual
          prayer. And inasmuch as that place was on the banks of the river,
          he was wont often to go into the same for the great desire he had
          to do penance in his body, and oftentimes to plunge in it, and to
          continue saying psalms or prayers in the same as long as he could
          endure it, standing still, while the waves flowed over him,
          sometimes up to the middle, and sometimes even to the neck in
          water; and when he went ashore, he never took off his cold, wet
          garments till they grew warm and dry on his body. And when in the
          winter the cracking pieces of ice were floating about him, which he
          had himself sometimes broken, to make room to stand or plunge in
          the river, and those who beheld it would say, <span class="tei tei-q">“We marvel, brother Drythelm (for so he was called),
          that you are able to endure such severe cold;”</span> he answered
          simply, for he was a simple and sober-spirited man, <span class="tei tei-q">“I have seen greater cold.”</span> And when they said,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“We marvel that you choose to observe so
          hard a rule of continence,”</span> he <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page332">[pg 332]</span><a name="Pg332" id="Pg332" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> replied, <span class="tei tei-q">“I have seen
          harder things.”</span> And so, until the day of his calling hence,
          in his unwearied desire of heavenly bliss, he subdued his aged body
          with daily fasting, and forwarded the salvation of many by his
          words and life.</p>

          there was a man in the province of the Mercians, whose visions and
          words, but not his manner of life, were of profit to others, though
          not to himself. In the reign of Coenred,<a id="noteref_847" name="noteref_847" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_847"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">847</span></span></a> who
          succeeded Ethelred, there was a layman who was a king's thegn, no
          less acceptable to the king for his outward industry, than
          displeasing to him for his neglect of his own soul. The king
          diligently admonished him to confess and amend, and to forsake his
          evil ways, lest he should lose all time for repentance and
          amendment by a sudden death. But though frequently warned, he
          despised the words of salvation, and promised that he would do
          penance at some future time. In the meantime, falling sick he
          betook himself to his bed, and was tormented with grievous pains.
          The king coming to him (for he loved the man much) exhorted him,
          even then, before death, to repent of his offences. But he answered
          that he would not then confess his sins, but would do it when he
          was recovered of his sickness, lest his companions should upbraid
          him with having done that for fear of death, which he had refused
          to do in health. He thought he spoke very bravely, but it
          afterwards appeared that he had been miserably deceived by the
          wiles of the Devil.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The disease
          increasing, when the king came again to visit and instruct him, he
          cried out straightway with a lamentable voice, <span class="tei tei-q">“What will you now? What are you <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page333">[pg 333]</span><a name="Pg333" id="Pg333" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> come for? for you can no longer do
          aught for my profit or salvation.”</span> The king answered,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Say not so; take heed and be of sound
          mind.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“I am not mad,”</span>
          replied he, <span class="tei tei-q">“but I now know the worst and
          have it for certain before my eyes.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“What is that?”</span> said the king. <span class="tei tei-q">“Not long since,”</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“there came into this room two fair youths, and sat
          down by me, the one at my head, and the other at my feet. One of
          them drew forth a book most beautiful, but very small, and gave it
          me to read; looking into it, I there found all the good actions I
          had ever done in my life written down, and they were very few and
          inconsiderable. They took back the book and said nothing to me.
          Then, on a sudden, appeared an army of evil spirits of hideous
          countenance, and they beset this house without, and sitting down
          filled the greater part of it within. Then he, who by the blackness
          of his gloomy face, and his sitting above the rest, seemed to be
          the chief of them, taking out a book terrible to behold, of a
          monstrous size, and of almost insupportable weight, commanded one
          of his followers to bring it to me to read. Having read it, I found
          therein most plainly written in hideous characters, all the crimes
          I ever committed, not only in word and deed, but even in the least
          thought; and he said to those glorious men in white raiment who sat
          by me, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Why sit ye here, since ye know of a
          surety that this man is ours?’</span> They answered, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Ye speak truly; take him and lead him away to fill up
          the measure of your damnation.’</span> This said, they forthwith
          vanished, and two wicked spirits arose, having in their hands
          ploughshares, and one of them struck me on the head, and the other
          on the foot. And these ploughshares are now with great torment
          creeping into the inward parts of my body, and as soon as they meet
          I shall die, and the devils being ready to snatch me away, I shall
          be dragged into the dungeons of hell.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus spoke that
          wretch in his despair, and soon after died, and now in vain suffers
          in eternal torments that penance which he failed to suffer for a
          short time with the fruits of forgiveness. Of whom it is manifest,
          that (as the blessed Pope Gregory writes of certain persons)
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page334">[pg 334]</span><a name="Pg334" id="Pg334" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> he did not see these
          things for his own sake, since they did not avail him, but for the
          sake of others, who, knowing of his end, should be afraid to put
          off the time of repentance, whilst they have leisure, lest, being
          prevented by sudden death, they should perish impenitent. And
          whereas he saw diverse books laid before him by the good and evil
          spirits, this was done by Divine dispensation, that we may keep in
          mind that our deeds and thoughts are not scattered to the winds,
          but are all kept to be examined by the Supreme Judge, and will in
          the end be shown us either by friendly angels or by the enemy. And
          whereas the angels first drew forth a white book, and then the
          devils a black one; the former a very small one, the latter one
          very great; it is to be observed, that in his first years he did
          some good actions, all which he nevertheless obscured by the evil
          actions of his youth. If, contrarywise, he had taken care in his
          youth to correct the errors of his boyhood, and by well-doing to
          put them away from the sight of God, he might have been admitted to
          the fellowship of those of whom the Psalm says, <span class="tei tei-q">“Blessed are those whose iniquities are forgiven, and
          whose sins are covered.”</span><a id="noteref_848" name="noteref_848" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_848"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">848</span></span></a> This

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I myself knew a
          brother, would to God I had not known him, whose name I could
          mention if it were of any avail, dwelling in a famous monastery,
          but himself living infamously. He was oftentimes rebuked by the
          brethren and elders of the place, and admonished to be converted to
          a more chastened life; and though he would not give ear to them,
          they bore with him long and patiently, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page335">[pg 335]</span><a name="Pg335" id="Pg335" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> on account of their need of his outward
          service, for he was a cunning artificer. But he was much given to
          drunkenness, and other pleasures of a careless life, and more used
          to stop in his workshop day and night, than to go to church to sing
          and pray and hear the Word of life with the brethren. For which
          reason it befell him according to the saying, that he who will not
          willingly humble himself and enter the gate of the church must
          needs be led against his will into the gate of Hell, being damned.
          For he falling sick, and being brought to extremity, called the
          brethren, and with much lamentation, like one damned, began to tell
          them, that he saw Hell opened, and Satan sunk in the depths
          thereof; and Caiaphas, with the others that slew our Lord, hard by
          him, delivered up to avenging flames. <span class="tei tei-q">“In
          whose neighbourhood,”</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“I
          see a place of eternal perdition prepared for me, miserable wretch
          that I am.”</span> The brothers, hearing these words, began
          diligently to exhort him, that he should repent even then, whilst
          he was still in the flesh. He answered in despair, <span class="tei tei-q">“There is no time for me now to change my course of
          life, when I have myself seen my judgement passed.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whilst uttering
          these words, he died without having received the saving Viaticum,
          and his body was buried in the farthest parts of the monastery, nor
          did any one dare either to say Masses or sing psalms, or even to
          pray for him.<a id="noteref_850" name="noteref_850" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_850"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">850</span></span></a> Oh
          how far asunder hath God put light from darkness! The blessed
          Stephen, the first martyr, being about to suffer death for the
          truth, saw the heavens opened, and the glory of God, and Jesus
          standing on the right hand of God;<a id="noteref_851" name="noteref_851" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_851"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">851</span></span></a> and
          where he was to be after death, there he fixed the eyes of his
          mind, that he might die the more joyfully. But this workman, of
          darkened mind and life, when death was at hand, saw Hell opened,
          and witnessed the damnation of the Devil and his followers; he saw
          also, unhappy wretch! his own prison among them, to the end that,
          despairing of salvation, he might himself die the more miserably,
          but might by his perdition <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page336">[pg 336]</span><a name="Pg336" id="Pg336" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> afford cause of salvation to the living who
          should hear of it. This befell of late in the province of the
          Bernicians, and being noised abroad far and near, inclined many to
          do penance for their sins without delay. Would to God that this
          also might come to pass through the reading of our words!</p>

          abode some time in that province, and saw the canonical rites of
          the Church. Moreover, he was earnestly admonished by many of the
          more learned sort, not to presume to live contrary to the universal
          custom of the Church, either in regard to the observance of Easter,
          or any other ordinances whatsoever, with those few followers of his
          dwelling in the farthest corner of the world. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page337">[pg 337]</span><a name="Pg337" id="Pg337" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Wherefore he so changed his mind, that
          he readily preferred those things which he had seen and heard in
          the English churches, to the customs which he and his people had
          hitherto followed. For he was a good and wise man, and excellently
          instructed in knowledge of the Scriptures. Returning home, he
          endeavoured to bring his own people that were in Hii, or that were
          subject to that monastery, into the way of truth, which he had
          embraced with all his heart; but he could not prevail. He sailed
          over into Ireland,<a id="noteref_856" name="noteref_856" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_856"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">856</span></span></a> and
          preaching to those people, and with sober words of exhortation
          making known to them the lawful time of Easter, he brought back
          many of them, and almost all that were free from the dominion of
          those of Hii, from the error of their fathers to the Catholic
          unity, and taught them to keep the lawful time of Easter.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Returning to his
          island, after having celebrated the canonical Easter in Ireland, he
          was instant in preaching the Catholic observance of the season of
          Easter in his monastery, yet without being able to achieve his end;
          and it so happened that he departed this life before the next year
          came round,<a id="noteref_857" name="noteref_857" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_857"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">857</span></span></a> the
          Divine goodness so ordaining it, that as he was a great lover of
          peace and unity, he should be taken away to everlasting life before
          he should be obliged, on the return of the season of Easter, to be
          at greater variance with those that would not follow him into the
          truth.</p>

          wrote a book concerning the holy places, of great profit to many

          bishop of Gaul,<a id="noteref_858" name="noteref_858" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_858"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">858</span></span></a> who

          Promised Land, travelled also to Damascus, Constantinople,
          Alexandria, and many islands in the sea, and returning home by
          ship, was cast upon the western coast of Britain by a great
          tempest. After many adventures he came to the aforesaid servant of
          Christ, Adamnan, and being found to be learned in the Scriptures,
          and acquainted with the holy places, was most gladly received by
          him and gladly heard, insomuch that whatsoever he said that he had
          seen worthy of remembrance in the holy places, Adamnan straightway
          set himself to commit to writing. Thus he composed a work, as I
          have said, profitable to many, and chiefly to those who, being far
          removed from those places where the patriarchs and Apostles lived,
          know no more of them than what they have learnt by reading. Adamnan
          presented this book to King Aldfrid, and through his bounty it came
          to be read by lesser persons.<a id="noteref_859" name="noteref_859" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_859"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">859</span></span></a> The

          Lord's Cross, a crypt is hewn out of the rock, in which the
          Sacrifice is offered on an altar for the dead that are held in
          honour, their bodies remaining meanwhile in the street. To the
          westward of this church is the round church of the Anastasis or
          Resurrection of our Lord, encompassed with three walls, and
          supported by twelve columns. Between each of the walls is a broad
          passage, which contains three altars at three different points of
          the middle wall; to the south, the north, and the west. It has
          eight doors or entrances in a straight line through the three
          walls; four whereof face the south-east, and four the east.<a id="noteref_862" name="noteref_862" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_862"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">862</span></span></a> In
          the midst of it is the round tomb of our Lord cut out of the rock,
          the top of of which a man standing within can touch with his hand;
          on the east is the entrance, against which that great stone was
          set. To this day the tomb bears the marks of the iron tools within,
          but on the outside it is all covered with marble to the very top of
          the roof, which is adorned with gold, and bears a large golden
          cross. In the north <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page340">[pg

          rock, seven feet in length, and three hand-breadths above the
          floor; the entrance being on the south side, where twelve lamps
          burn day and night, four within the sepulchre, and eight above on
          the edge of the right side. The stone that was set at the entrance
          to the tomb is now cleft in two; nevertheless, the lesser part of
          it stands as an altar of hewn stone before the door of the tomb;
          the greater part is set up as another altar, four-cornered, at the
          east end of the same church, and is covered with linen cloths. The

          together.”</span><a id="noteref_863" name="noteref_863" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_863"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">863</span></span></a></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Concerning the
          place of our Lord's Ascension, the aforesaid author writes thus.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“The Mount of Olives is equal in height to
          Mount Sion, but exceeds it in breadth and length; it bears few
          trees besides vines and olives, and is fruitful in wheat and
          barley, for the nature of that soil is not such as to yield
          thickets,<a id="noteref_864" name="noteref_864" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_864"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">864</span></span></a> but
          grass and flowers. On the very top of it, where our Lord ascended
          into heaven, is a large round church,<a id="noteref_865" name="noteref_865" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_865"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">865</span></span></a>
          having round about it <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page341">[pg
          341]</span><a name="Pg341" id="Pg341" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          three chapels with vaulted roofs. For the inner building could not
          be vaulted and roofed, by reason of the passage of our Lord's Body;
          but it has an altar on the east side, sheltered by a narrow roof.
          In the midst of it are to be seen the last Footprints of our Lord,
          the place where He ascended being open to the sky; and though the
          earth is daily carried away by believers, yet still it remains, and
          retains the same appearance, being marked by the impression of the
          Feet. Round about these lies a brazen wheel, as high as a man's
          neck, having an entrance from the west, with a great lamp hanging
          above it on a pulley and burning night and day. In the western part
          of the same church are eight windows; and as many lamps, hanging
          opposite to them by cords, shine through the glass as far as
          Jerusalem; and the light thereof is said to thrill the hearts of
          the beholders with a certain zeal and compunction. Every year, on
          the day of the Ascension of our Lord, when Mass is ended, a strong
          blast of wind is wont to come down, and to cast to the ground all
          that are in the church.”</span></p>

          encompassed with a wall four-square, their heads lying to the
          north. Each of the tombs is covered with a single stone, hewn like
          the stones of a church, and of a white colour, for the three
          patriarchs. Adam's is of meaner and poorer workmanship, and he lies
          not far from them at the farthest end of the northern part of that

          departed to the heavenly life; for he was a good man and a just,
          and his life and doctrine as a bishop were guided rather by his
          innate love of virtue, than by what he had gained from books. The
          most <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page343">[pg 343]</span><a name="Pg343" id="Pg343" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> reverend bishop,

          wont to relate that many miracles of healing have been wrought in
          the place where he died, through the merit of his sanctity; and
          that the men of that province used to carry the dust thence for the
          sick, and put it into water, and the drinking thereof, or
          sprinkling with it, brought health to many sick men and beasts; so
          that the holy dust being frequently carried away, a great hole was

          well in matters touching the Church as in the knowledge of the
          Scriptures. Aldhelm, when he was as yet only a priest and abbot of
          the monastery which is called the city of Maildufus,<a id="noteref_874" name="noteref_874" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_874"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">874</span></span></a> by

          against the error of the Britons, in not celebrating Easter at the
          due time, and in doing divers other things contrary to the purity
          of doctrine and the peace of the church; and through the reading of
          this book many of the Britons, who were subject to the West Saxons,
          were led by him to adopt the Catholic celebration of our Lord's
          Paschal Feast. He likewise wrote a famous book on Virginity,<a id="noteref_876" name="noteref_876" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_876"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">876</span></span></a>

          composed in twofold form, in hexameters and in prose. He wrote some
          other books, being a man most instructed in all respects, for he
          had a polished style,<a id="noteref_878" name="noteref_878" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_878"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">878</span></span></a> and
          was, as I have said, of marvellous learning both in liberal and
          ecclesiastical studies. On his death, Forthere<a id="noteref_879" name="noteref_879" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_879"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">879</span></span></a>

          he had been bishop forty-five years.<a id="noteref_890" name="noteref_890" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_890"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">890</span></span></a> His
          body, being laid in a coffin, was carried to his monastery, which
          is called Inhrypum,<a id="noteref_891" name="noteref_891" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_891"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">891</span></span></a> and
          buried in the church of the blessed Apostle Peter, with the honour
          due to so great a prelate. Concerning whose manner of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page347">[pg 347]</span><a name="Pg347" id="Pg347" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> life, let us now turn back, and briefly
          make mention of the things which were done.<a id="noteref_892" name="noteref_892" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_892"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">892</span></span></a> Being
          a boy of a good disposition, and virtuous beyond his years, he
          conducted himself so modestly and discreetly in all points, that he
          was deservedly beloved, respected, and cherished by his elders as
          one of themselves.<a id="noteref_893" name="noteref_893" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_893"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">893</span></span></a> At
          fourteen years of age he chose rather the monastic than the secular
          life; which, when he had signified to his father, for his mother
          was dead, he readily consented to his godly wishes and desires, and
          advised him to persist in that wholesome purpose. Wherefore he came
          to the isle of Lindisfarne, and there giving himself to the service
          of the monks, he strove diligently to learn and to practise those
          things which belong to monastic purity and piety; and being of a
          ready wit, he speedily learned the psalms and some other books,
          having not yet received the tonsure, but being in no small measure
          marked by those virtues of humility and obedience which are more
          important than the tonsure; for which reason he was justly loved by
          his elders and his equals. Having served God some years in that
          monastery, and being a youth of a good understanding, he perceived
          that the way of virtue delivered by the Scots was in no wise
          perfect, and he resolved to go to Rome, to see what ecclesiastical
          or monastic rites were in use at the Apostolic see. When he told
          the brethren, they commended his design, and advised him to carry
          out that which he purposed. He forthwith went to Queen Eanfled, for
          he was known to her, and it was by her counsel and support that he
          had been admitted into the aforesaid monastery, and he told her of
          his desire to visit the threshold of the blessed Apostles. She,
          being pleased with the youth's good purpose, sent <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page348">[pg 348]</span><a name="Pg348" id="Pg348" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> him into Kent, to King
          Earconbert,<a id="noteref_894" name="noteref_894" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_894"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">894</span></span></a> who
          was her uncle's son, requesting that he would send him to Rome in
          an honourable manner. At that time, Honorius,<a id="noteref_895" name="noteref_895" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_895"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">895</span></span></a> one
          of the disciples of the blessed Pope Gregory, a man very highly
          instructed in ecclesiastical learning, was archbishop there. When
          he had tarried there for a space, and, being a youth of an active
          spirit, was diligently applying himself to learn those things which
          came under his notice, another youth, called Biscop, surnamed
          Benedict,<a id="noteref_896" name="noteref_896" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_896"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">896</span></span></a> of
          the English nobility, arrived there, being likewise desirous to go
          to Rome, of whom we have before made mention.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The king gave
          him Wilfrid for a companion, and bade Wilfrid conduct him to Rome.
          When they came to Lyons, Wilfrid was detained there by
          Dalfinus,<a id="noteref_897" name="noteref_897" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_897"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">897</span></span></a> the
          bishop of that city; but Benedict hastened on to Rome. For the
          bishop was delighted with the youth's prudent discourse, the grace
          of his comely countenance, his eager activity, and the consistency
          and maturity of his thoughts; for which reason he plentifully
          supplied him and his companions with all necessaries, as long as
          they stayed with him; and further offered, if he would have it, to
          commit to him the government of no small part of Gaul, to give him
          a maiden daughter of his own brother<a id="noteref_898" name="noteref_898" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_898"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">898</span></span></a> to
          wife, and to regard him always as his adopted son. But Wilfrid
          thanked him for the loving-kindness which he was pleased to show to
          a stranger, and answered, that he had resolved upon another course
          of life, and for that reason had left his country and set out for
          Rome.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Hereupon the
          bishop sent him to Rome, furnishing him with a guide and supplying
          plenty of all things requisite for his journey, earnestly
          requesting that he would come that way, when he returned into his
          own <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page349">[pg 349]</span><a name="Pg349" id="Pg349" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> country. Wilfrid
          arriving at Rome, and daily giving himself with all earnestness to
          prayer and the study of ecclesiastical matters, as he had purposed
          in his mind, gained the friendship of the most holy and learned
          Boniface, the archdeacon,<a id="noteref_899" name="noteref_899" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_899"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">899</span></span></a> who
          was also counsellor to the Apostolic Pope, by whose instruction he
          learned in their order the four Gospels, and the true computation
          of Easter; and many other things appertaining to ecclesiastical
          discipline, which he could not learn in his own country, he
          acquired from the teaching of that same master. When he had spent
          some months there, in successful study, he returned into Gaul, to
          Dalfinus;<a id="noteref_900" name="noteref_900" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_900"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">900</span></span></a> and
          having stayed with him three years, received from him the tonsure,
          and Dalfinus esteemed him so highly in love that he had thoughts of
          making him his heir; but this was prevented by the bishop's cruel
          death, and Wilfrid was reserved to be a bishop of his own, that is,
          the English, nation. For Queen Baldhild<a id="noteref_901" name="noteref_901" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_901"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">901</span></span></a> sent
          soldiers with orders to put the bishop to death; whom Wilfrid, as
          his clerk, attended to the place where he was to be beheaded, being
          very desirous, though the bishop strongly opposed it, to die with
          him; but the executioners, understanding that he was a stranger,
          and of the English nation, spared him, and would not put him to
          death with his bishop.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page350">[pg
          350]</span><a name="Pg350" id="Pg350" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Returning to
          Britain, he won the friendship of King Alchfrid,<a id="noteref_902" name="noteref_902" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_902"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">902</span></span></a> who
          had learnt to follow always and love the catholic rules of the
          Church; and therefore finding him to be a Catholic, he gave him
          presently land of ten families at the place called Stanford;<a id="noteref_903" name="noteref_903" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_903"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">903</span></span></a> and
          not long after, the monastery, with land of thirty families, at the
          place called Inhrypum;<a id="noteref_904" name="noteref_904" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_904"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">904</span></span></a> which
          place he had formerly given to those that followed the doctrine of
          the Scots, to build a monastery there. But, forasmuch as they
          afterwards, being given the choice, had rather quit the place than
          adopt the Catholic Easter and other canonical rites, according to
          the custom of the Roman Apostolic Church, he gave the same to him
          whom he found to be instructed in better discipline and better
          customs.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the same
          time, by the said king's command, he was ordained priest in the
          same monastery, by Agilbert,<a id="noteref_905" name="noteref_905" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_905"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">905</span></span></a>
          bishop of the Gewissae above-mentioned, the king being desirous
          that a man of so much learning and piety should attend him
          constantly as his special priest and teacher; and not long after,
          when the Scottish sect had been exposed and banished,<a id="noteref_906" name="noteref_906" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_906"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">906</span></span></a> as
          was said above, he, with the advice and consent of his father Oswy,
          sent him into Gaul, to be consecrated as his bishop,<a id="noteref_907" name="noteref_907" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_907"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">907</span></span></a> when
          he was about thirty years of age, the same Agilbert being then
          bishop of the city of Paris. Eleven other bishops met at the
          consecration of the new bishop, and that function was most
          honourably performed. Whilst he yet tarried beyond the sea, the
          holy man, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page351">[pg
          351]</span><a name="Pg351" id="Pg351" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          Ceadda,<a id="noteref_908" name="noteref_908" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_908"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">908</span></span></a> was
          consecrated bishop of York<a id="noteref_909" name="noteref_909" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_909"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">909</span></span></a> by
          command of King Oswy, as has been said above; and having nobly
          ruled that church three years, he retired to take charge of his
          monastery of Laestingaeu, and Wilfrid was made bishop of all the
          province of the Northumbrians.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Afterwards, in
          the reign of Egfrid, he was expelled from his bishopric, and others
          were consecrated bishops in his stead, of whom mention has been
          made above.<a id="noteref_910" name="noteref_910" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_910"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">910</span></span></a>
          Designing to go to Rome, to plead his cause before the Apostolic
          Pope, he took ship, and was driven by a west wind into
          Frisland,<a id="noteref_911" name="noteref_911" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_911"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">911</span></span></a> and
          honourably received by that barbarous people and their King
          Aldgils, to whom he preached Christ, and he instructed many
          thousands of them in the Word of truth, washing them from the
          defilement of their sins in the Saviour's font. Thus he began there
          the work of the Gospel which was afterwards finished with great
          devotion by the most reverend bishop of Christ, Wilbrord.<a id="noteref_912" name="noteref_912" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_912"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">912</span></span></a>
          Having spent the winter there successfully among this new people of
          God, he set out again on his way to Rome,<a id="noteref_913" name="noteref_913" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_913"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">913</span></span></a> where
          his cause being <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page352">[pg
          352]</span><a name="Pg352" id="Pg352" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          tried before Pope Agatho and many bishops,<a id="noteref_914" name="noteref_914" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_914"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">914</span></span></a> he
          was by the judgement of them all acquitted of all blame, and
          declared worthy of his bishopric.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the same
          time, the said Pope Agatho assembling a synod at Rome, of one
          hundred and twenty-five bishops, against those who asserted that
          there was only one will and operation in our Lord and
          Saviour,<a id="noteref_915" name="noteref_915" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_915"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">915</span></span></a>
          ordered Wilfrid also to be summoned, and, sitting among the
          bishops, to declare his own faith and the faith of the province or
          island whence he came; and he and his people being found orthodox
          in their faith, it was thought fit to record the same among the
          acts of that synod, which was done in in this manner: <span class="tei tei-q">“Wilfrid, the beloved of God, bishop of the city of
          York, appealing to the Apostolic see, and being by that authority
          acquitted of every thing, whether specified against him or not, and
          being appointed to sit in judgement with one hundred and
          twenty-five other bishops in the synod, made confession of the true
          and catholic faith, and confirmed the same with his subscription in
          the name of all the northern part of Britain and Ireland, and the
          islands inhabited by the nations of the English and Britons, as
          also by the Scots and Picts.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After this,
          returning into Britain,<a id="noteref_916" name="noteref_916" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_916"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">916</span></span></a> he

          in the second year of Aldfrid, who reigned after Egfrid, was

          Nevertheless, five years after, being again accused, he was

          was much forwarded by the reading of the acts of the synod of Pope
          Agatho,<a id="noteref_924" name="noteref_924" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_924"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">924</span></span></a> of
          blessed memory, which had been formerly held, when Wilfrid was in
          Rome and sat in council among the bishops, as has been said before.
          For the acts of that synod being, as the case required, read, by
          order of the Apostolic Pope, before the nobility and a great number
          of the people for some days, they came to the place where it was
          written, <span class="tei tei-q">“Wilfrid, the beloved of God,
          bishop of the city of York, appealing to the Apostolic see, and
          being by that authority acquitted of everything, whether specified
          against him or not,”</span> and the rest as above stated. This
          being read, the hearers were amazed, and the reader ceasing, they
          began to ask of one another, who that Bishop Wilfrid was. Then
          Boniface, the Pope's counsellor,<a id="noteref_925" name="noteref_925" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_925"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">925</span></span></a> and
          many others, who had seen him there in the days of Pope Agatho,
          said that he was the same bishop that lately came to Rome, to be
          tried by the Apostolic see, being accused by his people, and
          <span class="tei tei-q">“who, said they, having long since come
          here upon the like accusation, the cause and contention of both
          parties being heard and examined, was proved by Pope Agatho, of
          blessed memory, to have been wrongfully expelled from his
          bishopric, and was held in such honour by him, that he commanded
          him to sit in the council of bishops which he had assembled, as a
          man of untainted faith and an upright mind.”</span> This being
          heard, the Pope and all the rest said, that a man of so great
          authority, who had held the office of a bishop for nearly forty
          years, ought by no means to be condemned, but being altogether
          cleared of the faults laid to his charge, should return home with
          honour.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When he came to
          Gaul, on his way back to Britain, on a sudden he fell sick, and the
          sickness increasing, he was so weighed down by it, that he could
          not ride, but was <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page355">[pg
          355]</span><a name="Pg355" id="Pg355" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          carried in his bed by the hands of his servants. Being thus come to
          the city of Maeldum,<a id="noteref_926" name="noteref_926" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_926"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">926</span></span></a> in
          Gaul, he lay four days and nights, as if he had been dead, and only
          by his faint breathing showed that he had any life in him. Having
          continued thus four days, without meat or drink, without speech or
          hearing, at length, on the fifth day, at daybreak, as it were
          awakening out of a deep sleep, he raised himself and sat up, and
          opening his eyes, saw round about him a company of brethren singing
          psalms and weeping. Sighing gently, he asked where Acca,<a id="noteref_927" name="noteref_927" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_927"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">927</span></span></a> the
          priest, was. This man, straightway being called, came in, and
          seeing him somewhat recovered and able to speak, knelt down, and
          gave thanks to God, with all the brethren there present. When they
          had sat awhile and begun to discourse, with great awe, of the
          judgements of heaven, the bishop bade the rest go out for a time,
          and spoke to the priest, Acca, after this manner:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“A dread vision has even now appeared to me, which I
          would have you hear and keep secret, till I know what God will
          please to do with me. There stood by me a certain one, glorious in
          white raiment, and he told me that he was Michael, the Archangel,
          and said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘I am sent to call you back from
          death: for the Lord has granted you life, through the prayers and
          tears of your disciples and brethren, and the intercession of His
          Blessed Mother Mary, of perpetual virginity; wherefore I tell you,
          that you shall now recover from this sickness; but be ready, for I
          will return and visit you at the end of four years. And when you
          come into your country, you shall recover the greater part of the
          possessions that have been taken from you, and shall end your days
          in peace and quiet.’</span> ”</span> The bishop accordingly
          recovered, whereat all men rejoiced and gave thanks to God, and
          setting forward on his journey, he arrived in Britain.</p>

          Wilfrid, in which request he prevailed; nevertheless Aldfrid, king

          by the ministry of the brethren, he was carried to his first

          buried in the church of the blessed Apostle Peter, hard by the
          altar on the south side, as has been mentioned above, and this
          epitaph was written over him:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Here rests the body of the great Bishop Wilfrid, who,
          for love of piety, built these courts and consecrated them with the
          noble name of Peter, to whom Christ, the Judge of all the earth,
          gave the keys of Heaven. And devoutly he clothed them with gold and
          Tyrian purple; yea, and he placed here the trophy of the Cross, of
          shining ore, uplifted high; moreover he caused the four
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page357">[pg 357]</span><a name="Pg357" id="Pg357" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> books of the Gospel
          to be written in gold in their order, and he gave a case meet for
          them of ruddy gold. And he also brought the holy season of Easter,
          returning in its course, to accord with the true teaching of the
          catholic rule which the Fathers fixed, and, banishing all doubt and
          error, gave his nation sure guidance in their worship. And in this
          place he gathered a great throng of monks, and with all diligence
          safeguarded the precepts which the Fathers' rule enjoined. And long
          time sore vexed by many a peril at home and abroad, when he had
          held the office of a bishop forty-five years, he passed away and
          with joy departed to the heavenly kingdom. Grant, O Jesus, that the
          flock may follow in the path of the shepherd.”</span></p>

          English, which was his native language.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Acca,<a id="noteref_942" name="noteref_942" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_942"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">942</span></span></a> his

          a man of zeal and great in noble works in the sight of God and man.
          He enriched the structure of his church, which is dedicated in
          honour of the blessed Apostle Andrew with manifold adornments and
          marvellous workmanship. For he gave all diligence, as he does to
          this day, to procure relics of the blessed Apostles and martyrs of
          Christ from all parts, and to raise altars in their honour in
          separate side-chapels built for the purpose within the walls of the
          same church. Besides which, he industriously gathered the histories
          of their martyrdom, together with other ecclesiastical writings,
          and erected there a large and noble library. He likewise carefully
          provided holy vessels, lamps, and other such things as appertain to
          the adorning of the house of God. He in like manner invited to him
          a notable singer called Maban,<a id="noteref_943" name="noteref_943" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_943"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">943</span></span></a> who
          had been taught to sing by the successors of the disciples of the
          blessed Pope Gregory in Kent, to instruct himself and his clergy,
          and kept him twelve years, to the end that he might teach such
          Church music as they did not know, and by his teaching restore to
          its former state that which was corrupted either by long use, or
          through neglect. For Bishop Acca himself was a most skilful singer,
          as well as most learned in Holy Writ, sound in the confession of
          the catholic faith, and well versed in the rules of ecclesiastical
          custom; nor does he cease to walk after this manner, till he
          receive the rewards of his pious devotion. For he was brought up
          from boyhood and instructed among the clergy of the most holy and
          beloved of God, Bosa, bishop of York.<a id="noteref_944" name="noteref_944" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_944"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">944</span></span></a>
          Afterwards, coming to Bishop Wilfrid in the hope of a better plan
          of life, he spent the rest of his days in attendance on him till
          that bishop's death, and going with him to Rome, learned there many
          profitable things concerning the ordinances of the Holy Church,
          which he could not have learned in his own country.</p>

          the Apostles. Moreover, he and all his people, he said, would
          always follow the custom of the holy Roman Apostolic Church, in so
          far as men so distant from the speech and nation of the Romans
          could learn it. The most reverend Abbot Ceolfrid favourably
          receiving his godly desires and requests, sent the builders he
          desired, and likewise the following letter:<a id="noteref_951" name="noteref_951" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_951"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">951</span></span></a></p>

          Naiton, Abbot Ceolfrid, greeting in the Lord.</span></span> We most
          readily and willingly endeavour, according to your desire, to make
          known to you the catholic observance of holy Easter, according to
          what we have learned of the Apostolic see, even as you, most devout
          king, in your godly zeal, have requested of us. For we know, that
          whensoever the lords of this world labour to learn, and to teach
          and to guard the truth, it is a gift of God to his Holy Church. For
          a certain profane writer<a id="noteref_952" name="noteref_952" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_952"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">952</span></span></a> has
          most truly said, that the world would be most happy if either kings
          were philosophers, or philosophers were kings. Now if a man of this
          world could judge truly of the philosophy of this world, and form a
          right choice concerning the state of this world, how much more is
          it to be desired, and most earnestly to be prayed for by such as
          are citizens of the heavenly country, and strangers and pilgrims in
          this world, that the more powerful any are in the world the more
          they may strive to hearken to the commands of Him who is the
          Supreme Judge, and by their example and authority may teach those
          that are committed to their charge, to keep the same, together with
          themselves.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“There are then three rules given in the Sacred
          Writings, whereby the time of keeping Easter has been appointed for
          us and may in no wise be changed by any authority of man; two
          whereof are divinely established <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page361">[pg 361]</span><a name="Pg361" id="Pg361" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> in the law of Moses; the third is added in
          the Gospel by reason of the Passion and Resurrection of our Lord.
          For the law enjoined, that the Passover should be kept in the first
          month of the year, and the third week of that month, that is, from
          the fifteenth day to the one-and-twentieth. It is added, by
          Apostolic institution, from the Gospel, that we are to wait for the
          Lord's day in that third week, and to keep the beginning of the
          Paschal season on the same. Which threefold rule whosoever shall
          rightly observe, will never err in fixing the Paschal feast. But if
          you desire to be more plainly and fully informed in all these
          particulars, it is written in Exodus, where the people of Israel,
          being about to be delivered out of Egypt, are commanded to keep the
          first Passover,<a id="noteref_953" name="noteref_953" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_953"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">953</span></span></a> that
          the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron, saying, <span class="tei tei-q">‘This month shall be unto you the beginning of months;
          it shall be the first month of the year to you. Speak ye unto all
          the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth day of this month
          they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to the house of
          their fathers, a lamb for an house.’</span> And a little
          after,<a id="noteref_954" name="noteref_954" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_954"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">954</span></span></a>
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘And ye shall keep it up until the
          fourteenth day of the same month; and the whole assembly of the
          congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening.’</span> By
          which words it most plainly appears, that in the Paschal
          observance, though mention is made of the fourteenth day, yet it is
          not commanded that the Passover be kept on that day; but on the
          evening of the fourteenth day, that is, when the fifteenth moon,
          which is the beginning of the third week, appears in the sky, it is
          commanded that the lamb be killed; and that it was the night of the
          fifteenth moon, when the Egyptians were smitten and Israel was
          redeemed from long captivity. He says,<a id="noteref_955" name="noteref_955" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_955"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">955</span></span></a>
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘Seven days shall ye eat unleavened
          bread.’</span> By which words all the third week of that same first
          month is appointed to be a solemn feast. But lest we should think
          that those same seven days were to be reckoned from the fourteenth
          to the twentieth, He forthwith <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page362">[pg 362]</span><a name="Pg362" id="Pg362" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> adds,<a id="noteref_956" name="noteref_956" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_956"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">956</span></span></a>
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘Even the first day ye shall put away
          leaven out of your houses; for whosoever eateth leavened bread,
          from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut
          off from Israel;’</span> and so on, till he says,<a id="noteref_957" name="noteref_957" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_957"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">957</span></span></a>
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘For in this selfsame day I will bring your
          army out of the land of Egypt.’</span></span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Thus he calls that the first day of unleavened bread,
          in which he was to bring their army out of Egypt. Now it is
          evident, that they were not brought out of Egypt on the fourteenth
          day, in the evening whereof the lamb was killed, and which is
          properly called the Passover or Phase, but on the fifteenth day, as
          is most plainly written in the book of Numbers:<a id="noteref_958" name="noteref_958" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_958"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">958</span></span></a>
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘and they departed from Rameses on the
          fifteenth day of the first month, on the morrow after the Passover
          the Israelites went out with an high hand.’</span> Thus the seven
          days of unleavened bread, on the first whereof the people of the
          Lord were brought out of Egypt, are to be reckoned from the
          beginning of the third week, as has been said, that is, from the
          fifteenth day of the first month, till the end of the
          one-and-twentieth of the same month. But the fourteenth day is
          named apart from this number, by the title of the Passover, as is
          plainly shown by that which follows in Exodus:<a id="noteref_959" name="noteref_959" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_959"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">959</span></span></a>
          where, after it is said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘For in this
          self-same day I will bring your army out of the land of
          Egypt;’</span> it is forthwith added, <span class="tei tei-q">‘And
          ye shall observe this day in your generations by an ordinance for
          ever. In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, ye
          shall eat unleavened bread, until the one-and-twentieth day of the
          month at even. Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your
          houses.’</span> Now, who is there that does not perceive, that
          there are not only seven days, but rather eight, from the
          fourteenth to the one-and-twentieth, if the fourteenth be also
          reckoned in the number? But if, as appears by diligent study of the
          truth of the Scriptures, we reckon from the evening of the
          fourteenth day to the evening of the one-and-twentieth, we shall
          certainly <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page363">[pg
          363]</span><a name="Pg363" id="Pg363" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          find, that, while the Paschal feast begins on the evening of the
          fourteenth day, yet the whole sacred solemnity contains no more
          than only seven nights and as many days. Wherefore the rule which
          we laid down is proved to be true, when we said that the Paschal
          season is to be celebrated in the first month of the year, and the
          third week of the same. For it is in truth the third week, because
          it begins on the evening of the fourteenth day, and ends on the
          evening of the one-and-twentieth.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“But since Christ our Passover is sacrificed,<a id="noteref_960" name="noteref_960" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_960"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">960</span></span></a> and
          has made the Lord's day, which among the ancients was called the
          first day of the week, a solemn day to us for the joy of His
          Resurrection, the Apostolic tradition has included it in the
          Paschal festival; yet has decreed that the time of the legal
          Passover be in no wise anticipated or diminished; but rather
          ordains, that according to the precept of the law, that same first
          month of the year, and the fourteenth day of the same, and the
          evening thereof be awaited. And when this day should chance to fall
          on a Saturday, every man should take to him a lamb, according to
          the house of his fathers, a lamb for an house, and he should kill
          it in the evening, that is, that all the Churches throughout the
          world, making one Catholic Church, should provide Bread and Wine
          for the Mystery of the Flesh and Blood of the spotless Lamb
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘that hath taken away the sins of the
          world;’</span><a id="noteref_961" name="noteref_961" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_961"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">961</span></span></a> and
          after a fitting solemn service of lessons and prayers and Paschal
          ceremonies, they should offer up these to the Lord, in hope of
          redemption to come. For this is that same night in which the people
          of Israel were delivered out of Egypt by the blood of the lamb;
          this is the same in which all the people of God were, by Christ's
          Resurrection, set free from eternal death. Then, in the morning,
          when the Lord's day dawns, they should celebrate the first day of
          the Paschal festival; for that is the day on which our Lord made
          known the glory of His Resurrection to His disciples, to their
          manifold joy at the merciful revelation. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page364">[pg 364]</span><a name="Pg364" id="Pg364" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> The same is the first day of unleavened
          bread, concerning which it is plainly written in Leviticus,<a id="noteref_962" name="noteref_962" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_962"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">962</span></span></a>
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘In the fourteenth day of the first month,
          at even, is the Lord's Passover. And on the fifteenth day of the
          same month is the feast of unleavened bread unto the Lord; seven
          days ye must eat unleavened bread. In the first day ye shall have
          an holy convocation.’</span></span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“If therefore it could be that the Lord's day should
          always happen on the fifteenth day of the first month, that is, on
          the fifteenth moon, we might always celebrate the Passover at one
          and the same time with the ancient people of God, though the nature
          of the mystery be different, as we do it with one and the same
          faith. But inasmuch as the day of the week does not keep pace
          exactly with the moon, the Apostolic tradition, which was preached
          at Rome by the blessed Peter, and confirmed at Alexandria by Mark
          the Evangelist,<a id="noteref_963" name="noteref_963" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_963"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">963</span></span></a> his
          interpreter, appointed that when the first month was come, and in
          it the evening of the fourteenth day, we should also wait for the
          Lord's day, between the fifteenth and the one-and-twentieth day of
          the same month. For on whichever of those days it shall fall,
          Easter will be rightly kept on the same; seeing that it is one of
          those seven days on which the feast of unleavened bread is
          commanded to be kept. Thus it comes to pass that our Easter never
          falls either before or after the third week of the first month, but
          has for its observance either the whole of it, to wit, the seven
          days of unleavened bread appointed by the law, or at least some of
          them. For though it comprises but one of them, that is, the
          seventh, which the Scripture so highly commends, saying,<a id="noteref_964" name="noteref_964" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_964"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">964</span></span></a>
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘But the seventh day shall be a more holy
          convocation, ye shall do no servile work therein,’</span> none can
          lay it to our charge, that we do not rightly keep Easter Sunday,
          which we received <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page365">[pg
          365]</span><a name="Pg365" id="Pg365" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          from the Gospel, in the third week of the first month, as the Law
          prescribes.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“The catholic reason of this observance being thus
          explained, the unreasonable error, on the other hand, of those who,
          without any necessity, presume either to anticipate, or to go
          beyond the term appointed in the Law, is manifest. For they that
          think Easter Sunday is to be observed from the fourteenth day of
          the first month till the twentieth moon, anticipate the time
          prescribed in the law, without any necessary reason; for when they
          begin to celebrate the vigil of the holy night from the evening of
          the thirteenth day, it is plain that they make that day the
          beginning of their Easter, whereof they find no mention in the
          commandment of the Law; and when they avoid celebrating our Lord's
          Easter on the one-and-twentieth day of the month, it is surely
          manifest that they wholly exclude that day from their solemnity,
          which the Law many times commends to be observed as a greater
          festival than the rest; and thus, perverting the proper order, they
          sometimes keep Easter Day entirely in the second week, and never
          place it on the seventh day of the third week. And again, they who
          think that Easter is to be kept from the sixteenth day of the said
          month till the two-and-twentieth<a id="noteref_965" name="noteref_965" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_965"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">965</span></span></a> no
          less erroneously, though on the other side, deviate from the right
          way of truth, and as it were avoiding shipwreck on Scylla, they
          fall into the whirlpool of Charybdis to be drowned. For when they
          teach that Easter is to be begun at the rising of the sixteenth
          moon of the first month, that is, from the evening of the fifteenth
          day, it is certain that they altogether exclude from their
          solemnity the fourteenth day of the same month, which the Law first
          and chiefly commends; so that they scarce touch the evening of the
          fifteenth day, on which the people of God were redeemed from
          Egyptian bondage, and on which our Lord, by His Blood, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page366">[pg 366]</span><a name="Pg366" id="Pg366" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> rescued the world from the darkness of
          sin, and on which being also buried, He gave us the hope of a
          blessed rest after death.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“And these men, receiving in themselves the recompense
          of their error, when they place Easter Sunday on the twenty-second
          day of the month, openly transgress and do violence to the term of
          Easter appointed by the Law, seeing that they begin Easter on the
          evening of that day in which the Law commanded it to be completed
          and brought to an end; and appoint that to be the first day of
          Easter, whereof no mention is any where found in the Law, to wit,
          the first of the fourth week. And both sorts are mistaken, not only
          in fixing and computing the moon's age, but also sometimes in
          finding the first month; but this controversy is longer than can be
          or ought to be contained in this letter. I will only say thus much,
          that by the vernal equinox, it may always be found, without the
          chance of an error, which must be the first month of the year,
          according to the lunar computation, and which the last. But the
          equinox, according to the opinion of all the Eastern nations, and
          particularly of the Egyptians,<a id="noteref_966" name="noteref_966" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_966"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">966</span></span></a> who
          surpass all other learned men in calculation, falls on the
          twenty-first day of March, as we also prove by horological
          observation. Whatsoever moon therefore is at the full before the
          equinox, being on the fourteenth or fifteenth day, the same belongs
          to the last month of the foregoing year, and consequently is not
          meet for the celebration of Easter; but that moon which is full
          after the equinox, or at the very time of the equinox, belongs to
          the first month, and on that day, without a doubt, we must
          understand that the ancients were wont to celebrate the Passover;
          and that we also ought to keep Easter when the Sunday comes. And
          that this must be so, there is this cogent reason. It is written in
          Genesis,<a id="noteref_967" name="noteref_967" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_967"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">967</span></span></a>
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘And God made two great lights; the greater
          light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the
          night.’</span> Or, as another edition<a id="noteref_968" name="noteref_968" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_968"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">968</span></span></a> has

          begin the night.’</span> As, therefore, the sun, coming forth from
          the midst of the east, fixed the vernal equinox by his rising, and
          afterwards the moon at the full, when the sun set in the evening,
          followed from the midst of the east; so every year the same first
          lunar month must be observed in the like order, so that its full
          moon must not be before the equinox; but either on the very day of
          the equinox, as it was in the beginning, or after it is past. But
          if the full moon shall happen to be but one day before the time of
          the equinox, the aforesaid reason proves that such moon is not to
          be assigned to the first month of the new year, but rather to the
          last of the preceding, and that it is therefore not meet for the
          celebration of the Paschal festival.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Now if it please you likewise to hear the mystical
          reason in this matter, we are commanded to keep Easter in the first
          month of the year, which is also called the month of new things,
          because we ought to celebrate the mysteries of our Lord's
          Resurrection and our deliverance, with the spirit of our minds
          renewed to the love of heavenly things. We are commanded to keep it
          in the third week of the same month, because Christ Himself, who
          had been promised before the Law, and under the Law, came with
          grace, in the third age of the world, to be sacrificed as our
          Passover; and because rising from the dead the third day after the
          offering of His Passion, He wished this to be called the Lord's
          day, and the Paschal feast of His Resurrection to be yearly
          celebrated on the same; because, also, we do then only truly
          celebrate His solemn festival, if we endeavour with Him to keep the
          Passover, that is, the passing from this world to the Father, by
          faith, hope, and charity. We are commanded to observe the full moon
          of the Paschal month after the vernal equinox, to the end, that the
          sun may first make the day longer than the night, and then the moon
          may show to the world her full orb of light; inasmuch as first
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘the Sun of righteousness, with healing in
          His wings,’</span><a id="noteref_969" name="noteref_969" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_969"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">969</span></span></a> that
          is, our Lord Jesus, by the triumph of His Resurrection,
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page368">[pg 368]</span><a name="Pg368" id="Pg368" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> dispelled all the
          darkness of death, and so ascending into Heaven, filled His Church,
          which is often signified by the name of the moon, with the light of
          inward grace, by sending down upon her His Spirit. Which order of
          our salvation the prophet had in his mind, when he said
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘The sun was exalted and the moon stood in
          her order.’</span></span><a id="noteref_970" name="noteref_970" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_970"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">970</span></span></a></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“He, therefore, who shall contend that the full Paschal
          moon can happen before the equinox, disagrees with the doctrine of
          the Holy Scriptures, in the celebration of the greatest mysteries,
          and agrees with those who trust that they may be saved without the
          grace of Christ preventing them,<a id="noteref_971" name="noteref_971" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_971"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">971</span></span></a> and
          who presume to teach that they might have attained to perfect
          righteousness, though the true Light had never by death and
          resurrection vanquished the darkness of the world. Thus, after the
          rising of the sun at the equinox, and after the full moon of the
          first month following in her order, that is, after the end of the
          fourteenth day of the same month, all which we have received by the
          Law to be observed, we still, as we are taught in the Gospel, wait
          in the third week for the Lord's day; and so, at length, we
          celebrate the offering of our Easter solemnity, to show that we are
          not, with the ancients, doing honour to the casting off of the yoke
          of Egyptian bondage; but that, with devout faith and love, we
          worship the Redemption of the whole world, which having been
          prefigured in the deliverance of the ancient people of God, was
          fulfilled in Christ's Resurrection, and that we may signify that we
          rejoice in the sure and certain hope of our own resurrection, which
          we believe will likewise happen on the Lord's day.</span></p>

          which began long since to be observed in the Church, to wit, even

          was reduced to a plainer system; insomuch that what till then used

          of Alexandria, might, from that time forward, be most easily known
          by all men, the occurrence of the fourteenth moon being regularly

          his successor, comprised a series of ninety-five years in five
          cycles of nineteen years. After whom, Dionysius Exiguus<a id="noteref_977" name="noteref_977" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_977"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">977</span></span></a> added
          as many more, in order, after the same manner, reaching down to our
          own time. The expiration of these is now drawing near, but there is
          at the present day so great a number of calculators, that even in
          our Churches throughout Britain, there are many who, having learned
          the ancient rules of the Egyptians, can with great ease carry on
          the Paschal cycles for any length of time, even to five hundred and
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page370">[pg 370]</span><a name="Pg370" id="Pg370" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> thirty-two
          years,<a id="noteref_978" name="noteref_978" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_978"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">978</span></span></a> if
          they will; after the expiration of which, all that appertains to
          the succession of sun and moon, month and week, returns in the same
          order as before. We therefore forbear to send you these same cycles
          of the times to come, because, desiring only to be instructed
          respecting the reason for the Paschal time, you show that you have
          enough of those catholic cycles concerning Easter.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“But having said thus much briefly and succinctly, as
          you required, concerning Easter, I also exhort you to take heed
          that the tonsure, concerning which likewise you desired me to write
          to you, be in accordance with the use of the Church and the
          Christian Faith. And we know indeed that the Apostles were not all
          shorn after the same manner, nor does the Catholic Church now, as
          it agrees in one faith, hope, and charity towards God, use one and
          the same form of tonsure throughout the world. Moreover, to look
          back to former times, to wit, the times of the patriarchs, Job, the
          pattern of patience, when tribulation came upon him, shaved his
          head,<a id="noteref_979" name="noteref_979" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_979"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">979</span></span></a> and
          thus made it appear that he had used, in time of prosperity, to let
          his hair grow. But concerning Joseph, who more than other men
          practised and taught chastity, humility, piety, and the other
          virtues, we read that he was shorn when he was to be delivered from
          bondage,<a id="noteref_980" name="noteref_980" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_980"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">980</span></span></a> by
          which it appears, that during the time of his bondage, he was in
          the prison with unshorn hair. Behold then how each of these men of
          God differed in the manner of their appearance abroad, though their
          inward consciences agreed in a like grace of virtue. But though we
          may be free to confess, that the difference of tonsure is not
          hurtful to those whose faith is pure towards God, and their charity
          sincere towards their neighbour, especially since we do not read
          that there was ever any controversy among the Catholic fathers
          about the difference of tonsure, as there has been a contention
          about the diversity in keeping Easter, and in matters of faith;
          nevertheless, among all the forms of tonsure that are to be found
          in <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page371">[pg 371]</span><a name="Pg371" id="Pg371" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the Church, or among
          mankind at large, I think none more meet to be followed and
          received by us than that which that disciple wore on his head, to
          whom, after his confession of Himself, our Lord said,<a id="noteref_981" name="noteref_981" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_981"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">981</span></span></a>
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will
          build My Church, and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against
          it, and I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of
          Heaven.’</span> Nor do I think that any is more rightly to be
          abhorred and detested by all the faithful, than that which that man
          used, to whom that same Peter, when he would have bought the grace
          of the Holy Ghost, said,<a id="noteref_982" name="noteref_982" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_982"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">982</span></span></a>
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘Thy money perish with thee, because thou
          hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money. Thou
          hast neither part nor lot in this word.’</span> Nor do we shave
          ourselves in the form of a crown only because Peter was so shorn;
          but because Peter was so shorn in memory of the Passion of our
          Lord, therefore we also, who desire to be saved by the same
          Passion, do with him bear the sign of the same Passion on the top
          of our head, which is the highest part of our body. For as all the
          Church, because it was made a Church by the death of Him that gave
          it life, is wont to bear the sign of His Holy Cross on the
          forehead, to the end, that it may, by the constant protection of
          His banner, be defended from the assaults of evil spirits, and by
          the frequent admonition of the same be taught, in like manner, to
          crucify the flesh with its affections and lusts;<a id="noteref_983" name="noteref_983" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_983"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">983</span></span></a> so
          also it behoves those, who having either taken the vows of a monk,
          or having the degree of a clerk, must needs curb themselves the
          more strictly by continence, for the Lord's sake, to bear each one
          of them on his head, by the tonsure, the form of the crown of
          thorns which He bore on His head in His Passion, that He might bear
          the thorns and thistles of our sins, that is, that he might bear
          them away and take them from us; to the end that they may show on
          their foreheads that they also willingly, and readily, endure all
          scoffing and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page372">[pg
          372]</span><a name="Pg372" id="Pg372" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          reproach for his sake; and that they may signify that they await
          always <span class="tei tei-q">‘the crown of eternal life, which
          God hath promised to them that love him,’</span><a id="noteref_984" name="noteref_984" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_984"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">984</span></span></a> and
          that for the sake of attaining thereto they despise both the evil
          and the good of this world. But as for the tonsure which Simon
          Magus is said to have used, who is there of the faithful, I ask
          you, who does not straightway detest and reject it at the first
          sight of it, together with his magic? Above the forehead it does
          seem indeed to resemble a crown; but when you come to look at the
          neck, you will find the crown cut short which you thought you saw;
          so that you may perceive that such a use properly belongs not to
          Christians but to Simoniacs, such as were indeed in this life by
          erring men thought worthy of the glory of an everlasting crown; but
          in that which is to follow this life are not only deprived of all
          hope of a crown, but are moreover condemned to eternal
          punishment.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“But do not think that I have said thus much, as though
          I judged them worthy to be condemned who use this tonsure, if they
          uphold the catholic unity by their faith and works; nay, I
          confidently declare, that many of them have been holy men and
          worthy servants of God. Of which number is Adamnan,<a id="noteref_985" name="noteref_985" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_985"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">985</span></span></a> the
          notable abbot and priest of the followers of Columba, who, when
          sent on a mission by his nation to King Aldfrid, desired to see our
          monastery, and forasmuch as he showed wonderful wisdom, humility,
          and piety in his words and behaviour, I said to him among other
          things, when I talked with him, <span class="tei tei-q">‘I beseech
          you, holy brother, how is it that you, who believe that you are
          advancing to the crown of life, which knows no end, wear on your
          head, after a fashion ill-suited to your belief, the likeness of a
          crown that has an end? And if you seek the fellowship of the
          blessed Peter, why do you imitate the likeness of the tonsure of
          him whom St. Peter anathematized? and why do you not rather even
          now show that you choose with <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page373">[pg 373]</span><a name="Pg373" id="Pg373" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> all your heart the fashion of him with whom
          you desire to live in bliss for ever.’</span> He answered,
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘Be assured, my dear brother, that though I
          wear the tonsure of Simon, according to the custom of my country,
          yet I detest and abhor with all my soul the heresy of Simon; and I
          desire, as far as lies in my small power, to follow the footsteps
          of the most blessed chief of the Apostles.’</span> I replied,
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘I verily believe it; nevertheless it is a
          token that you embrace in your inmost heart whatever is of Peter
          the Apostle, if you also observe in outward form that which you
          know to be his. For I think your wisdom easily discerns that it is
          much better to estrange from your countenance, already dedicated to
          God, the fashion of his countenance whom with all your heart you
          abhor, and of whose hideous face you would shun the sight; and, on
          the other hand, that it beseems you to imitate the manner of his
          appearance, whom you seek to have for your advocate before God,
          even as you desire to follow his actions and his
          teaching.’</span></span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“This I said at that time to Adamnan, who indeed showed
          how much he had profited by seeing the ordinances of our Churches,

          afterwards by his preaching led great numbers of that nation to the
          catholic observance of the Paschal time; though he was not yet able
          to bring back to the way of the better ordinance the monks that
          lived in the island of Hii over whom he presided with the special
          authority of a superior. He would also have been mindful to amend
          the tonsure, if his influence had availed so far.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“But I now also admonish your wisdom, O king, that

          men, and carefully interpreted into his own language by those who
          could understand it, he is said to have much rejoiced at the
          exhortation thereof; insomuch that, rising from among his nobles
          that sat about him, he knelt on the ground, giving thanks to God
          that he had been found worthy to receive such a gift from the land
          of the English. <span class="tei tei-q">“And indeed,”</span> he
          said, <span class="tei tei-q">“I knew before, that this was the
          true celebration of Easter, but now I so fully learn the reason for
          observing this time, that I seem in all points to have known but
          little before concerning these matters. Therefore I publicly
          declare and protest to you that are here present, that I will for
          ever observe this time of Easter, together with all my nation; and
          I do decree that this tonsure, which we have heard to be
          reasonable, shall be received by all clerks in my kingdom.”</span>
          Without delay he accomplished by his royal authority what he had
          said. For straightway the Paschal cycles of nineteen years were
          sent by command of the State throughout all the provinces of the
          Picts to be transcribed, learned, and observed, the erroneous
          cycles of eighty-four years being everywhere blotted out.<a id="noteref_987" name="noteref_987" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_987"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">987</span></span></a> All
          the ministers of the altar and monks were shorn after the fashion
          of the crown; and the nation thus reformed, rejoiced, as being
          newly put under the guidance of Peter, the most blessed chief of
          the Apostles, and committed to his protection.</p>

          Egbert, beloved of God, and worthy to be named with all honour,
          whom we have before often mentioned, came to them from Ireland, and
          was honourably and joyfully received. Being a most gracious
          teacher, and most devout in practising those things which he
          taught, and being willingly heard by all, by his pious and diligent
          exhortations, he converted them from that deep-rooted tradition of
          their fathers, of whom may be said those words of the Apostle,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“That they had a zeal of God, but not
          according to knowledge.”</span><a id="noteref_991" name="noteref_991" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_991"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">991</span></span></a> He
          taught them to celebrate the principal solemnity after the catholic
          and apostolic manner, as has been said, wearing on their heads the
          figure of an unending crown.<a id="noteref_992" name="noteref_992" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_992"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">992</span></span></a> It is
          manifest that this came to pass by a wonderful dispensation of the
          Divine goodness; to the end, that the same nation which had
          willingly, and without grudging, taken heed to impart to the
          English people that learning which it had in the knowledge of God,
          should afterwards, by means of the English nation, be brought, in
          those things which it had not, to a perfect rule of life. Even as,
          contrarywise, the Britons, who <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page376">[pg 376]</span><a name="Pg376" id="Pg376" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> would not reveal to the English the knowledge
          which they had of the Christian faith, now, when the English people
          believe, and are in all points instructed in the rule of the
          Catholic faith, still persist in their errors, halting and turned
          aside from the true path, expose their heads without a crown, and
          keep the Feast of Christ apart from the fellowship of the Church of
          Christ.<a id="noteref_993" name="noteref_993" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_993"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">993</span></span></a></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The monks of
          Hii, at the teaching of Egbert, adopted the catholic manner of
          conversation, under Abbot Dunchad, about eighty years after they
          had sent Bishop Aidan to preach to the English nation.<a id="noteref_994" name="noteref_994" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_994"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">994</span></span></a> The
          man of God, Egbert, remained thirteen years in the aforesaid
          island, which he had thus consecrated to Christ, as it were, by a
          new ray of the grace of fellowship and peace in the Church; and in
          the year of our Lord 729, in which Easter was celebrated on the
          24th of April, when he had celebrated the solemnity of the Mass, in
          memory of the Resurrection of our Lord, that same day he departed
          to the Lord and thus finished, or rather never ceases endlessly to
          celebrate, with our Lord, and the Apostles, and the other citizens
          of heaven, the joy of that greatest festival, which he had begun
          with the brethren, whom he had converted to the grace of unity. And
          it was a wonderful dispensation of the Divine Providence, that the
          venerable man passed from this world to the Father, not only at
          Easter, but also when Easter was celebrated on that day,<a id="noteref_995" name="noteref_995" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#note_995"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">995</span></span></a> on
          which it had never been wont to be celebrated in those parts. The
          brethren rejoiced in the sure and catholic knowledge of the time of
          Easter, and were glad in that their father, by whom they had been
          brought into the right way, passing hence to the Lord should plead
          for them. He also gave thanks that he had so long continued in the
          flesh, till he saw his hearers accept and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page377">[pg 377]</span><a name="Pg377" id="Pg377" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> keep with him as Easter that day which they
          had ever before avoided. Thus the most reverend father being
          assured of their amendment, rejoiced to see the day of the Lord,
          and he saw it and was glad.</p>

          our Lord 729, two comets appeared about the sun, to the great
          terror of the beholders. One of them went before the sun in the
          morning at his rising, the other followed him when he set in the
          evening, as it were presaging dire disaster to both east and west;
          or without doubt one was the forerunner of the day, and the other
          of the night, to signify that mortals were threatened with
          calamities at both times. They carried their flaming brands towards
          the north, as it were ready to kindle a conflagration. They
          appeared in January, and continued nearly a fortnight. At which
          time a grievous blight fell upon Gaul, in that it was laid waste by
          the Saracens with cruel bloodshed; but not long after in that

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A full
            discussion of this involved question is beyond our scope. Readers
            are referred to Plummer (Excursus on Paschal Controversy),
            Bright, or Hunt. Here, the point at issue may be briefly stated.
            It was regarded as essential by the Roman Church that Easter Day
            should be kept on a Sunday, in the third week of the first month,
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the month in which the
            full moon occurred on or after the vernal equinox. The Celts
            observed the Feast on Sunday, and were, therefore, not rightly
            called <span class="tei tei-q">“Quartodecimans”</span> (the name
            given to those who observed it on the 14th of the month Nisan,
            the day of the Jewish Passover, without regard to the day of the
            week). They differed from the Romans in fixing the vernal equinox
            at March 25th, instead of March 21st, and in their reckoning of
            the third week, holding it to be from the 14th to the 20th of the
            moon inclusive. The Roman Church originally reckoned it from the
            16th to the 22nd, but ultimately fixed it from the 15th to the
            21st (cf. V, 21, p. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#Pg365" class="tei tei-ref">365</a>).</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There was a
            further divergence in the <span class="tei tei-q">“cycles”</span>
            adopted to ascertain the day in each year on which the Paschal
            moon would fall. The Celts retained an old cycle of eighty-four
            years, while the Romans had finally adopted one of nineteen. It
            is obvious that these differences must necessarily lead to great
            divergence in practice and consequently serious inconvenience.
            The real importance of this and the other points of difference,
            settled afterwards at the Synod of Whitby, lay in the question
            whether England was to conform to the practice of the Catholic
            Church, or to isolate herself from it by local peculiarities (cf.
            the reply of the British to Augustine: <span class="tei tei-q">“They would do none of those things nor receive him
            as their archbishop”</span>).</p>

          method was the Oriental, which consisted in shaving the whole head
          (cf. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#Book_IV_Chap_I" class="tei tei-ref">IV, 1</a>).</dd>

          omission of chrism, an omission which was affirmed of the Irish at

          conjecture rests on a canon respecting Baptism established in the

          under the influence of St. Martin of Tours, to whom he afterwards
          dedicated his church in Galloway, and returned as a missionary to

          south of the Grampians. Irish tradition, difficult to reconcile

          spent the last years of his life in Ireland and founded a church at
          Leinster. He was commemorated there on September 16th, under the

          tells us that Theodore divided the great Mercian bishopric, but it
          appears soon after as a separate see for Hecana (Herefordshire).
          Possibly Putta, who is traditionally reckoned as its first bishop,

          persecution, according to her <span class="tei tei-q">“Acta”</span>
          (the Diocletian, according to the Martyrology and Aldhelm). Eulalia
          was burnt to death at the age of twelve in the Diocletian
          persecution, having denounced herself. The legend tells that a
          white dove hovered over her ashes till snow fell and covered them.
          Tecla, the disciple of St. Paul, is said to have been the first
          virgin martyr. She was miraculously saved from her martyrdom and
          died in peace long after. Euphemia was torn by wild beasts at
          Chalcedon in 307 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> in the Diocletian
          persecution. Asterius, Bishop of Amasea, 400 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>, says that he saw a
          tablet in the church at Chalcedon depicting her sufferings. We have

          places her martyrdom as late as the time of Diocletian. Her
          connection with music does not appear in the legends, and is
          probably due to the fact that Pope Paschal endowed the monastery
          which he built in connection with her church at Rome to provide for
          musical services at her tomb day and night.</dd>

          <dd class="tei tei-notetext">His name does not appear in any of the
          lists of bishops. There is no evidence that a see of Dorchester
          (cf. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#Book_III_Chap_VII" class="tei tei-ref">III, 7</a>,
          and note) existed at this time, except from this passage and the
          statement of Florence of Worcester to the effect that a fivefold
          division of the Mercian diocese took place in 679, that Dorchester
          was included in Mercia, and that Aetla was appointed as its bishop.
          Probably this latter statement is derived from Bede. It has been
          proposed to identify Aetla with Haedde, Bishop of the West Saxons
          (<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#Book_III_Chap_VII" class="tei tei-ref">III, 7</a>;

          seems unlikely that Bede should not have mentioned their identity.
          The most probable explanation seems to be that a see was
          established about 679 at Dorchester (which may have been under
          Mercia at the time) and that Aetla was its bishop, but that it had
          only a very short existence.</dd>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Project
              Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread
              public support and donations to carry out its mission of
              increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that
              can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible
              by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment.
              Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important
              to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
              Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
              charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the
              United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it
              takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to
              meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit
              donations in locations where we have not received written
              confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the
              status of compliance for any particular state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate" class="tei tei-xref">http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate</a></p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While we
              cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
              have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no
              prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors
              in such states who approach us with offers to donate.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
              International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot
              make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations
              received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp
              our small staff.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Please check
              the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods

              thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg™
              eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</p>

              Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
              editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the
              U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
              necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Each eBook
              is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's eBook
