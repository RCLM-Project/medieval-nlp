PREFACE.



THE only printed version of this valuable Chronicle is that
contained in the " Scrip tores postBedam" of Sir Henry Saville,
London, 1596, and reprinted at Frankfort in 1601. The
typographical errors and omissions in both these editions are
almost innumerable ; so much so, that of necessity the more
onerous duties of an Editor* devolve in a considerable degree
upon the Translator of any of the authors contained in the
volume.

In the present Translation the text has been carefully exa-
mined throughout, and the greater portion, it is believed, of
the errors corrected ; in many instances on the safest of all
grounds reference to the works of contemporary writers. At-
tention is called in the Notes to the more important of these

* * This was sensibly felt to be the case by Mr. Sharpe, in his translation
of William of Malmesbury. Archbishop Nicolson says, in his " English
Historical Library," p. 59, " Hoveden's History was published by Sir
H. Saville ; but (as Sir H. Spelman observes in his Glossary, on the word
Frithborgd) there are many errors in that foreign Edition of this, and all
our other Historians, and, therefore, he well cautions the English reader
attentively to consider the spelling of such words as are of our own growth,
as very frequently mistaken by printers, that are strangers to our country
and language." It is but just to remark that, in the present instance, the
errors in the English edition are almost as numerous as in the foreign one.



IV PREFACE.

corrections, in cases where they are a matter of question.
It has been thought advisable to retain the ancient names of
places where they differ materially from those of the present
day, and to add the latter in the Notes.

Of the author of this work but little is known. He is some-
times spoken of as a native of York, but it is more probable
that he was born at Hoveden, now Howden, a vill in the
East Riding of Yorkshire, which belonged to the bishops of
Durham, and where they occasionally resided. Frequent
mention is made of this place in the Annals, in connection
with those powerful prelates.* It has been suggested by some
writers that our author is the person mentioned by Robert of
Gloucester as "Hew of Howdene."f Among the various
offices held by him, he is said to have been a professor of
Theology at Oxford, and to have been employed, perhaps
at a later period of his life, by Henry II., in the capacity
of chaplain. Like many of the more learned clergy of his
day, uniting the study of the LawJ with that of Divinity,

* For the first time, at p. 389 of this Volume. We learn from our author
that Hugh de Pusaz, or Pudsey, bishop of Durham, died at Howden.

t Mr. Hardy says, in the Introduction to the " Monumenta Britan-
nica," p. viii., " The Burton Annals (Gale I.) mention a Hugh Hoveden,
as does Robert of Gloucester, but Roger is certainly the person intended.
The mistake arose probably from the practice of indicating an author's
name by the initial letters only, and the scribe hastily inserted H instead
of R." The lines of Robert of Gloucester alluded to are the following, (he
is speaking of Richard I.) :

" But who so wole of his chevalrie, know or wyte,
Rede he in the cornycles that ben of him wryte,
That Mayster Hew hath of Howdene ywrouzte.''

If in these lines he refers to our Chronicler, it is pretty clear that he is the
same person who wrote the life of Richard I., mentioned by Bishop Tanner
as .-aid to be among the Digby MSS. in the Bodleian Library.

This will probably account for the vast amount of information on
legal matters which is to be found in the latter part of the work. Tanner
seems to think that Hoveden devoted himself to the law when in mid-



PREFACE. V

he acted as one of the clerks* or secretaries of that king ; and,
probably in such capacity, was employed in visiting monas-
teries on the death of the abbats or priors, for the purpose of
receiving such portions of the revenues thereof as accrued to
the crown. This fact will account for the great number of
letters, charters, papal rescripts, bulls, and other matters relative
to the Ecclesiastical history of his time, which are to be found in
his work ; while his connection, through the place of his birth,
with the sees of York and Durham, will explain why the
affairs of those sees are so abundantly treated of.

Hoveden has been charged by Leland with surreptitiously bor-
rowing from Simeon of Durham, the great Chronicler of North-
umbria ; but it is not improbable that he enjoyed opportunities
of free access to the materials from which Simeon compiled
his Chronicles, and, as Archbishop Nicolson remarks, f if he did
copy anything from him, he has greatly improved his narra-
tive by carefully identifying the chronology of many matters
confusedly related by that author. That in some instances he
has closely followed Simeon of Durham and other preceding
Chroniclers, cannot, however, be questioned ; but the evident
universality of the practice among the Annalists of his times,
shews that the censure of Leland is misplaced, and that Ho-
veden was actuated by no sordid motive, or wish to assume the
credit of the labours of his predecessors.

The exact periods of his birth and death are unknown ; but
Tanner, following Leland, thinks that he did not commence

life, and subsequently entered the Church. He informs us that Walter
of Coventry states in his Annals that Hoveden was in the number of the
domestics of Henry II. ; that he was sent to Norwich by that king, on a
visit to the abbey there, for the purpose of auditing the expenditure of
the monks, and of superintending the election of a new abbat ; and that
his duties of a similar nature extended to other places.

PREFACE.

writing his Annals till after the death of Henry II., in 1189 ;
when probably he devoted himself entirely to literary pur-
suits.* It is not improbable that he survived till the time of
Henry III.

That he was a man of considerable learning, and, for his
time, of extensive knowledge, is evident from his work.
We find him frequently, and in some casesf appositely, quot-
ing Virgil, Ovid (who seems to have been his favourite
author), Lucan, and other Latin poets; but it is a curious
fact, that he on no occasion mentions the name of the
author from whom he quotes, or, indeed, of any Classical
writer whatever. Like most of the learned Ecclesiastics of
his day, he appears to have found peculiar charms in the jingle
of the Leonine or Latin rhyme ; a taste which had been re-
cently introduced into this country by its Norman conquerors.
His work also bears abundant proof that he was versed in
the legal and theological lore of those times.

On the other hand, it is clear, from his easy credulity, that
his mind was not at all in advance of his age. Miracles (some
of them of a very trifling and silly nature), portents, omens, pro-
phecies, and astrological predictions, are readily, and as a mat-
ter of course, copied into his pages ; while visits of the Devil in
person would almost appear to be considered by him as every-
day occurrences. Jews, Saracens, heretics, and Pagans are
summarily dealt with in his pages; and amid the pious
ejaculations which on some few occasions he utters when de-
picting the miseries or frailties of mankind, we find not a
word of sympathy wasted on their sufferings.

The Annals of Hoveden are not merely a Chronicle of En-

* We may here remark, that the passage in p. 247 of this Volume, in
which he appears to assert that he was eye-witness to an event that hap-
pened in 1144, is copied almost literally from Henry of Huntingdon, who
was probably the alleged witness of the miracle.

glish affairs, but (in the latter part especially) form a history of
the events of the then known world. Scotland, France, Ger-
many, Norway, Denmark, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Constan-
tinople, Asia Minor, and the Holy Land, all come under his
notice, and he sometimes treats of their affairs at consider-
able length. On two occasions* he gives an episodical account
of the then existing state of Geographical knowledge respect-
ing the West and the South of Europe, which, in spite of the
lamentably defective state of -the text, cannot fail to be read
with interest.

The work is divided into two Parts ; the First of which, pro-
fessing to be a continuation of Bede's Ecclesiastical History,
commences in 732 and concludes in 1 1 54. The Second Part com-
mences in 1155, and breaks off" in 1201, the third year of the
reign of king John. Why this division was made, it is impossi-
ble with certainty to say ; but it will readily be perceptible to
the reader that events are treated in the First Part with much
greater conciseness than in the second. This circumstance
would perhaps warrant the conclusion that he marked the be-
ginning of the reign of Henry II., in 1155, as the commence-
ment of a period the events of which had passed under his own
personal notice. In the concluding portion of the work, from
the year 1192, his circumstantiality is such that we might
almost imagine ourselves reading a newspaper account of events
which happened nearly seven hundred years ago.f
By some writers, among whom Bishop Tanner may be men-
tioned, his style has been considered defective, but it is never-
theless remarkable for its simplicity and freedom from affec-
tation. From his peculiar position there is no doubt that

t As a proof of this, we may remark, that while the events of the
period from 1155 to 1201 are compressed by Roger of Wendover and Mat-
thew Paris into less than 250, the narrative of Hoveden, relative to the
same period, extends to more than 800, pages.

he was able, and from the internal evidence offered by his
work, he clearly was desirous, to resort to the most authentic
sources of information within his reach ; consequently, though
his method of compilation is occasionally crude and defective
in arrangement, much is to be found, especially in the latter
portion of his work, which may be safely depended upon, and
which is to be met with in no other of the Chronicles of those
times. This high estimate of his authority appears to have
been formed at an early period ; for we learn from Archbishop
Nicolson,* on the authority of Pitts, that in the year 1291,
Edward I. caused diligent search to be made in all the libraries
of England for copies of his Annals, for the purpose, on their
evidence, of adjusting the disputes as to the homage due to
him from the crown of Scotland. In later times, Sir Henry
Saville, Selden, Archbishop Nlcolson, and others of the learned,
have concurred in bearing testimony to his diligence and
fidelity as a historian, and, according to Leland, notwithstand-
ing the censure in another place so undeservedly pronounced
upon him, he is superior to all the chroniclers who preceded
him.

His Annals are his only work the genuineness of which is
undisputed. Vossius, however, asserts that he was the author
of a History of the Kings of Northumbria, and a Life of
Thomas k Becket. In his Annals, he enters fully into the
disputes between king Henry and k Becket, and appears,
though in a very guarded manner, to sympathize with the
sufferings of that prelate, while at the same time he seems
desirous to exculpate his royal master from the crime of having
been accessary to his base assassination.

The remarks which he makes upon the characters of the
illustrious personages of his times are few and cautious;
still, the prominence which he gives to certain circumstances

and characteristics disclose the bias of his thoughts. It is
evident that he considered Henry II. a great king, and he
manifests a probably sincere sympathy for him in the nume-
rous afflictions, caused to him by the unprincipled conduct of
his sons, Henry, Richard, and Geoffrey. After the accession
of Richard, Hoveden seems to hint that boundless sensu-
ality was his great failing, and, though in words he does
not say so, he affords sufficient grounds for the conclusion
that treachery, meanness, and. avarice, were in his opinion
the striking features of the character of king John. His his-
tory does not come down to the time of the death, or " dis-
appearance," as Roger of "Wendover thinks proper to call it,
of Arthur, duke of Brittany. He evidently dislikes the crafty
and unprincipled Philip Augustus, king of France ; and the
zest with which he relates, on numerous occasions, how that
monarch turned his back in flight before the prowess of Richard
is highly amusing.

We may remark, in conclusion, that among the most in-
teresting portions of the work, may be reckoned the follow-
ing; the account of the contests between king Henry and
Thomas & Becket ; the first persecution of the Albigenses ; the
Assizes of Clarendon and Northampton ; the Laws* of William
the Conqueror, as re-enacted by Henry II. ; the Coronation of
Richard I. ; the Journal of that king's voyage to the Holy Land,
and of his adventures during his stay in Sicily ; the contest
between Hugh, bishop of Coventry, supported by the other
prelates, and the chancellor, William, bishop of Ely ; and the
lengthened disputes between Geoffrey, archbishop of York, and
his dean and chapter ; which latter are not yet brought to a
conclusion, when the work somewhat abruptly ends.

* Here the text is in such a corrupt and mutilated state that it entirely
defies successful management. The Translation has therefore been made
from the more correct text of the same Laws, which is found in the " Leges
Anglo-Saxonicae" of Dr.Wilkins. London, 1721.

The following remarks, relative to this Chronicler, are ex-
tracted from the Introduction to the " Monumenta Britannica,"
commenced by the late Mr. Petrie, and recently published
under the care of Mr. Hardy :

"Hoveden's Annals extend from A.D. 732 to A.D. 1201.
ParsPrima: from A.D. 732 to A.D. 1154. Prom the com-
mencement to the death of Egbert, in 837, his history is
taken from Simeon of Durham, sometimes literally transcribed,
at others condensed. Occasionally, however, Hoveden changes
the collocation, and makes slight verbal alterations. He then
returns to 751,* and takes up Henry of Huntingdon, who is
followed, with a few verbal changes, to the death of Ethel-
red I., in 872. Then follows a recapitulation! f the his-
tory of the "West Saxon Kings from Cerdic, continued to
Henry I. ; not always, however, agreeing with Huntingdon's
History. He then returns to the year 849,^; and again tran-
scribes or abridges Simeon of Durham to the year 1122,
making a few insertions from other sources. From 1122 to
1148, Huntingdon's History is again resorted to, abridged
or transcribed, with a few additions. Prom 1148|| to 1154
Hoveden's History is very brief and confused, and that part
of it relating to Scotland is apparently derived from the same
source as the Chronicle of Melrose.

in taking up Henry of Huntingdon. This change of the text will account
for the apparent oversight noticed in p. 20, n, 68. According to Simeon
of Durham's text, Hoveden makes Eghert to reign thirty-six years and six
months, while, following Henry of Huntingdon, he gives him a reign of
forty years, representing him as dying in 840 or 842.

chiefly relates to a Becket, inserting twenty-eight of his
epistles, three of which are not found in Lupus's edition.
From Christmas 1169 to 1192, Hoveden either abridges or
transcribes Benedictus Abbas, or had access to the same
materials. When he abridges, it is by compression, or by
changing the order of the transaction, relating the events be-
longing to the same transaction connectedly ; whereas Bene-
dictus Abbas, by observing a stricter chronological arrange-
ment, frequently separates them. Hoveden, however, has
inserted entire many letters and charters which are either
omitted or abridged by Benedictus Abbas ; and when he gives
the journal of the expedition of Richard the First's fleet to
Messina, he appears to have had the original document before
him, as his account is fuller than that of Benedictus Abbas.
He also speaks in the first person, as if he were transcribing
the narrative of one that was present, which is not the case
with Benedictus Abbas. Hoveden has also exclusively several
particulars relating to Spain, Portugal, and Scotland. Under
the year 1192 he gives an account of Richard the First's cap-
tivity and deliverance, with a journal of his transactions from
his return to England in March, to his landing in France in the
following May. From that period to the conclusion, his His-
tory is very diffuse, containing many papal bulls and letters,
chiefly Ecclesiastical, relating, as might have been expected, to
the province of York, or to the Northern parts of England,
regulations for courts of law, &c.

" *Some persons have thought that Hoveden continued his
History to the year 1226 ; but this mistake seems grounded
on the continuation which has been ascribed to "Walter of
Coventry, who borrowed both from Hoveden and Benedictus
Abbas, and yet refers to Hoveden alone.

* This appears in the " Monumenta" as a Note to the above extracts.



XH PREFACE.

"It is remarkable that Benedictus Abbas should twice
(pp. 93, 108) mention Hoveden, and that Hoveden, although
he appears to transcribe or abridge Benedictus, should omit all
mention of himself."

THE ANNALS

OF

ROGER DE HOVEDEN.



INTRODUCTION.

AT the beginning of this work, I propose to trace the genea-
logical line of the kings of Northumbria,* down to the times
of those, who, coming after the death of the most venerable
Bede, have not hitherto been treated of.

Ida held the sovereignty twelve years Rafter whose death
Glappa reigned one year. He was succeeded by Adda, whose
reign lasted eight years ; on whose decease Ethelric became
king, and reigned seven years. Theoderic succeeded him, and,
after a reign of four years, lost his life and left the kingdom
to Fridubuld. He, having reigned one year, was succeeded
by Huscus, 2 who, after a reign of seven years, lost his kingdom
and his life. Ethelfred, the most distinguished for valour
among these kings, was the eighth in succession, and reigned
for a. period of twenty-eight years. He was succeeded by
King Edwin, who having embraced Christianity, as king and
martyr ascended to heaven, after a reign of seventeen years.
After him, Oswald, a most Christian king, reigned over Nor-
thuinbria for a period of seven years. He having ascended
to the mysterious realms of heaven, Oswy succeeded him as
king, and held the government twenty-eight years. He being

* It is worthy of remark, that the account here given of the Northum-
brian kings, differs very materially from that of Bede, William of Malrnes-
bury, and the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle.

removed to the realms of bliss, Egfrid received the sovereignty,
and after a reign of fifteen years was slain by the Picts, because
he had unrighteously ravaged Ireland. 3

In his room, his brother Alfred became king, and was suc-
ceeded by his son, Osred, who being slain, Choenred ascended
the throne, and was succeeded by Osric, whose successor was
Ceolwulph, the brother of Choenred. It was to him that Bede,
the historian, dedicated his history of the English.

Having enumerated these, it is my intention to adopt the
history of the most holy and learned Bede as the foundation
of this work, commencing at the last sentence thereof; and,
recording the years of our Lord, carefully reviewing in their
order the reigns of the kings, and briefly, to the best of my
ability, remarking upon the life and miracles of the rest of the
faithful, it is my earnest desire, together with them, to receive
from Christ the reward of everlasting salvation.

Come, thou benign Spirit, who without thine own aid art
never imparted ; bestow thy bounty on my tongue, thou who
in thy bounty dost bestow tongues. 3 *



THE FIRST PART.

IN the year from the incarnation of our Lord 732, as Bede in-
forms us, Bretwald, archbishop of Canterbury, departed this life,
and was buried in the church of St. Peter. In this year,
Tatwin was consecrated archbishop of Canterbury, it being the
fifteenth year of the reign of Ethelbald, king of Mercia. In
the same year, also, king Ceolwulph was taken prisoner, shorn,
and sent back into his kingdom. He was imbued with a
wonderful love for the Scriptures, as the truthful chronicler,
Bede, states in the beginning of his Preface. In the same
year, bishop Acca was expelled from his see, 4 and Cynebert,
bishop of Lindesey,* died.

In the year 733, having received his pall from the Apostolic
See, Tatwin ordained Alwin and Sigfrid bishops. An eclipse

3 In A.D. 684, he had sent his general, Beort, with an army to lay waste
Ireland ; and in the following year, having himself led his troops against
the Picts or Britons at Strath Clyde, he was slain at Drumnechtan, in the
county of Forfar,

of the sun took place on the nineteenth day before the calends
of September, about the third hour of the day, insomuch that
the face of the sun seemed to be almost entirely covered with
a very black and horrible shield.

In the year 734, on the second day before the calends of
February, the moon was covered with a redness like blood for
nearly a whole hour, at about the time of cock-crow ; a darkness
then coming on, she returned to her usual brightness. In the
same year, Tatwin, the new archbishop of Canterbury, died. The
first bishop of this city was Augustine, that famous instructor
of the whole kingdom, and excellent founder of the Christian
faith and religion, to whom, in their order, succeeded Lauren-
tius, Mellitus, Justus, Honorius, Deusdedit, the most learned
Theodore, and Bretwald, whom Tatwin followed, as I have
already mentioned. In the same year, Fridebert was ordained
bishop of Hagustald. 6

In the year 735, Nothelm was ordained archbishop of Can
terbury, and Egbert, bishop of York, was ordained to the arch-
bishopric of the Northumbrians, being the first who, since
Paulinus, had received the pall 7 from the Apostolic See. In
this year the learned Bede departed this life at Jarrow. 8

In the year from the incarnation of our Lord 736, Nothelm,
having received the pall from the pope of Rome, ordained three
bishops, namely, Cuthbert, Eordwald, and Ethelfrid.

In the year 737, bishop Aid win, who was also called Wor,
departed this life, and in his room Witta 9 and Tota were con-
secrated bishops of the Mercians 10 and the Mid- Angles. 11 In
the same year, in place of Ceolwulph, 12 Eadbert, his uncle's
son, received the kingdom of Northumbria.

In the year 738, Swetbrit, 13 king of the East Saxons, died.
In the following year, Ethelherd, king of the West Saxons,
departed this life, on which his brother Cuthred was appointed
king in his room. In the same year, archbishop ISothelm died,
four years after having received the archbishopric, and Adulph,
bishop of Rochester, departed this life.

In the year 740, Ethelwald, bishop of Lindisfarne, departed
to the Lord, and Kinewulph was appointed to that see.
In the same year of sacred memory, bishop Acca was removed
to the realms of the living, after having held the bishopric of
Hagustald twenty-four years, at the east side of which church
his body was honorably interred : afterwards, when more
than three hundred years had elapsed from his burial, in
consequence of a divine revelation, he was removed by a certain
priest, and placed in a coffin within the church, with due
honor, where to the present day he is held in great veneration ;
as a merited proof of his sanctity before all men, the chasuble,
tunic, and sudarium, 14 which had been deposited in the earth
with his most hallowed corpse, preserve even unto this day, not
only their original appearance, but even their original strength
of texture.

In the same year in which the holy bishop Acca departed
to the realms of heaven, Arwin, the son of Eadulph, was slain,
on the ninth day before the calends of January, being the sixth
day of the week. In the same year, Cuthbert received the
archbishopric of Canterbury, being the eleventh archbishop ;
and, in succession to Adulph, Dun became bishop of Rochester.

In the year 741, the monastery in the city of York was
burnt, on the ninth day before the calends of May, being the
first day of the week.

In the year 744, a battle was fought between the Picts and
the Britons ; and in the following year, fiery strokes were beheld
in the air, such as no men of that generation had ever seen before,
and were visible throughout almost all the night of the calends
of January. In the same year also, according to some accounts,
the second Wilfrid, bishop of York, departed to the Lord on the
third day before the calends of May; but it is my opinion, that
before Bede had completed his history, this Wilfrid had been al-
ready translated to the realms of heaven. In these days died
Inguald, bishop of London, and at this time flourished Saint
Guthlac.

In the year 749, died Elfwald, 15 king of East Anglia, upon
which Hunbenna and Albert divided the kingdom between
them. In the following year, that is to say, in 750, king Eadbert

brought bishop Kinewulph prisoner to the city of Bebba,"
and caused the church of St. Peter, in Lindisfarne, to be be-
sieged. 17 Offo, the son of Alfred, was unthinkingly running
with all haste towards the relics of Saint Cuthbert, the bishop,
when he was dragged out of the church, without his weapons,
and almost famished with hunger.

In the same year, bishop Allwich died, and Ardulf, a deacon,
was ordained to the bishopric. 17 * Cuthred, the king of the
West Saxons, rose against Ethelbald, king of Mercia.

In the year from the incarnation of our Lord 752, on the day
before the calends of August, an" eclipse of the moon took place.

In the year 753, Boniface the archbishop, who was also called
Winfrid, with fifty-three others, was crowned with the martyr-
dom of the Franks. In the following year, Cuthred, king of the
West Saxons, died, the sceptre of whose kingdom was received
by Sigebert.

In the year 756, being the fifteenth 18 year of his reign, king
Eadbert, with Unnust, king of the Picts, led an army to the
cities of Alclutit, 19 and there received the Britons of that neigh-
bourhood under their subjection, 6n the first day of August ; but,
on the tenth day of the same month, almost the whole of the
army which he led from Deouama, 19 * was destroyed at Niwam-
birg, that is at the new city. In the same year Baltere, the
anchorite, attained the life of the righteous, and departed unto
the Lord. On the eighth day before the calends of December,
the moon, on her fifteenth day, being about her full, appeared to
be covered with the colour of blood, and then, the darkness
decreasing, she returned to her usual brightness ; but, in a
wondrous manner, a bright star followed the moon, and, pass-
ing across her, preceded her when shining, at the same distance
at which it had followed her before she was darkened.

In the year 757, Ethelbald, king of Mercia, was treach-
erously slain by his own allies. 20 In the same year a civil war

arose among the Mercians, and Beornred being put to flight,
king OfFa was victorious.

La the year 758, king Eadbert voluntarily resigned the king-
dom, which he had received from God, to his son Osulph, who
held it but one year and then lost it, having been treacherously
slain by his own servants near Mechilwongton, on the ninth
day before the calends of August.

In the following year, Ethelwald, who was also called Moll,
began to reign on the nones of August. At the beginning of
the third year of his reign a most severe battle was fought,
near Edwin's Cliff, on the seventh day before the ides of August,
in which, after a fight of three days, Oswin was slain, and thus
king Ethelwald gained the victory. This took place on the first
day of the week. In the same year, Unnust, king of the Picts,
departed this life.

In the year 762 king Ethelwald took Etheldreda for his queen,
on the calends of November, at Cataract. 21 In the third year
from this, that is to say in 764, there was a great snow with
intense frost, not to be compared with any in former ages.
It covered the earth from the beginning of winter almost
until the middle of spring, and through its rigour the trees
and vegetables mostly withered away, and many marine
animals were found dead. In the same year, likewise, Ceol-
wulph, formerly king, and afterwards a servant of our Lord
Jesus Christ and a monk, departed this life.

It was to this king that the truthful Bede wrote the epistle
which begins thus : "To the most glorious king, Ceolwulph,
Bede, servant of Christ, and priest. I formerly, at your re-
quest, most readily transmitted to you the Ecclesiastical His-
tory of the English Nation, which I had newly published, for
you to read and give it your approbation ; and I now send it
again to be transcribed, and more fully considered at your
leisure." The king himself, after renouncing the world, became
a monk in the church of Lindisfarne, and there struggled for a
heavenly kingdom. His body being afterwards brought to the

Saxons, who, having made a treaty of peace with Ethelbald, attacked and
slew him at Seekington ; or it may allude to the version of the story that
he was slain by his own subjects, headed by the rebel Beornred. Lam-
barde reconciles the two versions by suggesting that Cuthred, king of Wes-
sex, invaded Mercia, and conspired with some of Ethelbald's subjects, of
whom Beornred was chief. 21 Catterick, in Yorkshire.



A.D. 764. DEATH OF FBITHWOLD. 7

church at Norham, according to the accounts given by the inhabi-
tants of that place, became famous for working many miracles.
Through the influence of this king, after he had become a
monk, licence was granted to the monks of the church of Lin-
disfarne to drink wine or ale ; for before, they were in the
habit of drinking only milk or water, according to the ancient
rule prescribed by Saint Aidan, the first bishop of that church,
and that of the monks who, coming with him from Scotland,
had received there a settlement by the munificence of king
Oswald, and rejoiced to live in great austerity, with a view to
a future life.

In the same year, many cities, monasteries, and towns, in
various places, and even kingdoms, were laid waste by sudden
conflagrations ; such, for instance, as the city of Sterburgwenta, 22
Homunic, 23 the city of London, the city of York, and Doncaster ;
many other places' also, the same calamity overtook.

In the same year died Frehelm the priest and abbat, and
Tocca, 24 bishop of the Mercians, on which Eadbert was ordained
bishop in his room. At this period, also, Frithwold, bishop
of Whitherne, departed from this world, and Pechtwin was
appointed in his stead. 25

22 This is most probably an error, the name of two places being made
into one. Lambarde in his Dictionary, quoting from Simeon of Durham,
mentions in place of this name, Stretbourgh and Winton, and adds, " by
which order of speech it seemeth that he took it for a great town ; how-
beit, I have not hitherto found it." Holinshed (whether quoting from
Roger de Hoveden, or Simeon of Durham, does not appear,) mentions
here Stretehu and Geivento, places, not improbably, as imaginary as the
Sterburgwenta of our text.

23 It is not clear what place is meant by this name. Holinshed men-
tions it as Alnwick.

24 V. r. Totta.

f M In the text, " Candida Casa," or " the White House." The bishopric
of Whitherne was also called that of the Picts, Abercorn, or Galloway.
Its establishment is thus related by Bede, Eccles. Hist. B. iii. c. 4.
" In year of our Lord 565, when Justin the younger, the successor of
Justinian, had the government of the Roman empire, there came into Britain
a famous priest and abbot, a monk by habit and life, whose name was
Columba, to preach the word of God to the province of the northern
Picts, who are separated from the southern parts by steep and rugged
mountains ; for the southern Picts, who dwell on the side of those moun-
tains, had long before, as is reported, forsaken the errors of idolatry, and
embraced the truth, by the preaching of Ninias, a most reverend bishop
and holy man of the British nation, who had been regularly instructed at

In the year 765, fiery strokes were seen in the air, such as
formerly appeared on the night of the calends of January, as I
have already mentioned. 2fi In the same year Ethelwald lost 27
the kingdom of Northumbia at Wincanheale, m on the third day
hefore the calends of November, and was succeeded in the
kingdom by Alcred, who was a descendant, as some say, of
king Ida. Hemeli, bishop of the Mercians, also departed this
life. Cuthred was ordained bishop of Lichfield; and at the
same period archbishop Bregwin died, and had Lambert for his
successor ; bishop Aldulph also dying, Ceolwulph succeeded
him in the diocese of Lindesey.

In the year 766, Egbert, archbishop of York, rested in the
peace of Christ, on the thirteenth day before the calends of
December, it being the thirty-fourth year of his episcopate;
and in the same year Saint Frithebert, bishop of Hagustald, ^
departed this life.

In the year 767, Albert was consecrated bishop of York, and
Alcmund bishop of Hexham, on the eighth day before the
calends of May. In the same year Albert was ordained bishop
of the East Saxons, and Ceolwulph was consecrated bishop of
Lindesey. In this year also, Etha, the anchorite, died happily
at Cric, 30 a place distant about ten miles from the city of York.

In the year 768, being the tenth year after the abdication
of his kingdom, Eadbert happily breathed forth his spirit,
being a member of the priesthood, and devoted to the service
of God. In the same year died Pepin, king of the Franks,
and Hadwin was ordained bishop at Macuhi. 31

Rome, in the faith and mysteries of the truth ; whose episcopal see,
named after St. Martin the bishop, and famous for a stately church
(wherein he and many other saints rest in the body), is still in existence
among the British nation. The place belongs to the province of the
Bernicians, and is generally called the ' White House,' because he there
built a church of stone, which was not usual among the Britons."

27 This seems to imply that he was deprived of it by treachery or
violence. Holinshed says, " After that Moll had reigned six years, he
resigned his kingdom. But others write that he reigned eleven years,
and was iu the end slain by treason of his successor Altred."

28 Probably Finchale, in Durham ; though Lambarde suggests that
Wighal, near Thorpebares, in Yorkshire, is the place here spoken of.

31 Probably Saint Mesmin de Mici, in the province of Orleans, in France.



A.D. 774. DESCEIPTION OF BEBBANBTJRGH. 9

In the year 769. Cataract 31 was burnt by the tyrant Carnred,
and by the judgment of God, he himself perished by fire in
the same year.

In the year 771, Offa, king of Mercia, subdued in war the
nation of the East Angles. In the same year, Carloman, the
king of the Franks, being attacked by a sudden disease,
departed this life, on which his brother Charles, 32 who had
before possessed half his father's kingdom, acquired the
sovereignty of the whole, and afterwards, by his invincible
bravery, obtained the chieftainship of all the peoples of the
Franks.

In the year 772, Charles, the king of the Franks, having
collected a powerful army and assembled the warlike forces
of his kingdom, invaded the nation of the Saxons, and after
having lost many of his principal and most noble men, betook
himself home.

In the year from the incarnation of our Lord 773, bishop
Hadwin 32 * departed this life, and Leuthfrid was appointed
bishop in his room. Wulfeth also, abbat of Beverley, died,
and Albert, the archbishop of York, received the pall that
had been sent to him by pope Adrian.

In the year 774, duke Eadwulph died, and Alcred being
deprived of the counsel and assistance of his own family and
his chief men, exchanged the dignity of a crown for exile, and
with a few companions of his flight, first betook himself to the
city of Bebba, M and afterwards to the king of the Picts whose
name was Cynoth. The city of Bebba is an extremely well
fortified place, of no great size, but extending over the space of
about two or three fields, having a single approach, hollowed
out [of the rock], and in a wonderful manner raised on high and
ascended by steps ; it has, on the summit of a hill, a church most

beautifully built, in which is a precious shrine, wherein, wrapped
in a pall, lies the right hand of the holy king Oswald, uncornipted,
as Bede, the historian of this nation, relates. There is on the

* western side, and in the highest part of the city, a fountain



31 Catterick, in Yorkshire. 32 Known in history as Charlemagne.

improbable that the bishopric of Orleans is here alluded to ; probably
the same that is mentioned under the year 768.

hollowed out in a marvellous fashion, the water of which is
sweet to drink, and most limpid to the sight.

Ethelred, 34 the son of Ethelwald, reigned in his father's
stead, and, as will appear in the sequel, held the govern-
ment hardly five years. At the same period, Charles, the most
invincible king of the Franks, after having harassed it with a
siege, took Ticinum, the most noble city of the Lombards,
together with king Desiderius himself, and gained possession
of the whole of Italy.

In the year 775, Cynoth, king of the Picts, departed this
life, and duke Eadulph was fraudulently taken prisoner by
stratagem, and after a short time slain, buried, and forgotten.
Abbat Ebbi also died, and king Charles, as I have already
observed, the most warlike of the Franks, being attended
and supported by, and glorying in, the entire might of his
army, entered the country of the Saxon in battle array, and
accompanied by his legions. This district, raging with fire and
sword, he laid waste by most severe conflicts ; inflamed with
furious anger, with a mighty arm he succeeded in adding to
his own supreme empire the cities of Sigeburg and Aresburg, M
and the province of Bohwer, 36 which had been previously over-
run by the Franks.

In the year 777, Pecwin, bishop of Whitherne, departed to
the Lord, and was succeeded by Ethelbert.

In the year 779, Ethelred being expelled from the throne, 37
and driven into exile, was forced to undergo great trials. On
the expulsion of Ethelred, Elfwald, the son of Osulph, re-
ceived the kingdom of Northumbria, and held it ten years. He
was a pious and just king, as a future circumstance will prove.

In the year 780, dukes Osbald and Ethelherd, having collected
an army, burned Beam, the king's patrician, 38 at Seletune, 39
on the ninth day before the calends of January. In the same
year, archbishop Albert departed from this world unto Christ,
Eanbald, while he was yet alive, having been appointed to the

same see. Bishop Kinewulph 40 also, having laid aside the cares of
the world, this year gave up the government of his church, to-
gether with the management of all his household, 41 to Higbald.
In the same year also, bishop Eanbald, having received the
pall which had been sent him from the Apostolic See, was
solemnly invested as archbishop.

In the year 781, Alcmund, bishop of Hagustald, a man of
remarkable piety and of great virtues, departed to Christ, in
the third year of the reign of the glorious king Elfwald, on the
seventh day before the ides of September ; Saint Gilbert 42 suc-
ceeded him.

In the year 783, being the third year of the righteous king
Elfwald, Werburg, who had formerly been queen of the Mercians,
but was then an abbess, departed this life, to live eternally
with Christ. At the same period, bishop Kinewulph departed
to the realms of heaven in the fortieth year of his episcopate.

In the year 786, being the eighth year of king Elfwald,
Bothwin, the venerable abbat of the church of Bipon, in the
sight of his brethren who were present, departed to the king-
dom of heaven, and Albert was elected in his room and or-
dained. In the same year Aldulph was consecrated bishop by
archbishop Eanbald, and bishops Gilbert and Higbald, at Cor-
bridge. 43 In these days, Bictrith, who was formerly a queen,
and afterwards an abbess, departed unto the Lord. At the same
period, Kinewulph, king of the West Saxons, was murdered in
a dreadful manner by the perfidious tyrant Kinebard, and the
cruel assassin, himself, was without mercy slain by duke Osred,
the avenger of his master ; upon which, Brithric received the
kingdom of the "West Saxons. At this time, legates from the
Apostolic See were sent to Britain (the venerable bishop George
being the chief among them) by pope Adrian, to renew among
ms the ancient ties of friendship and the catholic faith, which
Saint Gregory the pope had taught through Saint Augustine :
having been honorably received by the kings and archbishops
or primates of this country, they returned home in peace, with
great presents, as was befitting.

In the year 787, a synod was held at Wincanheale, 44 on the

40 Bishop of Lindisfarne.

fourth day before the nones of September; at this period,
Albert, abbot of Eipon, died, and Sigred succeeded him.

In the year 788, a conspiracy having been formed, king Elf-
wald was slain by a shocking death, by his patrician 44 * Sigga,
the ninth day before the calends of October, at a place
called Siltecester near the wall. 45 The body of this excellent
king was carried by great crowds of monks to the church
of Hagustald, attended with the chaunts of the clergy,
and was honorably buried there, in the church of Saint
Andrew. He was succeeded by his nephew Osred, the son of
king AlcrQd, who reigned one year. In the place where the
good king Elfwald was murdered, a light sent down from
heaven, is said to have been seen by great numbers of people.
A church was built there by the faithful of that place, and
consecrated to the honor of God, and of the saints, Cuthbert
the bishop, and Oswald the king and martyr.

In the year 790, Ethelred was recalled from exile, and again,
by the grace of Christ, seated on the throne of his king-
dom. But king Osred, having been betrayed by the treachery
of his nobles, was deprived of his kingdom and shorn in the
city of York, and afterwards, compelled by necessity, went
into exile. In the second year of his reign, duke Eardulph
was taken prisoner, and was taken to Eipon, and there slain
without the gate of the church by the above-named king. The
brethren having carried his body to the church with Gregorian
chaunts, and then placed it in a tent outside thereof, after
midnight he was found alive within the church.

In the same year Baldwulph was ordained bishop of Whi-
therne, at the place which is called Hearrahaldh, which may
be translated "the place of the lords." For in the preceding
year, bishop Ethelbert left his own see, 47 on the death of Saint
Gilbert, and received the bishopric of Hagustald, as his see.

In the year 791, the sons of king Elfwald were dragged
away by force from the city of York, and, having been enticed
from the principal church by false promises, were shockingly
slain by king Ethelred, at Wonwaldremere ; 48 their names were

Northumberland, is the place alluded to. 47 Of Whitherne.

Elf and Elfwin. In this year also, Lambert, archbishop of
Canterbury, departed to the Lord ; Ethelherd, abbat 49 of the
monastery of Lhuda, was elected his successor and consecrated
archbishop.

In the year 792, Charles, king of the Franks, sent to Britain
a book containing articles agreed upon in a synod, which had
been sent to him from Constantinople; in which book, oh
shame ! there were found many things repugnant and contrary
to the true faith, and especially that it had been unanimously
agreed to by three hundred, or even more, of the various
bishops of the East, that image* ought to be worshipped, a
thing that the Church of God utterly abhors. Against this
Albinus wrote an epistle, wonderfully confirmed by the autho-
rity of the Holy Scriptures, and presented it with the same
book, in the name of our bishops and princes, to the king of
the Franks.

In the same year also, Osred, relying upon the oath and
fidelity of certain nobles, came secretly from Eufania, 50 the
place of his exile ; and then, being deserted by his soldiers,
was taken prisoner by the said king Ethelred, and by his order
slain at a place called Dingburg, on the eighteenth day before
the calends of October. His body was carried to Tyne-
mouth, 81 and buried in the royal tomb, in the noble monastery
there. In the same year king Ethelred took as his queen
Elfleda, the daughter of Offa, king of Mercia, at Cataract, on
the third day before the calends of October.

In the year 793, being the fourth year of the reign of King
Ethelred, dreadful prodigies alarmed the wretched nation of the
English, for terrific lightnings, and dragons in the air, and strokes
of fire were seen hovering on high and shooting to and fro ; which
were ominous signs of the great famine and the frightful and
Ineffable slaughter of multitudes of men which afterwards
ensued. In the same year also, duke Sigga, who slew king
Elfwald, died a merited death, and his body was carried to the
island of Lindisfarne, on the ninth day before the calends of
May.

Lindisfarne is a large island, eight miles or thereabouts in
circumference. In it was a noble monastery, where the illus-

trious bishop Cuthbert was interred, 42 together with other
bishops who most worthily succeeded him. With respect to
them, the words of the chaunt may be appropriately repeated
" The bodies of the saints are buried in peace." M Lindis is
the name of a river which, two feet in width, runs into the
sea. When it is " Ledon," or low tide, the river can be seen ;
but when it is "Malina," or the high tide of the sea, then the
Lindis cannot be seen. The tide of the ocean follows the moon,
and, as though by its inhaling, is raised to high water, and
then, by its breathing forth, is driven back again. It seems
to flow and to ebb twice a day, later each time by three
quarters and 54 half an hour, as Bede testifies. Fame is the
name of an island on which the most blessed Cuthbert passed
the life of a hermit. It is not so large as Lindisfarne, but
is situate out at sea, and is buffeted day and night by huge
billows.

In the same year, the pagans, 85 coming from the northern
regions to Britain with a naval armament, made descents' in all
quarters, plundering, ravaging, and slaughtering, like most
cruel wolves, not only beasts of burthen, oxen and sheep, but
priests and Levites as well, and multitudes of monks and nuns.
They came, as I have observed, to the church of Lindisfarne
and laid waste all places with dreadful havoc, trod down holy
places with their polluted feet, undermined the altars, and
carried off all the treasures of the holy church. Some of the
brethren they slaughtered ; some they carried off" with them
in chains ; a very great number, loaded with abuse, they thrust
out naked, and some they drowned in the sea. With respect
to them, the words maybe appropriately quoted: "Fortune
bears hard upon the lot of the guiltless. Evil is the due punish-
ment of wickedness. The wrong-doers are seated after their wont
on a lofty throne, and the guilty in an unjust manner are tread-
ing upon the necks of the righteous. Bright virtue lies concealed
in obscure shades, and the just suffer the penalties of the wicked."

82 " Positus erat " may either mean that they were located there during
their lives, or that they were buried there. Probably the hitter is the
meaning.

53 " Corpora defunctorum in pace sepulta sunt."

M In the original it is " et." " Aut," " or," would seem to be a more
appropriate reading. The whole passage is involved in considerable oh-
scurity. M The Danes.



A.D. 796. DEATH OF ALEIC. 15

These having retired, congratulating themselves on their booty
and their wicked deeds, I shall recount what misfortunes the
succeeding year brought.

In the year 794, the pagans above mentioned having laid
waste the harbour of king Egfrid, plundered the monastery of
Donum. 56 But Saint Cuthbert did not permit them to depart
without punishment ; for their chief was there slain by the
English, and died a cruel death ; and, after the interval of a
short time, the violence of a tempest wrecked, destroyed, and
foundered their ships, and overwhelmed a vast number in the
sea. TJpon this, some of them were thrown upon shore, and
soon dispatched without mercy ; and this justly befell them, for
they grievously injured those who had not injured them. At that
time Ethelherd died, who was formerly a duke, but then a priest
in the city of York. In the same year the venerable pope
Adrian 57 departed unto the Lord on the seventh day before the
calends of January. He held the See twenty-six years, ten
months, and eleven days. He was buried in the church of
Saint Peter, the prince of the Apostles, and over his tomb a
tablet of marble, fixed against the wall, recounted his good
works, in verses written by the command of king Charles 58 in
letters of gold.

In the year 795, the same most valiant king Charles, having
laid waste their country, with a strong hand, by his arms
subdued the nation of the Huns. Their prince having been
put to flight, and their army worsted or cut to pieces, he car-
ried away thence fifteen waggons filled with gold, silver, and
precious vestments made entirely of silk, each of which was
drawn by four oxen. All these the same king, on account of
the victory which had been granted him by the Lord, ordered
to be divided among the churches of Christ and the poor, re-
turning thanks together with all those who had fought together
with him.

In the year 796, being the seventh year of King Ethelred,
Alric, who was formerly a duke, but then a priest in the
city of York, departed this life; and shortly afterwards, that is

56 This passage is evidently corrupt. The words are " Portum Egfredi

ing passage in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle is, " and plundered Egfert'a

to say, on the fifth day before the calends of April, an eclipse
of the moon took place between the time of cock-crow and day-
break. In the same year, king Ethelred was slain at Cobre,
on the fourteenth day before the calends of May. On this,
Osbald, a patrician, was chosen king by some of the nobles of
that nation ; and after twenty-seven days, being deserted by
all the royal household and the nobles, and banished and ex-
pelled from the kingdom, he retired with a few followers to
the island of Lindisfarne, and went thence with some of the
brethren by ship to the king of the Picts.

Then Eardulph, whom I have previously mentioned, the son
of Earnulph, having been recalled from exile, received the
crown, and on the seventh day before the calends of June,
was consecrated at York, in the church of Saint Peter, before
the altar of Saint Paul, where that nation had first received the
blessings of baptism. Not long after this, that is to say, on
the seventh day before the calends of August, Offa, the most
mighty king of the Mercians, departed this life, after having
reigned thirty-nine years, and was succeeded in the kingdom
by his son Egfrith, who died the same year.

Upon this, Kenulph, the father of Kenelm, received the crown
of the kingdom of Mercia, and gloriously held it in the invincible
power of his might ; in the same year also Ccolwulph died at
Lindesey, and shortly after, that is to say, on the fourth day
before the ides of August, Archbishop Eanbald died at the
monastery called Edete, and his body was carried, with
a vast concourse accompanying it, to the city of York, and
honorably buried there, in the church of Saint Peter the
Apostle. Immediately thereupon, another Eanbald, a priest of
the same church, was elected archbishop, and consecrated at
Sochesburg 59 by bishops Ethelbert, Higbald, and Baldwulph.

In the year 797, this last Eanbald, having received the pall
from the Apostolic See, was solemnly confirmed in the arch-
bishopric of Northumbria, on the sixth day before the ides of
September, being the nativity of Saint Mary; with regard
to which day, the poet says : " With honor shines the day on
which Mary the good virgin, proceeding from the line of king
David, was born unto the world."

In the same year died Ethelbert, bishop of Hagustald, whom

Eadred succeeded, and was ordained by archbishop Eanbald
and bishop Higbald at a place which is called Widford.

In the year 798, a conspiracy having been entered into by
the murderers of king Ethelred, "Wada, the leader in the plot,
together with the others, fought a battle against king Erdulph,
at a place which is called by the English Billingahon, near Wal-
lalalege, and after many were slain on either side, earl "Wada
with his men was put to flight, and king Erdulph bravely
gained a victory over his foes. In the same year, London
was destroyed by a sudden conflagration, together with a vast
multitude of people. t

At this period, Kenulph, king of the Mercians, with all the
strength of his army, entered the province of Kent, and laid it
waste with dreadful slaughter. At the same time, Eadbert,
king of Kent, was taken prisoner, and the king of the Mercians
ordered his eyes to be put out, and his hands to be cut off with-
out mercy, as a punishment for their pride and treachery ; then,
having obtained the suffrage of the Lord, he added the rule of his
kingdom to his own sway, placing the crown upon his head and the
sceptre in his hand. In the same year also, being the third year
of the above-named king Kenulph, a synod was held at the place
which is called "Wincanhele, 60 under the presidency of arch-
bishop Eanbald, many ecclesiastics and men of princely dignity
attending thereat. They devised many things for the benefit of
the Holy Church of God, and of the nation of Northumbria and
all the provinces, as to the observance of Easter, feasts, and
judgments, both holy and secular. These enactments rendered
those days distinguished for just kings, virtuous nobles, and
holy bishops, and other wise men, namely, priests and monks;
through the foresight and justice of whom, and their holy deeds,
the state of the kingdom of Northumbria sent forth a sweet
fragrance in those times. The lord archbishop Eanbald com-
tianded the profession of faith in the articles of the five synods
to be repeated, concerning which it is thus written in the
history of the English : " We do agree to the holy and universal
decrees of the five synods of the fathers, holy and acceptable to
God, in such form as the text of the present book contains," &c.

In the year 799, in the British seas a very great number of
ships were tossed and wrecked, or dashed against each other,
and sunk, together with a vast multitude of men. In the same

year, Brorda, a prince of the Mercians, who was also called
Hyldegils, departed this life. An abbat also, whose name was
Altilthegno, 61 was murdered by his deputy, and died a shocking
death. At this period, Osbald, who was formerly an exile
and a patrician, and king for a time, but afterwards an abbat,
departed this life, and was buried in the church at York. Earl
Aldred, the murderer of king Ethelred, was slain by earl Thor-
mund, in revenge for his master the said king.

In the year 800, Heardred, bishop of Hagustald, 62 died in
the third year of his episcopate, and was succeeded by Ean-
brith. At the same period also, on the ninth day before the
calends of January, the day before the Nativity of our Lord, a
mighty wind blowing either from the south or the west, by its
indescribable force destroyed very many cities, houses, and towns
in various places, and levelled them with the ground ; innumer-
able trees were also torn up from the roots, and thrown to the
ground. In the same year an inundation took place, the sea
flowing beyond its ordinary limits. An extensive murrain also
prevailed among the cattle in various places.

In the year 801, Edwin, also called Eda, who had formerly
been a duke of Northumbria, but was at that time, by the
grace of the Saviour of the world, an abbat, being firmly
rooted in the service of God, breathed his last, in the presence
of his brethren, on the eighteenth day before the calends of
February. At this time, Eardulph, king of Northumbria,
led an army against Kenwulph, king of Mercia, because he had
entertained his enemies ; the latter also collected an army, and
obtained very considerable aid from other kingdoms. A long
war having been waged between them, at length, by the advice
of the bishops and chief men among the English on both sides,
and through the intervention of the king of the Angles, 63 they
agreed to a truce; and a most solemn treaty of peace was
concluded between them, which, by oath upon the gospel of
Christ, both kings ratified, taking God for their witness, and
giving sureties, that all their days, so long as they should
live and be invested with the insignia of royalty, there should
remain between them lasting peace and true friendship, un-
shaken and inviolate.

In the same year Hathubert, bishop of London, departed this
life, and shortly after a great part of the city itself was de-

stroyed by a sudden conflagration. In this year Charles, the
most mighty king of the Franks, was declared supreme emperor
at Rome, by all the senate, the imperial crown being placed
upon his head by our lord the pope.

In the year from the incarnation of our Lord 802, Brithric,
the king of the West-Saxons, who had most gloriously reigned
over that nation for seventeen years, departed this life, and
was succeeded by Egbert. The said king Brithric had taken
in marriage Eadburga, daughter of Offa, king of the Mercians,
who ordered the great dyke to be made between Britain 64 and
Mercia, that is to say, from sea. to sea. Now this Eadburga,
being the daughter of a king and surrounded with much pomp,
was inspired with wonderful ambition, and, after the manner
of her father, began to live in a tyrannical manner and to
despise all men, insomuch that she was hated not only by nobles
and magistrates, but even by all the people. She did not cease
uttering accusations continually against all the religious before
the king, and by her evil speaking so wrought upon her husband
by means of her blandishments, that those whom she accused,
she caused to be put to death or banished the realm ; and if
she was unable to effect this, she did not hesitate secretly to
take them off by poison.

There was at that time a certain illustrious youth, very
dear to the above-named king, and greatly beloved by him,
whom, when she wished to accuse him to the king, and could
not accomplish it, with wicked intent she cut off by poison,
the king in ignorance having tasted which, he expired. But she
had not purposed to give the poison to the king, but to the
youth, whereas the head of all the nobles partaking of it first,
they both drank of the deadly draught, and both perished
through the extremely bitter taste thereof. He being slain by
f eason of this wicked deed, this most wicked poisoner was
smitten with fear, and crossing the seas in her flight with in-
numerable treasures, repaired to Charles, the most famous king
of the Franks.

As she stood before him in his chamber, and offered the
king precious gifts, he thus addressed her ; " Choose, Eadburga,
which of the two you would prefer, myself or my son, who is
standing with me in the room ;" on which she, without any deli-
beration, foolishly made answer and said ; " If the option were
** Meaning Wales.

given me, I would sooner choose your son than yourself, be-
cause he seems to be the younger;" on which king Charles is
said to. have replied : " If you had chosen me, you should
have had my son, but inasmuch as you have chosen him, you
shall have neither me nor him for your own." However, on
account of her wickedness, the king conferred on her a most
excellent monastery, in which, laying aside her secular dress,
and hypocritically assuming the garb of the nuns, she spent a
very few years. For as this execrable woman lived wickedly
in her own country, so much more the miserably and wickedly
was she discovered to have been living in a foreign land. For, a
short space of time having elapsed, while by some she was
supposed to be performing her appropriate duties, she was de-
bauched by a certain low fellow of her own nation. " Let
cloudy error give way before justice ; let it cease, in fact, to
seem a wondrous thing, that a woman should be taken in
adultery." There is nothing for one to wonder at ; " Nothing
is there concealed which shall not be known."

After this, by order of the emperor Charles the Great, she was,
with great weariness and anguish of mind, expelled from her
holy monastery, and, exposed to the reproaches of all, passed
the rest of her life in poverty and misery ; attended to the last
by one poor servant, and begging daily at houses and castles
and in cities, she died miserably at Pavia. 65

Brithric, the glorious king of the West-Saxons, being dead,
king Egbert succeeded him in the rule and sway, and, spring-
ing from the royal stock, placed the diadem of the whole king-
dom on his head, being encircled with a most ample crown.
For he was a most active man, and, distinguished for his
power, he subjected many realms to his dominion. He reigned
thirty-six years and seven months.

To Egbert succeeded his most mighty son Etb.Qlyulph,
who by his noble wife had four sons, whose names were Ethel-
bald, Ethelbert, Ethelred, and Alfred, all of whom in turn
succeeded to the kingdom.

Cuthred, therefore, 66 the above mentioned king of Wessex,
after having conquered the most valiant earl Edelhun, 67 as I
have already 68 mentioned elsewhere, when, in the thirteenth

begging there. K He now reverts for a period of about fifty years.

year of his reign, he was no longer able to endure the exactions
and insolence of Ethelbald, king of Mercia, met him, with his
troops ranged under their banners, at Bereford, 69 having post-
poned all hopes of surviving to liberty. He also brought with
him Edelhun, the above-named warlike earl, who was then
reconciled to him, and relying on whose valour and counsel
he was enabled to incur the hazards of war. On the other
hand, Ethelbald, the king of kings, together with the Mercians,
had brought the men of Kent, and the West Saxons, and
numerous forces of the Angles. The armies, therefore, being
drawn up in battle array, marching straight onward, were draw-
ing close to each other, when Edelhun going before, and bearing
the standard 70 of the king of "Wessex, which was a golden
dragon, pierced the enemy's standard-bearer. On this, an
outcry arising, the party of Cuthred was greatly encouraged,
and immediately thereupon the hostile ranks closed, and
rushed on to mutual slaughter, with dreadful blows and a
terrific crash.

In this battle, with all their pride, the Mercians were so
humbled, that for a long series of succeeding years fortune ren-
dered them subject to "Wessex. Anyone, who had just before seen
the ranks shining with coats of mail, bristling with helmets,
rough with lances, variegated with standards, and resplendent
with gold, might shortly afterwards have seen them steeped in
blood, with lances broken, scattered in ruin, bespattered with
human brains, and frightful to look upon. With determined ob-
stinacy, and displaying the greatest bravery, they rallied beneath
their standards, and waged the combat with swords and battle-
axes, and with direful intent line rushed on against line, each
side having an assured hope of victory. There was no thinking
of flight ; the Mercians were urged on by the swelling pride of
their proud dominion, the men of Wessex were inflamed by the
dread of slavery. But in every direction Edelhun, the above-
named earl, penetrated the ranks, and a road lay open, strewed
with ruin, while in the dreadful carnage his battle-axe was
hewing through both bodies and armour.

Ethelbald, the most valiant king of the Mercians, rushed on
in every direction, and slaughtered the enemy, while to his

most unconquerable sword arms were only like garments,
bones like flesh. "When, therefore, (just like two fires set
in different places, which consume every thing that inter-
venes) it came to pass that the king and the earl met face
to face, each terribly and franticly gnashed his teeth at the
other and shook his right hand and put himself on his guard, and
with mighty blows they both provoked the attack. But the God
who opposes the haughty, depressed the wonted confidence of
mind of the haughty king. When, therefore, he could neither
recover his spirit nor his strength, while his own men were still
engaged, in a fit of terror he took to flight, and from that day to
the time of his death, God granted him no prosperity whatever.
For, four years after this, again engaging 71 at Secandune, 72 after
a dreadful slaughter of his army, disdaining flight, he was slain,
and was buried at Eepandun; 73 and thus this most mighty king,
after he had reigned forty-one years, paid the penalty for his
immoderate pride.

From this period, the kingdom of "Wessex, being greatly
strengthened, did not cease to increase till it had reached perfec-
tion. In the fourteenth year of his reign, Cuthred fought against
the Britons, 74 who, vainly opposing him who had conquered king
Ethelbald, speedily took to flight, and deservedly suffered a very
great slaughter, without any loss to the enemy. In the follow-
ing year, Cuthred, the high and mighty king, illustrious for so
many successes and victories, departed this life.

Sigebert, a relation of the above-named king, succeeded him,
but held the sovereignty for a short time only ; for growing
haughty and insolent, by reason of the exploits of his prede-
cessor, he became intolerable even to his own domestics, as he
ill-treated them in all manner of ways, and either perverted the
common laws of the kingdom to his own advantage, or disre-
garded them for his own profit ; on which, Cumbra, his earl, a
most noble man, at the entreaty of the whole people, acquainted
the cruel king with their complaints ; but when he exhorted
him to act with more moderation, and to treat the people with
kindness, and laying aside his wonted inhumanity, to show him-
self amiable to God and man, the king immediately ordered
him to be killed by an unrighteous death, and becoming more
cruel and more intolerable to his people, proved himself a still

greater tyrant. In the second year of his reign, having per-
sisted in his intolerable pride and wickedness, the nobles and
the people of the whole kingdom met together, and upon mature
deliberation, by the universal consent of all, king Sigebert was
expelled from the kingdom.

On this, Kinewulph, a virtuous young man of royal descent,
was elected king. The impious Sigebert on being banished
by his people, fearing the death that was the due of his
wickedness, took to flight, and concealed himself in a great
wood which is called Andredeswald, 75 where a certain swineherd
of earl Cumbra, who, as I have mentioned, had been iniquitously
slain, found the king in his concealment, and recognized him
when thus found, and becoming the avenger of his master, slew
him when thus recognized. Behold the manifest judgments of
God ! behold how, not only in a future world, but even in this,
he worthily recompenses our deserts. For choosing bad kings
for the merited chastisement of their subjects, one He permits
to rage for long, in order that both a wicked people may long be
harassed, and he, a still more wicked king, may suffer the greater
torments in eternity; as, for instance, Ethelbald, the above-
named king of Mercia. But another one He cuts short with
a speedy end, lest his people, weighed down with excessive
tyranny, may not be able to take breath, and by reason of the
immoderate wickedness of the ruler, may deservedly incur the
speedy retribution of the eternal vengeance ; as, for instance,
this Sigebert of whom we are speaking, who in as great a degree
as he proved himself wicked, was as disgracefully slain by a
swineherd, and passed from one calamity to another. For
which reason, to the eternal justice be praise and glory, now
and for ever !

In the first year of king Kinewulph, Beornred succeeded
JEthelbald, king of Mercia, in the kingdom, but only for a short
time. For in the same year Offa expelled him, and reigned
over Mercia thirty-nine years. Offa, a most noble youth, was the
son of Winfred, the son of Kanwulph, the son of Osmod, the son
of Epa, the son of Wippa, the son of Creada, the son of Kine-
wald, the son of Cinbba, the son of Hycis, the son of Comer,

" 5 This wood is considered by Lambarde to have been in Kent, and the
part which is now called the Weald of Kent. The place, however, at
which Sigebert was slain is mentioned as Privet's-flood, and is supposed to
be the same as Privett, in Hampshire.



24 ANNALS OF BOGEB DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 763.

the son of Ageltheu, the son of Offa, the son of "Wermund,
the son of Widaet, the son of "Woden. 76

Offa was a most warlike king ; for he conquered the people
of Kent in battle, and Vanquished in war the people of Wessex
and the Northumbrians. He also shewed himself a pious man,
for he transferred the bones of Saint Alban to a monastery which
he had built and greatly enriched, and gave to the pope of
Home, the vicar of St. Peter, a fixed tribute for ever, from each
town in his kingdom. 77

In the third year of king Kinewulph, Eadbert, king of the
Northumbrians, seeing the unfortunate lives and unhappy ends
of the above-named kings, (namely, Ethelbald and Sigebert,)
and at the same time the praiseworthy life and glorious end
of his predecessor Ceolwulph, chose that better part which
could not be taken away from him. For having resigned
his kingdom, he assumed the tonsure of his head, destined to
produce for him an everlasting crown, and put on the dark-
coloured clothes that were to confer on him an ethereal splendour.
He was the eighth of those kings who of their own accord gave
up their kingdoms for Christ, or rather, to speak more truth-
fully, exchanged them for an eternal kingdom ; which eight
are in the everlasting enjoyment of the multiplied delights of
unspeakable blessings, and their blessed example is worthy of
imitation.

He was succeeded in the kingdom by his son Osulf ; who
after he had reigned one year, was infamously betrayed by
his own household, and slain.

After him, Mollethelwald 78 reigned nine years. About this
time archbishop Cuthbert 79 died.

In the sixth year of the reign of king Kinewulph, Ethelbert,
king of Kent, departed this life. In the same year, Ceolwulph,
who, having resigned his earthly kingdom, had become a
monk, departed unto a heavenly one. In the following year,

76 Roger of Wendover differs considerably in the names, and gives two
more ancestors to Offa before Woden. His words are, " the son of Ware-
mund, who was the son of Withleg, who was the son of Wagon, who was
the son of Frethegeath, who was the son of Woden."

7 7 This is the Rome-scot, or St. Peter's pence, which consisted of a
penny from each house, payable on the festival of Saint Peter. According
to some accounts, it was Ina who made the first grant of it to the Papal see.

759, by the name of Ethelwald, surnamed Moll.

A.D.779. CONVERSION OP THE ANCIENT SAXONS. 25

Lambert was made archbishop of Canterbury. After having
reigned six years, Mollethelwald resigned 80 the kingdom of Nor-
thumbria ; after him Aelred reigned eight years, in the second
year of whose reign, Egbert, archbishop of York, departed this
life, after having enjoyed the archbishopric for a period of
thirty.-six years : Frithebert, bishop of Hagustald, 81 also died,
after having been bishop thirty-four years.

Archbishop Egbert was succeeded by Adelbert, 82 and Alc-
mund succeeded bishop Fridebert.

In the fourth year of king Aelred, died Pepin, king of the
Franks, Stephen, pope of Rome, and Eadbert, 83 the son of Hecta,
a most famous duke of [East] Anglia.

In the year of grace 769, in the fifteenth year of king Kine-
wulph, a wondrous mutation first began to take place. 84 For
the Roman empire, which had for so many years continued to
enjoy pre-eminence, became subject tp Charles the Great, king
of the Franks. This took place after thirty years of his reign,
which first commenced in this year, 85 and from that time for-
ward, down to the present day, it has belonged to his successors.

In the twentieth year of king Kinewulph, king Offa and the
Mercians fought against the people of Kent at Ottanforde, 86
and after a dreadful slaughter on both sides, the illustrious
Offa was crowned with success. In the same year, the
Northumbrians expelled their king Aelred from Eworwic, 87 in
Easter week, and chose for their king, Ethelred, the son
of Mollethelwald, who reigned four years. In this year were
seen dreadful signs in the heavens after sunset, of a red color; 88
and, to the great astonishment of people, serpents were seen in
Sussex.

the English nation is descended, were converted to the faith,
and in the same year,Withwin, 89 bishop of Whitherne, departed
this life, in the twenty-fourth year 90 of his episcopate.

In the twenty-fourth year of his reign, Kinewulph fought
against Offa, near Benetune ; 91 being humbled by the fortune
of war, he retreated, 92 and Offa reduced that fortified place to
subjection. In the same year, Ethelbert was consecrated at
Eworwic, 93 bishop of Whitherne.

In the following year, Ethelbald and Herebert, earls of the
king of Northumbria, rebelled against their master, and slew
Aldulph, the son of Bose, general of the king's army, in a
pitched battle at Kingesdiwe ; 94 and afterwards in a great battle,
the same generals slew Kinewulph and Egga, the king's earls,
at Hilatirn. Upon this, the above-named king Ethelred,
having lost his generals and ,his hopes, fled from before them,
and they elected Alfimod 95 king, who reigned for a period of
ten years. In the following year, the nobles and high-reeves
of Northumbria burned a certain earl and justiciary of theirs, 97
who had shown himself more severe than was befitting. In the
same year, archbishop Esbert" died at Cestre, 1 and was suc-
ceeded by Enbalo. In this year, Kinebald was made bishop
of Lindisfarne. In the same year also, a battle took place
between the Pranks and Ancient Saxons, the Pranks being
the conquerors.

In the next year, Alfinild, king of Northumbria, sent to
Rome for the pall, and gave it to archbishop Embald. 2 At
the same period, Gilbert succeeded Alcmund, bishop of Ha-

gustald, 8 who had lately died. About this time, there was
a synod held at Ade. 4 After Kinewulph had reigned twenty-
six years, and, being victorious, had gained many battles against
the Britons, 5 and subdued them on every side, 6 at length, he
determined on banishing a certain young man, named Kineard,
the brother of Sigebert. Upon this, he attacked the king at
Meretune, 7 whither he had privately gone to visit a certain
female. On finding this to be the case, the king stoutly defended
himself at the door, until he caught sight of the youth, upon
which he rushed out and wounded him, whereon all his con-
federates turned upon the king, and slew him On the uproar
being heard, the king's soldiers, who were in the town, ran
towards the youth, and refusing gifts of lands and money
that were offered by him, all died bravely fighting, with the
exception of one Briton, who was severely wounded, and taken
as a hostage. In the morning, the soldiers of the king, who
were near at hand in waiting, 8 when the king was slain, hem-
med in the young man and his confederates; on which he thus
said to them ; " Your kinsmen are on my side ; I will give
you lands and money to your hearts' content, if you will not
fight against us ; I made the same offer to your companions,
and refusing it they perished !" To this they made answer,
that no money was dearer to them than their lord, and that
they would avenge the death of their king and their com-
rades ; and then rushing on, after a severe combat at the
door, they slew the young man and eighty-four others who
were with him. The only one left was a little son of the
young man, and he received a wound. Kinewulph was buried
at Winchester, in the thirty-first year of his reign, the young
man at Acsminster. 9

succeeded Kinewulph, and reigned over Wessex sixteen years.
In his second year, pope Adrian sent legates into Britain, to re-
new the faith which Augustine had preached. Being honorably
received by the kings and the people, they raised a fair edi-
fice upon a firm foundation, the mercy of Christ co-operating
with them. They held a council at Cealtide, 10 where lambert 11
resigned a portion of his episcopate ; there also Higbert was
elected 12 by king Offa. In the same year, Egfrid was con-
secrated king of the province of Kent. 13

In the following year, being the year of grace 786, there
appeared a sign 14 upon people's clothes, which may be justly
deemed marvellous to be mentioned and to be heard of. Whether
this took place as a forewarning of the movement relative to
the recovery of Jerusalem, and the assumption of the cross, 15
which happened three hundred and eleven years after this
period, in the time of William 16 the younger, or whether it
was rather intended for the correction of the people, lest they
should not view the plague of the Danes with which they
were shortly afterwards afflicted, in the light of a chastisement,
I will not rashly undertake to settle, but, the mysteries of God
I leave to God. 17

In the fourth year of his reign, Brithric took to wife Ead-
burga, the daughter of Offa, king of Mercia. Strengthened
on the throne by this alliance, he gave way to pride. In these
days, the Danes came to Britain, with three ships, for the sake
of plunder ; the king's reeve in that province, seeing this, went
to meet them without taking due precautions, in order that, hav-
ing captured them, he might carry them to the king's town ; 19
for he was ignorant who they were, or for what purpose they
had come ; but, being immediately surrounded by them, he was
slain. He was the first person of the English nation slain by

the Danes, and after him many thousands of thousands were
slaughtered by them at different periods ; these too were the
first ships of the Danes that arrived here.

In the following year, a synod was held in Northumbria, at
Wincanhele. 20

In the sixth year of king Brithric, a synod was held at
Aclea. 21 By infamous treachery, Sigga slew Alwulph, the good
king of Northumbria. In the same spot where this king, the
beloved of God, was slain, a heavenly light was often beheld ;
his body was buried in the church of Hagustald. After him,
Osred began to reign, but in the following year was betrayed,
and expelled from the kingdom.

Ethelred, the son of Mollethelwald, was then restored to the
kingdom ; and in the fourth year of his reign, having collected
forces for the purpose, Osred was on his return, in order that he
might expel Ethelred from the kingdom, by whom he himself
had been expelled. On his route he was captured and put to
death, and buried at Tynemouth. How just then his remark,
who said, " Oh, how blind to the future is the mind of man !"
For when the above-mentioned youth Osred, dancing and elated
with joy, was made king, how little did he think that in the
second year from that time, he should be deprived of his
throne, and in the fourth, of his life ! For which reason, let
us ever be thoughtful in prosperity, being ignorant how near
at hand adversity may be.

At this time, Offa, king of the Mercians, ordered the head
of Saint Ethelbert 21 * to be cut off, and in these days, Lambert,
archbishop of Canterbury, departed this life, and abbat Ethel-
red was elected in his room archbishop of Canterbury. Ean-
bald, archbishop of York, consecrated Badulph, a bishop of
Whitherne.

In the tenth year of king Brithric, there were seen fiery
dragons flying through the air, which tokens were followed by
two plagues ; first, a dreadful famine, and then the pagan na-
tions coming from Norway and Denmark. These first ravaged
the kingdom of Northumbria in a frightful manner, and then,
in the district of Lindisfarne, on the ides of January, dreadfully
destroyed the churches of Christ, together with the inhabitants ;
at which period also, died Sigga, the perfidious duke who had
acted the traitor towards the righteous king Elfwald.

23 A mistake for Eadulph. He was the last bishop of Whitherne.



30 ANNALS OF EOGEB DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 799.

In the eleventh year of king Brithric, that is to say, in the
year of grace 795, the Northumbrians slew their king, Ethel-
red, who, in the same year in which king Osred was slain, be-
coming elated with pride, had forsaken his own wife and
taken a new one, little thinking that he himself was des-
tined to be slain within two years from that time. After him
Herdulph obtained the kingdom of Northumbria, and was
consecrated king by archbishop Embald, 23 bishop Ethelbert
and bishop Hingbald, and bishop Baldulph, and ascended the
throne at York.

In these days pope Adrian and the great king Offa, departed
this life ; this Offa reigned with mighty sway in Mercia, during
a period of thirty-nine years. He subdued Kenulph, king of
Wessex, and the people of Kent and Northumbria.

King Offa was succeeded by his son Egfrith, who reigned
one hundred and forty-one days, and then died ; he was suc-
ceeded by Kenulph, the father of Kenelm, a most powerful
king. 24 In the same year, Eadbert, who also bore the name
of Pren, obtained the kingdom of Kent. The pagan nations
laid waste Northumbria, and sacked the monastery of Egfrid
at Tynemouth ; they were there met by the most noble of the
English, men extremely well inured to war, and, their chieftains
being slain, the barbarians were overcome, and betook themselves
to their ships. When they had reached the sea, they continued
their flight with their ships, on which some of them were
wrecked by a tempest, and many of them drowned ; but some
of them coming ashore were taken, and were beheaded near
the sea-shore.

Not long after this, Kenwulph, king of Mercia, laid waste the
province of Kent, and captured Pren, who was not a match
for him in might, and had consequently concealed himself in
hiding-places and out-of-the-way spots, and carried him back
with him in chains.

In the fourteenth year of king Brithric, the Romans cut
out the tongue of pope Leo, and put out his eyes, and expelled
him from his see ; but he, as written documents inform us,
through the grace of Christ, was enabled again to see and to

23 Eanbald.

24 The word " marls " seenjs out of place here, as no definite meaning
can be attached to it, unless it is meant to say that Keiielin was a man,

speak, and once more became pope. Three years after this,
king Charles was made emperor, and having been consecrated
by the same pope Leo, condemned those to death who had ill-
treated the pope, but afterwards, by reason of the pope's en-
treaties, he saved their lives, and sent them into exile.

Three years after this, Brithric, king of Wessex, also departed
this life, after he had most gloriously reigned over that nation
seventeen years, having in ignorance taken some poison, which his
wifeEadburga, the daughter of king Ofla, had prepared for a cer-
tain young man ; in consequence of which, they both died, as I
have mentioned more at large above. At this time a great battle
was fought in Northumbria, at Wellehare, 25 in which perished
Alric, the son of Herbert, and many others with him. The
extreme perplexity that would result, necessarily prevents me
from entering into a full description of the circumstances,
fluctuations, and results of the wars ; for the nation of the En-
glish was naturally hardy and proud, and in consequence inces-
santly engaged in intestine warfare.

Egbert 25 * therefore, in the year of grace 800, or, according to
some, 802, being the eighth in order of ten most valiant kings,
whom I have elsewhere remarked, as pre-eminently distin-
guished for their singular merits, on the death of Brithric
succeeded to the throne, and reigned thirty-seven years and
seven months over the kingdom of Wessex. At a youthful
age, his predecessor Brithric, and Offa, king of Mercia, had
banished him from this country. He was in exile three years
at the court of the king of France, but behaved himself nobly
and discreetly. On the death of the above-named king, he
returned and gained the kingdom. On the same day, earl
Ethelmund returned from "Wicum, 28 and, coming to Kinemeres-
forde, 27 met earl "Wistan with the men of "Wiltshire, and
the^re they fought, and both earls being slain, the Wiltshire
men gained the victory.

25 This is probably an error for Wellham, or Wylam, in Northumberland.
Lambarde says, " In the beginning of the reign of King Egbert, one of
the great monarchs of this realm, there was a great battle fought at a
place in the north country, called then \Velham, which I take to be now
called Wyllom in Coupland."

In the fourth year after this, died Ethelred, archbishop of
Canterbury, and was succeeded by "Wilfred, and two years
after, Cuthred, king of Kent, departed this life.

In the following year, Hardulph, king of Northumbria, was
expelled from his kingdom.

In the fourteenth year of his reign, Egbert overran the ter-
ritories of the Britons 28 from east to west, and there was no one
who could even attempt to make resistance to his prowess.

In the year after this, Charles, king of the Franks and
emperor of the Romans, departed this life ; and in the follow-
ing year, Saint Leo, the pope, having died, Stephen succeeded
him, who in his turn was succeeded by Paschal.

Shortly after this, Kenwulph, king of Mercia, departed this
life, and was succeeded by Ceolwulph ; but in the third year
after this, he lost his kingdom, and Beornwulph gained pos-
session of it.

In the fourteenth 29 year of his reign, Egbert fought a battle
with Beornwulph, king of Mercia, at Ellendune, 30 by reason of
which, an old saying mentions that, " The river Ellendune was
red with gore, choked up with carnage, and stinking with putre-
faction." After a very great slaughter there of both nations,
Egbert was the melancholy conqueror. After this, pursuing
his successes, he sent his son Ethelwulph, who afterwards be-
came king, and bishop Alcstan, 31 and earl Walhard, with a great
army, into Kent ; on which they drove Balred, the king, be-
yond the Thames. King Egbert then received the people of
Surrey, and Kent, and Sussex under his subjection, of whom
his kinsman, Pren, had formerly been unjustly deprived. In
this year also, the king of East Anglia, together with his people,
acknowledged king Egbert as his protector ; and after this, in
the same year, the East Angles slew Bernulph, king of the
Mercians, who was succeeded by Ludecen.

In the same year there was a very great battle between the
Britons 32 and the people of Devonshire, at Gavelford, 33 where-
many thousands of men were slain on both sides.

In the following year, Ludecen, king of Mercia, and five
earls, were slain.

A.D. 842. DEATH OF EGBERT. S3

In the twenty-seventh year of his reign, Egbert expelled
Wilaf, king of Mercia, who had succeeded king Ludecen, and
possessed himself of the kingdom. As he had now gained
possession of all the kingdom on the south side of the Humher,
he led an army to Dore 34 against the Northumbrians ; on which,
submissively offering concord and obedience to the great king,
they were peacefully reduced to subjection.

In the following year, king Egbert led an army into North
Wales, and subjected it by force of arms.

In the succeeding year, Wilfred, archbishop of Canterbury,
died, and was succeeded by Ceolnoth.

In the thirty-eighth 35 year of king Egbert, an army of Danes
returned to England ; and shortly after, they were vanquished
at Danemute, 36 and put to flight. Shortly after this, they ravaged
Sepey, 37 on which king Egbert with his forces fought against
them, they having come thither with thirty-five very large
vessels. In the following year he fought against them at
Carra, 38 and there the Danes gained the victory, and two bishops,
Herefred 39 and Wilfred, 40 with two dukes, Dudda and Osmod,
were slain.

In the following year, a naval force of the Danes came into
West Wales, on which the Welsh united with the Danes and
made an attack upon king Egbert. The king, however, en-
joying success, gloriously repulsed them, and, valiant as they
were, bravely routed them at Hengistendune. 41

In the year after this, Egbert, the great king and mo-
narch of Britain, departed this life, after having made his
sons heirs to the kingdoms of which he was in possession,
appointing Ethelwulph king of Wessex, and Ethelstan king of
Kent, Sussex, and Essex. But as we have now come to the mo-

it was either in Cornwall, or not far off."

narchies of England, and to the frightful plague which afflicted
us in the descents of the Danes, the book may be made appro-
priately devoted to a new subject.

At the beginning 41 of my history, I have mentioned that
Britain was afflicted with five plagues ; the fourth of which,
namely, that caused by the Danes, I shall treat of in the pre-
sent book, and the more so, as this was far more dreadful and
caused far more bloodshed than the others. For the Romans kept
Britain under their subjection during only a short period, and
ruled it gloriously by the laws of the conquerors. Again, the
Picts and the Scots made frequent irruptions into Britain on the
northern side, but, still, they did not attack it in every quarter,
and on being sometimes repulsed with loss, they not unfrequently
paused in their invasions. Again, the Saxons, using all their
endeavours, gradually gained the land by warfare : when
gained, they kept possession of it ; when in their possession,
they built upon it ; when built upon, they ruled it with their
laws. The Normans also, who speedily and in a very short
time subdued this country, granted to the conquered their lives,
their liberty, and the ancient laws of the realm, upon which
matters I shall enlarge at the proper time.

On the other hand, the Danes continually and perseveringly
harassed the land, and in their incursions shewed a desire not
to keep possession of it, but rather to lay it waste, and to
destroy everything, not to obtain rule. If at any time they
were overcome, no benefit resulted therefrom, for on a sudden
a fleet and a still greater army would make its appearance in
another quarter ; and it was a matter for astonishment how,
when the kings of the English would march to fight with
them on the eastern side, before they approached the troops of
the enemy, a messenger would come in haste and say, "
king, whither are you going ? An innumerable fleet of the
pagans on the southern side has taken possession of the coasts
of England, and, depopulating cities and towns, has ravaged
every place with fire and sword ;" on the same day another
would come running and saying, " king, whither are you
flying? A terrible army has landed on the western side of
England ; if you do not quickly turn and make head against
them, they will think that you have taken to flight, and will

41 He has not previously made any such remark : this and some other
passages would lead us to infer that some portion of the work is lost.



A D. 842. AFFLICTIONS OF THE ENGLISH. 35

pursue you with flames and carnage." On the same day or
the succeeding one, another messenger would come running
and out of breath, and say, "Whither, ye nobles, are you
going? The Danes, leaving their northern regions, have
already burnt your houses, already carried off your property,
tossed your children on the points of their spears, and com-
mitted violence on the wives of some, while those of others
they have carried away with them."

Thus then, both king and people, being distracted by so many
evil rumours and sinister reports, were relaxed both in hands
and heart, and pined away with consternation of mind. Con-
sequently, not even when they were victorious, did they expe-
rience any joy, as usually is the case, nor did they entertain any
assured hopes of safety. The following is the reason why the
justice of God raged so fiercely, and his wrath was so greatly
inflamed against them.

In the primitive church of the English, religion shone forth
with most brilliant lustre, inasmuch as kings and queens, nobles
and princes, as well as bishops of churches, being inflamed with
ardent desire for a heavenly kingdom, sought either the walls
of the monastery or voluntary exile, as I have already shown.
But in process of time all traces of virtue waxed so faint in
them, that they would allow no nation to be their equal for
treachery and wickedness, a thing which is especially notorious
in the history of the kings of Northumberland ; for just as
their impiety has been described in my account of the actions of
the kings, in the same way did men of every rank and station
persist in a course of deceit and treachery, and nothing was
esteemed disgraceful except piety, while innocence was consi-
dered most deserving of a violent death. In consequence, the
Lord Almighty sent down upon them, like swarms of bees,
i*>st bloodthirsty nations, who spared neither age nor sex,
such as the Danes and the Goths, the Norwegians and the
Swedes, the Yandals and the Frisians ; who, from the begin-
ing of the reign of king Ethelwulph down to the time of the
arrival of the Normans and of king William, that is to say, for
a period of three hundred and thirty years, dreadfully afflicted
this country, and laid it waste with desolation far and wide.
Sometimes also, in consequence of the nearness of Britain, as
the avengers and scourges of God for the misdeeds of the
people, they invaded the country of France ; but, having made

these observations, it is time to return to the thread of my
narrative.

In the first year of his reign, Ethel wulph made head against
these enemies in one part of his kingdom; and, as multitudes of
the pagans increased on every side, he sent earl Wulfred,
with apart of his army, to attack some Danes, who, with thirty-
three ships, had effected a landing at Hampton ; 42 on there
meeting with them, after an immense slaughter of the enemy,
gained a glorious victory. King Ethelwulph also sent earl
Ethelhelm, with the levies of Wessex, to attack another army
at Port ;** an engagement taking place, after an obstinate battle
the earl was slain, and the Danes were victorious.

In the following year, earl Herbert fought against them at
Merseware, 44 and the Danes being the conquerors, his own men
were put to flight, and he was slain. In the same year, an army
of the pagans marched through the eastern parts of England,
namely, Lindesey, East Anglia, and Kent, and slew an innu-
merable multitude with the sword.

In the next year after this, coming further inland, the
army of the Danes slew an immense number of people in the
neighbourhood of Canterbury, Rochester, and London.

In the fifth year of his reign, Ethelwulph, with a part of
his army, fought against the crews of thirty-five ships at
Carre, 45 and the Danes were victorious. For, although the

44 Instead of naming the place, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle says : "This
year Herebert, the ealdorman, was slain by the heathen, and many with
him, among the Marshmen." In Ethelwerd's Chronicle the place is called
Merswarum, and Romney Marsh is supposed to be intended under that
name. Lambarde has the following quaint note on this passage : " Henry
Huntingdon, in the Fifth Book of his History, speaking of the conflicts had
with the Danes under the reign of ^Edelwulfe, reports, amongst other
things, that Herebert, an earl, fought with them, at a place which he called
Marseware, and was slain. Matthew Westminster repeateth the same,
and instead of Marseware, setteth down ' apud Marsunarum.' So that
both these, and so many others as have followed them, take, the name
Mersewar for a place, and not for a number of persons. In which, through
ignorance of the Saxon tongue, they have foully erred ; for the Saxon
books say that Herebert was slain, ' and with him many of the Mercians,
or men of Mercia.' So that the history describeth of what country they
were that were slain, but not in what place the slaughter was committed."

number of the ships was but small, still the number of men
on board of them was considerable.

In the fifth year after this, the venerable bishop Alstan and
duke Ernulph with the men of Somerset, and duke Osred
with the men of Dorset, fought against an army of Danes at
Pendredesmuthe, 46 and by the aid of God, slew many of them,
and obtained the glory of a triumph.

In the sixteenth year of his reign, Ethelwulph and his son
Ethelbald, having collected all their forces, fought with a large
army of the barbarians, who had come with two hundred and
fifty 47 ships to Thames-mouth, and had destroyed those cities,
famous and renowned for ages, London and Canterbury, and put
to flight Bretwulph, king of the Mercians, together with his
army ; who never afterwards enjoyed success, and dying in
the following year, was succeeded by Burrhed. After this, the
Danes growing still bolder, all their forces were collected in
Surrey, and they met the king's troops at Akelea/ 8 In con-
sequence, a battle was fought between these two great armies,
so mighty and so severely contested, that no person had ever
before heard of such a battle being fought in England. You
might behold warriors sweeping onward on either side, just
like a field of standing corn, rivers of blood flowing and rolling
along in their streams the heads and limbs of the slain ; but
it would be an act of excessive and over-nice fastidiousness to
attempt to describe individual exploits. In short, God granted
the fortune of war to the faithful, and those who put their trust
in him, but to his enemies and contemners defeat and indescri-
bable confusion. King Ethelwulph therefore, being conqueror
in this mighty battle, gained a glorious triumph.

In the same year, Ethelstan, king of Kent, and duke Eal-
red 49 fought a naval battle against the Danes at Sandwich, and
laving made a great slaughter of the enemy, captured nine of
their ships, on which the rest took to flight. Earl Cheorl, also,
with the men of Devonshire, fought against the pagans at
Wienor, 50 and having killed a great number of them, was victo-
rious. Consequently, this year was one of good fortune to the

English nation. This, however, was the first year in which
the army of the pagans remained throughout the whole of the
winter, which they did in the isle of Teneit. 51

In the eighteenth year of his reign, Ethelwulph materially
assisted Burrhed, king of the Mercians, in subjugating the people
of North Wales, and gave him his daughter in marriage. He
had four sons, who were all kings in succession, namely, Ethel-
bald, Ethelbert, Ethelred, and Alfred. This Alfred his father
sent, when he was a child five years old, in the year above-
mentioned, to Rome, to the court of pope Leo ; the same pope
afterwards pronounced his blessing on him as king, and treated
him as his own son. This year, duke Ealhere, with the men of
Kent, and Huda, with the men of Surrey, fought against an
army of the heathens in Teneit, and a great multitude on either
side was slain, or perished by shipwreck, and both the above-
named dukes lost their lives.

Ethelwulph, the illustrious king of Essex, in the nineteenth
year of his reign, set apart a tenth of all the lands in his realm,
and bestowed it upon the church, for the love of God, and for
his own salvation. Afterwards, he went to Rome in great
state, and took with him his son Alfred, whom he loved more
than the others. There he remained one year, and on his
return thence, took the daughter of Charles the Bald, king of
France, to wife, and brought her with him into this country ;
after having lived with her two years, he died, and was
buried at Winchester. He had at first been bishop of that
city, but on the death of his father, Egbert, being compelled by
necessity, he was made king, and, having married a noble wife,
became father of the four sons above-named. About this
period, the pagans passed the whole winter at Sepey, that is to
say, " the island of sheep."

The above-named king, on his decease, left to his son, Ethel-
bald, his hereditary kingdom of Wessex, and to Ethelbert,
another son, the kingdom of Kent, with Sussex and Wessex.
Both the brothers being young men of excellent natural dis-
position, held their kingdoms without the slightest molestation
as long as they lived.

Ethelbald, the king of Wessex, after he had reigned
peacefully for five years, was cut off by a premature death.

51 Thanet. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle mentions the isle of Sheppey
here, and makes it some years later.



A.D. 900. THE KINGS OF WESSEX. 39

All England bewailed the youthful age of Ethclbald, and there
was great mourning for him ; he was buried at Sherburne, and
England was afterwards sensible what a loss she had expe-
rienced in him.

Ethelbert, the brother of the above-mentioned king, reigned
after him in Wessex, having been previously king of Kent.
In his days a naval force came, and having attacked Winches-
ter, destroyed it ; thus " fell the ancient city that for many a
year had borne the sway."

Ethelbert, dying ten years after, was succeeded by Ethel-
red, who, after reigning six years, was succeeded by king
Alfred, whose reign lasted twenty-eight years. His genealogy,
together with his actions and the events of his time, are de-
scribed below.

In the year from the incarnation of our Lord 849, Alfred,
king of the Anglo-Saxons, was born in the district called Berk-
shire j 53 the following is the order of his genealogical line .
King Alfred was the son of king Ethelwulph, who was the
son of Egbert, who was the son of Ealmund, who was the son
of Eafeo, who was the son of Eoppa, who was the son of
Ingild. Ingild, and Ina, the famous king of the West Saxons,
were two brothers ; this Ina went to Rome, and there ending
this life, entered a heavenly country, there to reign with
Christ. They were the sons of Coenred, who was the son of
Ceolwald, who was the son of Cutha, who was the son of Cuth-
win, who was the son of Ceaulin, who was the son of Cynric,
who was the son of Creda, who was the son of Cerdic, who
was the son of Elesa, who was the son of Elta, who was the son
of Gewis, from whom the Britons call all people of that nation
by the name of Gewis ; 54 he was the son of Wig, who was the

53 At Wantage.

54 He probably alludes to the West Saxons, or people of Wessex, who
were called Gewissae.

son of Freawin, who was the son of Freoderegeat, who was
the son of Brand, who was the son of Bealdeag, who was the
son of Woden, who was the son of Friderwald, who was the son
of Frealaf, who was the son of Friderwulph, who was the son
of Fingoldulph, who was the son of Geta, (which Geta the
pagans long worshipped as a god,) who was the son of Cetua,
who was the son of Bean, who was the son of Sceldua, who
was the son of Heremod, who was the son of Itermod, who
was the son of Hathra, who was the son of Wala, who was
the son of Beadwig, who was the son of Shem, who was the
son of Noah, who was the son of Lamech, who was the son of
Methusaleh, who was the son of Enoch, who was the son of
Malaleel, who was the son of Canaan, who was the son of
Enos, Avho was the son of Seth, who was the son of Adam.

The mother of Alfred was named Osburg, an extremely
pious woman, noble by nature, noble too by birth ; she was
the daughter of Oslac, the famous butler of king Ethelwulph ;
who was a Goth by nation, inasmuch as he was descended
from the Goths and Jutes, of the seed of Stuf and Withgar,
two brothers and earls; who, having received possession of
the isle of "Wight from their uncle, king Cerdic, and his
son Cinric, their cousin, slew the few British inhabitants they
could find in that island, at a place called Withgaraburgh ; 55
for the rest of the inhabitants of the island had been either
slain or had escaped into exile.

In the year 851, Cheorl, earl of Devonshire, with the men
of Devon, fought against the Danes and defeated them. In
the same year a great army of the pagans came with three
hundred and fifty ships to the mouth of the river Thames, and
sacked Dorobernia, that is, the city of Canterbury, and put to
flight Bretwulph, king of the Mercians, who had come to
appose them.

After this, the Danes growing more bold, all their army was
collected in Surrey. On hearing this, Ethelwulph, the mighty
warrior, with his son, Ethelbald, collected an army at the place
which is called Akelea, 56 and, engaging with the pagans, he
defeated them with unheard-of slaughter.

In the year 852, Berthwulph, king of the Mercians, departed
this life, and was succeeded by Burrhed. In the same year,

85 It is supposed that this may have been Carisbrook, in the isle of
Wight. x Ockley, in Surrey.

king Ethelstan and earl Elchere, conquered a great army of the
pagans at Sandwich, and after slaying nearly all of them, took
nine of their ships.

In the year 853, Burrhed, king of the Mercians, supported by
the assistance of king Ethelwulph, attacked the Mid-Britons, 57
and having conquered them, reduced them to subjection. In
the same year, king Ethelwulph sent his son Alfred, who was
then five years old, to Rome with a great escort of nobles ; on
which, Saint Leo, the pope, at the request of his father, ordained
and anointed him for king, and, receiving him as his own adopted
son, confirmed him, and sent him back with his blessing to his
father.

In the year 854, "Wulfred, having received the pall, was
confirmed in the see of York, Osbert being king of Northum-
bria; Eardulph also received the bishopric of Lindisfarne. At
this period, earl Alchere with the men of Kent, and duke
Wada, with the men of Surrey, fought a severe battle in the isle
of Tened 58 against the pagans, and after routing them at the
first onset, at length, after very many had fallen on either side,
both the noblemen were slain. This year, Ethelwulph, king
of the West Saxons, gave his daughter in marriage to Burrhed,
king of the Mercians, at the royal town which is called Cyp-
panhame, 89 with a great profusion of all kinds of riches.

In the year 855, a great army of the pagans passed the whole
of the winter in the isle of Sceapeye, 60 that is to say, " the
island of sheep." In the same year, king Ethelwulph released
the tenth part of the whole of his kingdom from all royal
service and tribute, and with an everlasting pen 61 at the cross
of Christ, offered it up to the One and Triune God, for the re-
demption of his soul and those of his predecessors. He also
proceeded with great pomp to Rome, and taking with him
his son Alfred, whom he loved more than his other sons, and
whom he had before sent to Rome, now for the second time,
remained there a whole year, on the completion of which, he
returned to his own country, bringing with him Juthina, 62 the
daughter of Charles, king of the Franks. After his return
from Rome he lived two years.

Among the other good works that he did, he ordered every

year to 'be taken to Rome three hundred monetises of money;
a hundred in honor of Saint Peter, for the purchase of oil,
with which all the lamps of that church might be filled at
the vigils of Easter, and likewise at cock-crow ; a hundred
also, in honor of Saint Paul, for the same purpose ; and a
hundred mancuses for the Catholic Pontiff, the successor of the
Apostles.

He being dead, and buried at Winchester, his son Ethel-
bald, during two years and a half after the reign of his father,
governed the West Saxons, and with disgraceful wickedness
took to wife, Judith, the daughter of king Charles, whom his
father had married. At the same period, the most holy Edmund,
who sprang from the race of the ancient Saxons, ascended the
throne of East Anglia.

In the year 860, king Ethelbald departed this life, and was
buried at Sherburne, and his brother Ethelbert succeeding him,
held Kent, Surrey, 63 and Sussex as his kingdom ; in his days a
great army of the pagans came up from the sea, and having
hostilely attacked the city of Winchester, destroyed it. As
they were returning towards the sea, laden with great booty,
Osric, earl of Hampshire, with his men, and earl Ethelwulph,
with the men of Berkshire, stoutly confronted them, and, an
engagement taking place, the pagans fell on every side, the rest
being dispersed in flight.

Ethelbert, also, having governed his kingdom peacefully, and
with the love of all, for five years, died amid the great regrets
of his people, and was buried at Sherburne, near his brother,
in the year 863. In this year also, Saint Swithin, bishop of
Winchester, departed unto the Lord.

In the year 864, the pagans wintered in the isle of Tened, and
made a firm treaty with the men of Kent, who agreed to give
them money for observing their compact. In the meantime,
however, just like foxes, the pagans secretly sallied forth from
their camp by night, and, breaking their covenant, in hopes of
greater gain, ravaged all the eastern coast of Kent.

In the year 866, Ethelred, brother of king Ethelbert, un-
dertook the government of the kingdom of the West Saxons.
In the same year, a great fleet of the pagans came from
Danubia to Britain, and wintered in East Anglia, where that
force in a great measure provided itself with horses.

63 The reading clearly ought to be " Suthrigiam," but the text has it

44 AKNA1S OF BOGEK DE HOVEDEN. A .D. 868.

In the year 867, the above-mentioned army of the pagans
removed from East Anglia to the city of York, and laid waste
the whole country as far as Tynemouth. At this period a
sedition arising among the people of Northumbria, they ex-
pelled Osbert 'their lawful king from the kingdom, and raised
a certain tyrant, Ella by name, who was not of royal birth,
to the supreme power ; but, on the approach of the pagans, this
discord was for the common good in some measure allayed, on
which Osbert and Ella united their forces, and having collected
an army, marched to York. On their approach, the pagans at
once took refuge in the city, and endeavoured to defend them-
selves within the walls. The Christians, perceiving their flight
and dismay, began to pursue them even within the walls of the
city, and to destroy the ramparts ; but when the ramparts were
now levelled, and many of the Christians had entered the city
together with the pagans, the latter, urged by despair and neces-
sity, making a fierce onset upon them, slaughtered and cut
them down, and routed them both within and without the city ;
here the greater part of the Northumbrians fell, the two kings
being among the slain ; on which, the remainder who escaped
made peace with the Danes. Over them the pagans appointed
Egbert king, in subjection to themselves ; and he reigned
over the Northumbrians beyond the Tyne six years. This took
place at York on the eleventh day before the calends of April,
being the sixth day of the week, just before Palm Sunday. In
the same year Elflstan, bishop of Sherburne departed this life,
and was buried at that place.

In the year 868, a comet was distinctly seen. Alfred, the
venerated brother of king Ethelred, asked and obtained in
marriage a noble Mercian lady, daughter of Ethelred, earl
of the Gaini, 64 who was surnamed " Mucil," which means
" the great." Her mother's name, who was of the royal family
of Mercia, was Eadburga ; she was a venerable woman, and
for very many years after the death of her husband, lived a
life of extreme chastity, as a widow, even to the day of her
death.

In the same year, the above-mentioned army of the pagans,
leaving Northumbria, advanced to Nottingham, and wintered

64 This is "Gamorum," in the text, hut it ought to be " Gainorum, of
the Gaini ;" who were the inhabitants of Gainsborough, in Yorkshire.

in that place ; on which Burrhed king of Mercia made a treaty
with them.

In the year 869, the above-mentioned army of the Danes
again advanced to Northumbria, and remained there one
year, ravaging and laying waste, slaughtering and destroying a
very great number of men and women.

In the year 870, many thousands of Danes collected together
under the command of Inguar and Hubba, and coming to East
Anglia, Avintered at Teoford. 65 At this time king Edmund
was ruler over all the realms of East Anglia, a man holy and
just in all things, and in the same year, he, with his people,
fought valiantly and manfully against the above-mentioned
army, but inasmuch as God had predetermined to crown him
with martyrdom, he there met with a glorious death. In the
same year Ceolnoth, archbishop of Canterbury, departed this
life, and was succeeded by Ethelred.

In the year 871, the above-mentioned army of the pagans
entered the kingdom of the West Saxons, and came to Reading,
on the southern banks of the Thames, which is situate in the
district called Bearocscira. 66 There, on the third day after
their arrival, two of their earls, with a great multitude, rode
forth to plunder, while the others, in the meantime, were
throwing up a rampart between the two rivers Thames
and Kennet, on the right hand side of that royal town. 67
Ethelwulph earl of Berkshire with his men, encountered them
at a place which in English is called Englefield, 68 that is to say,
"the field of the Angles," where both sides fought bravely,
until, one of the pagan earls being slain, and the greater part of
their army destroyed, the rest took to flight, and the Christians
gained the victory.

Four days after this, king Ethelred and his brother Alfred,
living collected an army, came to Reading, killing and slaying
even to the very gates of the castle as many of the pagans as
they could find beyond. At length, the pagans sallying
forth from all the gates, engaged them with all their might,
and there both sides fought long and fiercely, till at last the
Christians turned their backs, and the pagans gained the day ;
there too, the above-named earl Ethelwulph was slain.

Four days after this, king Ethelred with his brother Alfred,

again uniting all the strength of their forces, went out to
fight against the above-mentioned army, with all their might
and a hearty good- will, at a place called Eschedun, 69 which
means "the hill of the ash." But the pagans divided them-
selves into two bodies, with equal close columns, and prepared
for battle. For on that occasion they had two kings and
many earls ; the centre of the army they gave to the two kings,
and the other part to all the earls. On seeing this, the Chris-
tians also, dividing their army into two bodies, with no less
alacrity, ranged them front to front ; after which Alfred more
speedily and promptly moved onward to give them battle;
whereas, just then, his brother Ethelred was in his tent at
prayer, hearing mass, and resolutely declared that he would not
move from there before the priest had finished the mass, and
that he would not forsake the service of God for that of men.
This faith on the part of the Christian king greatly prevailed
with God, as we shall show in the sequel.

Now the Christians had determined that king Ethelred, with
his troops, should engage with the two pagan kings ; and that
his brother Alfred, with his men, should take the chance of war
against all the nobles of the pagan army. Matters being thus
arranged, while the king, still at his prayers, was prolonging
the delay, the pagans, fully prepared, advanced rapidly towards
the place of combat ; on which, Alfred, who then held but
a subordinate authority, being unable any longer to cope with
the forces of the enemy, unless he either retreated, or made
the charge before his brother came up, at length, with the
courage of a wild boar, manfully led on the Christian troops
against the army of the enemy, and, relying on the divine aid,
his ranks being drawn up in close order, immediately moved
on his standards against the foe. At last, king Ethelred having
finished his prayers, on which he had been engaged, came up,
and having invoked the great Ruler of the world, immediately
commenced the battle.

But at this point, I must inform those who are not aware of
the fact, that the field of battle was not equally advantageous
to those engaged. For the pagans had previously taken pos-
session of the higher ground, while the Christians drew up
their forces on the lower. There was also on that spot a thorn

Buckinghamshire is meant.



A D. 873. BATTLE AT WALTON. 47

tree, of very stunted growth, around which the hostile ranks
closed in battle, amid the loud shouts of all. After they had
fought for some time boldly and bravely on both sides, tho
pagans, by the Divine judgment, were no longer able to bear
the onset of the Christians, and the greater part of them being
slain, the rest took to a disgraceful flight.

At this place one of the two kings of the pagans, and five
of their earls, were slain, and many thousands of them besides
who fell at that spot, and in various places, scattered over the
whole breadth of the plain of Eschedun. There fell there
king Baiseg, and earl Sydroc the elder, and another earl Sydf oc
the younger, earl Osbern, earl Freana, and earl Harold. The
whole army of the pagans pursued its flight all night, until
next day, when most who had escaped reached the castle.

In four days 70 after these events, Ethelred, with his brother
Alfred, uniting their forces, marched to Basing, again to fight
with the pagans, and after a prolonged combat the pagans at
length gained the victory. Again, after a lapse of two months,
king Ethelred and his brother Alfred, after having long fought
with the pagans, who had divided themselves into two bodies,
conquered them at Meretun, 71 putting them all to flight ; but
these having again rallied, many on both sides were slain, and
the pagans at last gained the day.

The same year, after Easter, king Ethelred departed this life,
after having manfully ruled the kingdom five years amid much
tribulation, on which his brother Alfred succeeded him as king,
in the year from the incarnation of our Lord 872. He was
the most accomplished among the Saxon poets, most watchful
in the service of God, and most discreet in the exercise of
justice. His queen Elswisa bore him two sons, Edward and
Egelward, and three daughters, Egelfleda, queen of the Mercians,
Jkhelgeva, a nun, and Elethritha.

At the completion of one year n from the beginning of his
reign, at a hill called Walton, 73 he fought a most severe battle

with, a handful of men against the pagans ; but, alas ! the
enemy was victorious ; nor indeed is it to be wondered at,
that the Christians had but a small number of men in the
engagement ; for in a single year they had been worn out by
eight battles against the pagans, in which one of their kings
and nine dukes, with innumerable troops, had been slain.

In the year 872, Alchun, bishop of the Wiccii, 74 haying de-
parted this life, Werefrith, the foster-father of the holy church
of Worcester, and a man most learned in the holy scriptures,
was ordained bishop by Ethered archbishop of Canterbury, on
the seventh day before the ides of June, being the day of Pen-
tecost ; he, at the request of king Alfred, translated the books
of the dialogues of the pope Saint Gregory, from the Latin
into the Saxon tongue. At the same period, the Northumbrians
expelled their king, Egbert, and their archbishop Wulpher.
An army of the pagans came to London, and wintered there,
on which the Mercians made a treaty with them.

In the year 873, the said army left London, and first pro-
ceeded to the country of the Northumbrians, and wintered
there in the district which is called Lindesig, 75 at a place called
Torkeseie, 76 on which the Mercians again made a treaty of
peace with them. Egbert the king of Northumbria dying,
his successor was Eeisig, who reigned three years. Wulpher,
also, was this year recalled to his see.

In the year 874, the above-mentioned army left Lindesey,
and, entering Mercia, wintered at a place which is called Reo-
padun. 77 They also expelled Burrhed king of Mercia, from
his kingdom, in the twenty-second year of his reign. Going
to Rome, he died there, and was honorably buried in the church
of Saint Mary, in the school of the Saxons. After his expul-
sion, the Danes reduced the kingdom of the Mercians to
subjection, and committed it to the charge of a certain military
officer of that nation, Ceolwnlph by name, on condition that
whenever they chose, without any subterfuge, they might take
and keep it.

A.D. 877. RAVAGES OF THE DANES. 49

In the year 875, the army of the pagans, leaving Reopadun,
divided into two bodies, one part of which, with Alfdan, pro-
ceeded to the country of the Northumbrians, and reduced the
whole kingdom of Northumbria to subjection. Thereupon
Erdulph, bishop of Lindisfarne, and abbat Edred carried away
the body of Saint Cuthbert from the island of Lindisfarne and
wandered about with it for a period of seven years. The other
division of the army with Guder, 79 Osbitel, and Amund, their
three kings, wintered at Grantebrige. 80

King Alfred, in a naval engagement with six ships of the
pagans, captured one, and the res.t escaped by flight.

In the year 876, the pagan king Halden divided Nor-
thumbria between himself and his followers. Reisig, king of
the Northumbrians, died, and was succeeded by Egbert the
Second. Hollo, the pagan, a Dane by birth, with his followers
this year entered Normandy, on the fifteenth day before the
calends of December ; he was the first duke of the Normans, and
on being baptized thirty years afterwards, was named Robert.

The above-mentioned army sallying forth by night from
Grantebrige, entered a fortified place which is called Werham. 81
On learning their sudden arrival, the king of the Saxons made
a treaty with them, on condition that having first given hos-
tages, 82 they should depart from the kingdom. However, after
their usual custom, caring nothing for hostages or oaths, they
broke the treaty, and one night took the road to Examcester, 83
which in the British language is called Caer-wisc. 84

In the year 877, the above-mentioned army left Examcester,
and marching to Cyppanham, 85 a royal town, passed the winter
there. King Alfred in these days endured great tribulations,
and lived a life of disquietude. In the same year also, Inguar
and Haldene came from the country of the Demetse, 86 in
mhich they had wintered, like ravening wolves, after having
slaughtered multitudes of Christians there and burned the mo-
nasteries, and sailing to Devonshire, were slain there by the

most valiant thanes of king Alfred, together with twelve hun-
dred men, at Cernwich, 8 ' in which place the said king's thanes
had shut themselves up for safety.

King Alfred being encouraged in a vision by Saint Cuthbert,
fought against the Danes, at the time and place where the
saint had commanded him ; and having gained the victory, from
that time forward was always invincible and a terror to the foe.
For the king, putting his trust in the Lord, came with an im-
mense army to the place which is called Edderandun, 88 near
which he found the forces of the enemy prepared for battle.
On this, a severe battle being fought, which lasted the greater
part of the day, the pagans were conquered and put to flight; the
rest being hemmed in by the king's army, fearing the rigours
of famine and cold, and dreading the severity of the king, with
tears and entreaties, sued for peace, and offered hostages toge-
ther with oaths. In addition to this, their king, whose name
was Guthrum, declared that he wished to become a Christian ;
on which, king Alfred having granted all these requests,
tHe above-named king of the pagans, together with thirty
chosen men of his army, met him at a place which is called
Aalr, 89 and king Alfred, receiving him as his son by adoption,
raised him from the holy font of baptism, and named him Ethel-
stan, and enriched him and all his companions who had been
baptized with him, with many presents. He remained with
the king twelve days, receiving during that time most honorable
entertainment, and" the king bestowed on him East Anglia,
over which Saint Edmund had reigned.

In the year 878, the above-mentioned army of pagans left
Scippanham 90 as they had promised, and coming to Cirencester
remained there one year. In the same year also, an immense
army of the pagans came from the parts beyond the sea to
the river Thames, and joined the forces before-mentioned. In
the same year, an eclipse of the sun took place, between the
ninth hour 91 and vespers.

proceeded to East Anglia, and parcelling out that country, began
to take up their abode there. The pagans, who had passed
the winter in the island of Hame, 92 began to visit France, 93
and for one year took their quarters at Ghent.

In the year 880, the above-mentioned army of the pagans,
having provided themselves with horses, came into the terri-
tories of the Franks, on which the Franks engaged them in
battle, and came off victorious. The pagans, having now ob-
tained horses, made incursions on every side. In these days,
numerous monasteries in that kingdom were demolished and
destroyed. In consequence of this, the brethren of the mo-
nastery of the abbat Saint Benedict, disinterred his remains
from the tomb where they had been deposited, and taking them
with them, wandered to and fro.

In the year 881, the above-mentioned army, having towed
their ships up the river Meuse, into the interior of France,
wintered there one year. In the same year, king Alfred, en-
gaging in a naval fight with the ships of the pagans, overcame
them, and took two, after having slain all that were in them.
After this, he inflicted numerous wounds upon the commanders
of two ships, till at last, laying down their arms, with prayers
and entreaties they surrendered to him.

In the year 882, the army of the pagans so often mentioned,
took possession of Cundoth, 94 and quartered there one year.
: The army, which, under the command of Alfdene, the king of
the pagans, had invaded Northumbria, had for some time been
without a leader, in consequence, as I have already mentioned,
of the slaughter of Alfdene and Inguar by the thanes of king
Alfred : but now, having subdued the inhabitants of the
country, they took possession of it, and began to take up their
abode theie, and to inhabit the districts of Jforthumbria that
thty had before laid waste.

Upon this, Saint Cuthbert, appearing in a vision to abbat
Edred, commanded him to tell the bishop and all the army of
the English and the Danes, that, paying the price of his redemp-
tion, they must redeem Cuthred, the son of Hardicanute, whom

the Danes had sold as a slave to a certain widow at Winting-
ham, 94 and when redeemed must make him their king. This
was accordingly done, in the tlurtaenth year of the reign of
king Alfred. Cuthred being thus raised to the throne, the
episcopal see, which was previously in the island of Lindisfarne,
was established at Cestre, 96 anciently called Cuneceastre, seven
years after its removal from the island of Lindisfarne. At
this time also, the law of peace which Saint Cuthbert had also
enjoined by means of the above-named abbat, (namely, that
whoever should flee to his body, should enjoy peace without
molestation from any one, for thirty-seven days, 97 ) both king
Cuthred and king Alfred enjoined as a law of perpetual obser-
vance. In addition to this, the above-named two kings, with
the consent of all, had previously given, in augmentation of
the former episcopal see, the whole territory between the Tyne
and the Tees to Saint Cuthbert, for a perpetual possession : for
long before this period, the bishopric of the church of Ha-
gustald 98 had ceased to exist. And whatever person, with what
intent soever, should attempt to infringe these provisions, him
with everlasting curses they condemned to the punishments of
hell.

There belonged to the bishopric of Lindisfarne, from early
times, Luguballia," or Luel, and Northam ;' all the churches
also, that lay between the river Tweed and the south Tyne, and
beyond the uninhabited land, as far as the western side, at
this period belonged to the above-named church. These
houses also belonged to the see, Carnhum and Culterham, and
the two Gedewerdes, 2 on the southern bank of the river Tyne,
which bishop Egred built ; Meilros 3 also, and Tigbre, and
Tinigham and Colingham, and Brigham, and Tillemuthe, and
Northam, above-mentioned, which was anciently called Ub-
banford. Mercwrede was also in the possession of this
church, having been given with all its appurtenances by king
Ceolwulph.

For this house the king, on renouncing the world, transferred

together with himself to the church of Lindisfarne, of which,
he became a monk, and fought for a heavenly kingdom. His body
being afterwards brought into the church of the above-named
town of Northam, became famous there, according to the report
of the inhabitants of the place, for performing many miracles.
It was through the agency of this king, after he had become a
monk, that licence was granted to the monks of the church of
Lindisfarne to drink wine or ale ; for before that, they were
accustomed to drink nothing but milk and water, according to
the ancient tradition of Saint Aidan, the first bishop of that
church, and of the monks, who, accompanying him from Scot-
land, had there, by the liberality of king Oswald, received a re-
fuge, and with great severity of discipline, rejoiced to serve God.

Besides this, the above-named hishop Egred built a church
at a place which is called Geinforde, and presented it to Saint
Cuthbert ; he also built Bellingham in Heorternesse, and two
other towns, Becclif and "Wigeclif, on the southern bank of the
river Tees, which he gave to Saint Cuthbert, for the maintenance
and support of his servants ; and in like manner, "Wodecester,
and "Wliittingham, and Edulfingham, and Ecwlingham, 5 being
presented by king Ceolwulph, from an early period belonged to
Saint Cuthbert.

In the year 883, pope Marinus, in his love for, and at the
earnest entreaty of, king Alfred, obligingly made the school of
the Saxons at Rome free from all tax and tribute ; he also
sent many gifts to that king, among which he gave him a large
piece of the holy cross, upon which the Son of God was cruci-
fied for the salvation of mankind.

At this time the above-mentioned army of the pagans went
up the river Sunne* to Amiens, and quartered themselves there
one year.

In the time of king Alfred, there came into England one
John, a Scot by birth, a man of shrewd intellect and of great
eloquence. Having a long time previously left his country, he
came to France to the court of Charles the Bald, by whom he
was entertained with great respect, and was honored by him
with his particular intimacy. He shared with the king both
his serious and his more merry moments, and was the sole
companion both of his table and his retirement. He was also
a man of great facetiousness and of ready wit, of which

* Probably Eglingham, in Northumberland. * Somme.



54 ANNALS OF KOGEB DE B.OVEDEN. A.D. 883.

there are instances quoted even to this day ; as the fol-
lowing, for instance. He was sitting at table opposite the
king, who was on the other side of it, and the cups having
gone round and the courses ended, Charles becoming more merry
than usual, after some other things, on observing John do some-
thing offensive to the French notions of good breeding, he
pleasantly rebuked him, and said, " What is there between a
sot and a Scot?" On which he turned back this hard hit on
its author, and made answer, " A table only." What could be
be more facetious than this reply ? The king had asked him
with reference to the different notions of manners, whereas
John made answer with reference to the distance of space.
Nor indeed was the king offended ; for, being captivated by this
prodigy of science, he was unwilling to manifest displeasure by
even a word against the master, for by that name he usually
called him.

At another time, when the servant had presented a dish to
the king at table, which contained two very large fishes, besides
one somewhat smaller, he gave it to the master, that he might
share it with two clerks who were sitting near him. They
were persons of gigantic stature, while he himself was small in
person. On this, ever devising something merry, in order to
cause amusement to those at table, he kept the two large ones for
himself, and divided the smaller one between the two clerks.
On the king finding fault with the unfairness of the division,
" Nay," said he, "I have acted right and fairly. For here is
a small one," alluding to himself, " and here are two great
ones," touching the fishes ; then, turning to the clerks, " here
are two great ones," said he, pointing at the clerks, "and hei'e
is a small one," touching the fish.

At the request, also, of Charles, he translated the " Hierar-
chia," of Dionysius the Areiopagite, from Greek into Latin,
word for word ; the consequence of which is, that the Latin
version can be hardly understood from having been rendered
rather according to the Greek order of the words than according
to our own idiom. He also composed a treatise, which he en-
titled <xt?t tpusiuv /Mpiffpov,'' that is to say, " On the Divisions
of Nature ; " very useful for solving the perplexity as to some
questions, making some allowance, however, for him on cer-

" Roger of Wendover says that the title was iripi Qvanc
meaning much the same thing.



AD. 884. ALFRED DEFEATS THE DAXES. 55

tain points. In some respects he has certainly deviated from the
track of the Latins by keeping his eyes intently fixed upon the
Greeks ; for which reason he has been even considered a here-
tic, and a certain Florus wrote against him. And, indeed,
there are in his book, nip! <pveiuv, very many things which,
unless they are most carefully examined, seem opposed to the
Catholic faith. Pope Nicholas is known to have been of this
opinion ; for he says, in an epistle to Charles, " It has been
reported to our Apostleship, that a certain man, named John,
by birth a Scot, has lately translated into Latin the work of
Saint Dionysius the Areiopagite, which he eloquently wrote in
Greek, touching the divine names and the celestial orders.
Now, according to the usual custom, this ought to have been
sent to us and submitted to the approval of our judgment ;
and the more especially as the said John, though he is stated to
be a man of great knowledge, has been said for some time past
by general report not to be quite sound on certain points."

In consequence of this discredit he became tired of France,
and came to king Alfred, by whose munificence he was appointed
a teacher, and settled at Malmesbury, as appears from the king's
writings. Here, some years afterwards, he was stabbed with
their writing instruments 8 by the boys whom he was teaching,
and quitted this life in great and cruel torments ; at a period
when, his weakness waxing stronger and his hands shaking, he
had often asked in vain that he might experience the bitter-
ness of death. He lay for some time with an ignoble burial in
the church of Saint Laurence, the scene of his shocking death ;
but, after the Divine favour for many nights had honored him
by a ray of fire, the monks, being thus admonished, transferred
him to the greater church, and placed him at the left side of
the altar.

. In the year 884, the above-mentioned army of the pagans
divided themselves into two bodies ; one of which entered East
France, the other returned into Kent, and lay siege to the city of
Eouecestre; 9 but the citizens made a stout resistance, and
king Alfred coming to their aid with his army, compelled the
heathens to raise the siege and return to their ships, leaving
the fortress which they had built there before the gates of the
above named city, besides their spoil, and the men and horses

which they had brought with them from France. In this
year also a fleet was sent by king Alfred for the defence of the
places around East Anglia. When they had come to the mouth
of the river Stour, 9 * they found there sixteen ships of the
pirates, which they took, slaying all on board of them. Those
of the Danes, however, who were able to escape, collected their
ships in various bodies in every quarter, and then engaging
with the English in a naval battle, while, with inert supine-
ness, they "were asleep, a multitude of them unarmed were
slain, and the Danes came off victorious.

At this period, Carloman, king of the Western Franks, that
is to say, of the Alemanni, was killed in hunting, having been
attacked by a wild boar when unattended, which mangled him
with its tusk. His brother Louis had died the year before,
who was also king of the Franks ; for they were both sons of
Louis, the king of the Franks, who had died in the year above-
mentioned in which 10 the eclipse of the sun took place. He
also was the son of Charles, king of the Franks, whose daughter,
Jutthitta, 11 Ethel wulph, king of the West-Saxons, had taken
for his queen.

In this year a great army of the pagans came in ships
from Germany into the country of the ancient Saxons. The
Saxons and the Frisians having united their forces against them,
fought with them twice in one year, and were victorious. In
the same year also, Charles, king of the Alemanni, with the
voluntary consent of all, received the kingdom of the West
Franks and all the territories which lie between the Tyrrhenian
sea and the inlet of the ocean which divides the ancient Saxons
and the Gauls. This Charles was the son of king Louis,
who was brother of Charles, king of the Franks, and father of
the above-named Judith ; these two brothers were sons of
Louis, the son of Charles the Great, that ancient and most wise
sovereign, who was the son of king Pepin.

In the year 885, the above-mentioned army, which had first
entered the kingdom of the East Franks, again returned to
the West Franks, and sailed up the river Seine to Paris ; but
after having besieged the city for a year, the inhabitants
making a stout defence, they were unable to effect an entrance
within the walls.

A.D. 887. KTN T G ALFRED FOUNDS TWO MONASTEBIES. 57

King Alfred, after the burning of cities and the slaughter
of the inhabitants, rebuilt London with great honor, and made
it habitable, and gave it into the charge of Ethered, earl of
Mercia. To this king all the Angles and Saxons, who before
had been dispersed in all quarters, or were with the pagans 1 *
but not in captivity, came, and voluntarily submitted to his
sway. At this period, Plegmund was archbishop of Canter-
bury.

In the year 886, the above-mentioned army left Paris, being '
unable to gain their object, and steered their fleet thence along
the Seine, as far as a place called Chezy. There having taken
up their quarters for a year, in the year following they entered
the mouth of the river lona, 13 and, making great ravages to
the country, remained there a year.

In the same year, Charles, king of the Franks, departed this
life, in the sixth week after his expulsion from his kingdom
by Ernulph, his brother's son. After his death the kingdom
was divided into five parts, but the principal part devolved
on Ernulph, to whom the other four, of their own accord, took
the oath of fealty ; inasmuch as not one of them could be le-
gitimate heir on his father's side, except Ernulph alone : with
him, therefore, remained the supreme power.

This, then, was the division of the kingdom : Ernulph re-
ceived the countries on the eastern side of the river Rhine ;
Ehodulph the inland parts of the kingdom ; Odo the west ; and
Beorgar and Wido 14 Lombardy and all the lands on that side of
the mountains. But these kingdoms, thus divided, afflicted
each other with mighty wars, and the kings expelled one
another out from their dominions.

In this year Ethelhem, u earl of Wiltshire, carried to Rome
the alms of king Alfred.

In the year 887, among the numberless good things that
king Alfred did, he founded two most noble monasteries ; one
for monks, at a place which is called Ethelingege, 16 or the
"the island of nobles," where, collecting monks of various

with the heathens." This is clearly wrong, for they had not the oppor-
tunity of so doing. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle and Roger of Wendover

orders, he first appointed John to be abhat, a priest and monk,
and an ancient Saxon by birth ; the other a noble monastery
also near the east gate of Sceaftesbrig, 17 he erected for the recep-
tion of nuns, and over it he appointed as abbess his own daughter
Ethelgiva, a virgin consecrated to God. These two monas-
teries he enriched with possessions in land, and riches of every
kind.

In the year 888, Ethelfrid. archbishop of Canterbury, departed
' this life, and was succeeded by Plegmund.

In the year 889, king Guthrum, whom, as I have previously
mentioned, king Alfred raised from the font, giving him the
name of Ethelstan, departed this life. He, with his people,
dwelt in East Anglia, and was the first who held and possessed
that province, after the martyrdom of the king Saint Edmund.

In the year 890, "Wulpher, archbishop of York, died, in the
thirty-ninth year of his archiepiscopate.

In the year 892, Hasting, the pagan king, entered the
mouth of the Thames, with eighty piratical ships, and threw
up fortifications at Middletun. 18

In the year 893, Cuthred, king of Northumbria, died. The
pagans of Northumbria ratified the peace with Alfred by
oath.

In the year 894, the pagans brought their ships up the river
Thames, and after that, up the river Lige, 19 and began to throw
up their fortifications near the river, at the distance of twenty
miles from London.

In the year 895, in summer time, a great part of the citizens
of London, and a considerable number from the neighbouring
places, attempted to destroy the fortifications which the pagans
had constructed ; but on their making a stout resistance, the
Christians were put to flight, and four of the thanes of king
Alfred slain.

In the year 896, the army of the pagans in East Anglia
and Northumbria, collecting plunder by stealth on the coast,
grievously laid waste the land of the West Saxons, and espe-
cially by using long and swift ships, which they had built many
years before. To oppose them, by order of king Alfred ships
were constructed, twice as long, sharp, and swift, and not
so high, 20 by the onset of which, the said ships of the

enemy might be overcome. On these being launched, the king
gave orders to take alive, as many as they could, and to slay
those whom they could not take ; the result of which was,
that in the same year, thirty ships of the Danish pirates were
captured, some of whom were slain, and some taken to the
king alive, and hanged on gibbets.

In the year 897, Hollo, the first duke of the Normans, with
his army laid siege to the city of Chartres ; but Walzelm, the
bishop of that city, calling Richard, duke of Burgundy, and
Ebalus, earl of Poitou, to his aid, and carrying the tunic of
Saint Mary in his hands, by the Divine will put duke Eollo to
flight, and delivered the city.

In the year 898, Ethelbald was ordained archbishop of
York.

In the year from the incarnation of our Lord 899, king
Alfred, son of the most pious king Ethelwulph, having-reigned
twenty-nine years and six months, departed this life, in the
fourth year of the indiction, 21 on the fifth day before the
calends of November, and was buried in the new monastery at
Winchester.

He was succeeded by his son Edward, surnamed the Elder,
who was inferior to his father in his acquaintance with litera-
ture, but his equal in dignity and power, andhis superior in glory.
For, as will be shewn in the sequel, he extended the limits
of his kingdom much farther than his father did. He also
built many cities, and restored some that had been destroyed ;
the whole of Essex, East Anglia, Northumbria, and many
districts of Mercia, of which the Danes had been long in pos-
session, he manfully wrested from their hands. After the
death of his sister Ethelfreda, he obtained possession of the
whole of Mercia, and received the submission of all the kings
of the Scots, the Cumbrians, the people of Strath-Clyde, and
the West Britons.

By Egewinna, a most noble lady, he had Ethelstan, his
eldest son : by his wife Edgiva he had three sons, Edwin, Ed-
mund, and Edred, anda daughter named Eadburga, avirgin most

and as one such edict was supposed to appear regularly every fifteen years,
the years were reckoned by their distance from the year cf each indiction.

by ecclesiastical writers in describing epochs.

strictly consecrated to God, with three 22 other daughters ; one
of whom, Otho, the eighty-ninth emperor of the Romans, and
another, Charles, king of the West Franks, took to wife ; whose
father's sister, that is to say, the daughter of the emperor Charles,
Ethelwulph, the king of the "West Saxons, had married ; the
third daughter was married to Sithric, king of Northumbria.

In this year, Erdulf, bishop of Lindisfarne, departed this
life, and was succeeded by Guthred ; Osbert was also expelled
from his kingdom.

In the year 900, the most valiant duke Athulph, brother of
queen Ealwitha, the mother of king Edward, and Virgilius,
the venerable abbat of the Scots, departed this life ; also Grim-
bald, the saint and priest, one of the masters of king Alfred,
attained the joys of the kingdom of heaven.

In the year 902, the people of Kent fought with a great host
of the piratical Danes, at a place which is called Holme, and
came off victorious.

In the year 903, that pious handmaid of Christ, queen
Elswitha, the mother of king Edward, departed this life ; she
founded a monastery for nuns at Winchester.

In the year 904, the armies of the pagans of East Anglia
and Northumbria, finding that king Edward was invincible,
made peace with him, at a place which, in the English lan-
guage, is called Thitingaford. 23

In the year 905, the city, which is called in the British
tongue, Karlegion, 24 and in the Saxon, Legacestre, was rebuilt
by the command of duke Ethered and Ethelfleda.

In the year 906, the bones of Saint Oswald, the king and
martyr, were removed from Bardonig, 26 into Mercia. The
most invincible king Edward, because the Danes had infringed
the treaty which they had made, sent an army of West Saxons
and Mercians into Northumbria, which, having arrived there,
for nearly forty days did not cease to lay it waste, and slay-
ing a vast number of the Danes, compelled their kings and

leaders to renew the treaty of peace with king Edward, which
they had broken.

In the year 907, in the province of Stafford, at a place which
is called Teotenhale, 26 a memorable battle took place between
the English and the Danes ; but the English gained the day.

In the year 908, Ethered, the king's earl of the Mercians, a
man of great virtue, departed this life ; and after his death,
Ms wife Egelfleda, the daughter of king Alfred, for a long time
most ably governed the kingdom of the Mercians, except the
cities of London and Oxford, of which her brother, king Edward,
retained the government.

In the year 909, Egelfleda, the lady of the Mercians, on the
second day before the nones of May, came with an army to the
place which is called Sceargate, 27 and there erected a fortified
castle, and after that, another on the western bank of the river
Severn, at the place which is called Brige. 28

In the year 910, at the beginning of summer, Egelfleda, the
lady of the Mercians, proceeded with the Mercians to Tamu-
irting, 29 and rebuilt that city. In this year king Niel was
slain by his brother Sithric.

In the year 911, Werfred, bishop of the "Wiccii, departed
this life at Worcester ; he was a man of great sanctity and
learning, and, as I have previously mentioned, at the request
of king Alfred, translated the Dialogues of Saint Gregory the
pope into the Saxon tongue ; he was succeeded by Ethelhun.
Egelfleda, the lady of the Mercians, founded the city which is
called Eadesbirig, 30 and at the close of autumn another, which
is called "Warewic. 31

In the year 912, the most invincible king Edward went to
Bedford, before the feast of Saint Martin, and received the sub-
mission of its inhabitants, and having remained there thirty
days, ordered a city to be founded on the south side of the
river Lea. 32

In the year 913, Egelfleda, the lady of the Mercians, sent
an army into the territory of the Britons, 33 to besiege the castle

at Bricenamere ; M having taken the place, they captured the
wife of the king of the Britons, with thirty-four men, and
brought them prisoners into Mercia.

In the year 914, Egelfleda, the lady of the Mercians, on the
day before the calends of August, took Derby by storm, and
gained possession of that province ; four of her thanes, who
were most esteemed by her, were there slain at the city gate,
while bravely fighting.

In the year 915, Egelfleda, the lady of the Mercians, a
woman of remarkable prudence, justice, and virtue, departed
this life, on the nineteenth day before the calends of July, in
the eighth year after she by herself had governed the king-
dom of the Mercians with a vigorous rule, and left her only
daughter Elfwinna, whom she had by Ethered, the king's
earl, heiress to her kingdom. Her body was conveyed to
Gloucester, and honorably buried in the church of Saint Peter.

In the year 916, king Edward sent into Northumbria an
army of Mercians, to liberate the city of Mamcestre, 35 and post
there some brave soldiers as a garrison. After this, he en-
tirely deprived his niece Elfwinna of her authority in the
kingdom of Mercia, and ordered her to be taken into Wessex.
King Sithric also took Devonport by storm.

In the year 917, the king of the Scots, with the whole of
his nation, Reginald, king of the Danes, with the Danes and
English who inhabited Northumbria, and the king of the
Strath-Clyde Britons, 36 with his people, chose Edward the
Elder as their father and liege lord, and made a lasting treaty
with him.

In the year 918, the Clito Ethelward, brother of king Ed-
ward, departed this life, on the seventeenth day before the calends
of November, and was buried at Winchester ; Ethelstan, the
bishop of the Wiccii, 37 also died, and was succeeded by Wilfred.

In the year from the incarnation of our Lord 919, 38 Edward
the Elder, the most invincible king of the English, departed
this life, at the royal town which is called Fearndun, 39 in the
thirty-fourth 40 year of his reign, and the fifteenth of the indic-

tion, after having greatly distinguished himself while king. He
reigned most gloriously over all the nations that inhabited
Britain, both those of the Angles, the Scots, the Cumbrians,
the Danes, and the Britons. 41 After his death, he left the helm
of state to his son Ethelstan, and his body having been carried to
"Winchester, was buried with regal pomp at the new monastery
there.

Ethelstan was crowned at Kingestun, 42 which means " the
royal town," and was consecrated with due honor by Athelin,
archbishop of Canterbury. In his time, the illustrious child
Dunstan was born in the kingdom of Wessex.

In the year 920, Ethelstan, the illustrious and glorious king
of the English, with great pomp and state, gave his sister in
marriage to king Sithric, who was of Danish origin.

In the year 921, king Sithric departed this life, and king
Ethelstan having expelled his son Cuthred, who had succeeded
his father, added his kingdom to his own dominions. All the
kings beside, of the whole of Albion, namely, Huwald, 43 king
of the West Britons, 44 Constantine, king of the Scots, and
Wuer, 45 king of the Wenti, he conquered in battle and utterly
routed. All of these, seeing that they could not resist his
valour, met him on the fourth day before the ides of July, at
a place which is called Eamot, and having made the oaths,
made a lasting treaty with him.

In the year 922, Wilfred, bishop of the Wiccii, died, and
was succeeded by Kinewold.

In the year 923, Erithestan, bishop of Winchester, a man of
remarkable sanctity, resigned the bishopric of Winchester,
Brinstan, a religious man, being ordained bishop in his stead,
and in the following year departed to the Lord.

In the year 924, king Ethelstan ordered his brother Edwin
to be drowned in the sea.

In the year 925, Ethelstan, the valiant and glorious king of
the English, Constantine, king of the Scots, having broken
the treaty which he had made with him, marched with a large
army into Scotland, and coming to the tomb of Saint Cuthbert,
commended himself and his expedition to his guardianship,
and presented to him many and various gifts, such as befitted a

king, and lands as well ; consigning to everlasting flames those
who should take away any portion therefrom. After this, with
a very large force he subdued the enemy, and with his army
laid waste Scotland, even as far as Feeder and Wertermore,
while with his fleet he ravaged as far as Catencs ;" in conse-
quence of this, king Constantine, being compelled so to do, gave
up his son to him as a hostage, together with suitable presents ;
and the peace being thus renewed, the king returned to Wessex.
In the same year Saint Bristan departed this life.

In the year 925, the religious monk Elphege, surnamed the
Bald, a kinsman of Saint Dunstan, received the bishopric of
Winchester.

In the year 927, Anlaf, the pagan king of Ireland and of
many of the islands, being encouraged by his father-in-law,
Constantine, king of the Scots, entered the mouth of the
Humber with a vast fleet, amounting to six hundred and fifteen
sail ; on which he was met by king Ethelstan and his brother
the Clito Edmund, with an army, at the place which is called
Brumanburgh. 47 The battle lasted from the beginning of the
day to the evening, and they slew five minor kings and seven
dukes, whom the enemy had invited to their aid, and shed
such a quantity of blood, as in no battle before that had ever
been shed in England ; and, having compelled the kings Anlaf
and Constantine, and the king of the Cumbrians, to fly to their
ships, they returned in great triumph. But the enemy having
experienced extreme disaster in the loss of their army, returned
home with only a few men.

In the year from the incarnation of our Lord 940, Ethel-
stan, the valiant and glorious king of the English, departed
this life at Gloucester, in the sixteenth year of his reign, and
in the fourteenth of the indiction, on the sixth day before the
calends of November, being the fourth day of the week ; his
body was carried to the city of Maidulph, 47 * and was there
honorably interred. His brother Edmund succeeded him in
the eighteenth year of his age.

In the year 941, the Northumbrians proving regardless
of the fealty which they owed to Edmund, the mighty
king of the English, chose Anlaf, king of the Norwegians

as their king. The elder Richard became duke of the Nor-
mans, and continued so for fifty-two years.

In the first year of the reign of king Edmund, king Anlaf
first came to York, and then marching to the south, laid siege
to Hamtune ; 44 but not succeeding there, he turned the steps of
his army towards Tameworde, 45 and having laid waste all the
places in the neighbourhood, while he was returning to Lega-
cestre, 46 king Edmund met him with an army ; but he had
not a severe struggle for the mastery, 47 since the two arch-
bishops Odo and "Wulstan, having allayed the anger of both of
the kings, put an end to the fight. And thus peace being made,
the "Watlingastrete 48 was made the boundary of both kingdoms ;
Edmund having the sway on the southern side, and Anlaf on
the northern. Anlaf having pillaged the church of Saint
Balther and burnt Tinningham, shortly after perished. After
this, the people of York laid waste the island of Lindisfarne,
and slew great numbers. The son of Sithric, whose name was
Anlaf, then reigned over the Northumbrians.

In the year 942, Edmund, the mighty king of the English,
entirely wrested five cities, namely, Lincoln, Nottingham,
Derby, Leicester, and Stamford from the hands of the Danes,
and reduced the whole of Mercia under his own power. He was
a friend 49 of Dunstan, the servant of God, and by following his
counsels became renowned. Being loaded by him with various
honors the latter was appointed to the abbacy of Glastonbury, in
place he had been educated.

In the year 943, when his queen, Saint Elgiva, had borne
to Edmund, the mighty king, a son named Edgar, Saint Dun-
stan heard voices, as though on high, singing and repeating,
" Peace to the church of England in the times of the child that
is now born, and of our Dunstan." In this year, the same
^ing raised king Anlaf, of whom we have previously made men-
tion, from the font of holy regeneration, and gave him royal
presents, and shortly afterwards held Reginald, king of the

Northumbrians when he was confirmed by the bishop, and
adopted him as his own son.

In the year 944, Edmund, the mighty king of the English,
expelled two kings, namely, Anlaf, son of king Sithric, and
Reginald, son of Guthferth, from Northumbria, and reduced it
to subjection.

In the year 945, Edmund, the mighty king of the Englisfi,
laid waste the lands of the Cumbrians, and granted them to
Malcolm, king of the Scots, on condition that he should be
faithful to him both by land and sea.

In the year from the incarnation of our Lord 946, Edmund,
the mighty king of the English on the day of the feast of
Saint Augustine, the instructor of the English, while, at a
town, which in English is called Pucklecirce, 50 he was attempt-
ing to rescue his sewer Leo 51 from the hands of a most vile
robber, for fear lest he should be killed, was slain by the
same man, after having reigned five years and seven months,
in the fourth year of the indiction, on the seventh day before
the calends of June, being the third day of the week. Being
taken to Glastonbury, he was there interred by Saint Dunstan,
the abbat.

His brother Edred succeeded him in the kingdom, and was
consecrated king by Saint Odo, the archbishop, at Kingston.

In the year 947, "Wulstan, archbishop of York, and all
the nobles of Northumbria, swore fidelity to Edred, the excel-
lent king of the English, at a town which is called Tadenes-
clif, 62 but they did not long observe it ; for they elected a cer-
tain man, named Eiric, a Dane by birth, to be king over them.

In the year 948, in return for the unfaithfulness of the
Northumbrians, Edred, the excellent king of the English, laid
waste the whole of Northumbria; in which devastation the
monastery at Rhipum, 53 which was said to have been formerly
built by Saint Wilfred, the bishop, was destroyed by fire. But,
as the king was returning homewards, the army sallied forth
from York, and made great slaughter of the rear of the king's

50 Pucklechurch, in Gloucestershire. Matthew of Westminster and
Roger of Wendover call the place Micklesbury.

81 It is more generally represented that the name of the robber was Leof ;
the name no doubt which is here given to the attendant.

army, at a place which is called Chesterford. The king
being greatly enraged thereat, wished to return at once and
entirely to depopulate the whole of that region ; but, on un-
derstanding this, the Northumbrians, being struck with terror,
forsook Eiric, whom they had appointed king over them, and
made compensation to the king for his injuries with honors,
and for his losses with presents, and mitigated his anger with
no small sum of money.

In the year 951, Saint Elphege, surnamed the Bald, bishop
of Winchester, who had graced Saint Dunstan with the monas-
tic garb and the degree of priest, ended this life, and was
succeeded in the see by Efsin. In this year also died Oswel, 55
the king of the Britons.

In the year 952, Edred, the renowned king of the English,
placed Wulstan, archbishop of York, in close confinement at
Withanbrig, 56 because he had been often accused before him
on certain charges.

In the year 953, Wulstan, the archbishop of York, having
been released from custody, the episcopal dignity was restored
to him at Dorchester.

The kings of the Northumbrians having now, as I have
mentioned above, come to a close, it is my intention here to
insert how and to what earls that province afterwards became
subject.

The last of the kings of that provinpe, as I have said a
little above, was Eiric, whom the Northumbrians, on violating
their plighted faith, which they had sworn to king Edred,
made king ; for which reason the king, in his anger, ordered
the whole province to be utterly laid waste. On this,
the Northumbrians having expelled their king and slain
^A.mancus, the son of Anlaf, and with oaths and presents
appeased king Edred, the province was given in charge to
earl Osulph; who afterwards, in the reign of king Edgar,
took Oslac as his associate in the government. After this,
Osulph took charge of the parts on the northern side of
Tyne, while Oslac ruled over York and its vicinity. He was
succeeded by Waltef the Elder, who had, as his successor, his
son, Ucthred. When, in the reign of king Edric, king Canute

66 The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle says Jedburgh.



68 ANNALS OF BOGEB DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 953.

invaded Korthumbria with a hostile force, being compelled by
necessity, he went over with his followers to Canute ; and
after having taken the oath of fealty and given hostages, he was
slain by a certain very wealthy Dane, Thurebrand, surnamed
Holde, Canute giving his sanction thereto ; and in his place
his brother, Eadulph Cudel, was substituted. Earl Ucthred
left three sons surviving him, Aldred, Eadulph, and Cospatric.
The first two of these were successively earls of Northumbria ;
the third, who did not enjoy the honor of the earldom, had a
son named Ucthred, whose son was Eadulph, surnamed Rus,
who, in after times, was the leader of those who murdered
bishop Walcher ; indeed, he himself is said to have slain him
with his own hand. However, shortly afterwards, he himself
was slain 'by a woman, and was buried in the church of Gede-
worde ; but afterwards such a mass of filth as his body was
cast out from there by Turgot, formerly prior of the church of
Durham, and archdeacon.

After Eadulph Cudel, Aldred, the son of the above-named
earl Ucthred, received the earldom, and slew the murderer,
Thurebrand, in revenge for the death of his father. On this,
Carl, the son of Thurebrand, and the said earl Aldred, after
plotting against the lives of each other, were at last reconciled.
But shortly after, Aldred, suspecting no evil, was slain by
Carl, in a wood which is called Eisewode, the brother of
Aldred having joined in the plot. After the death of his
brother, Eadulph became earl of Northumbria; who, being
elated with pride, laid waste the country of the Britons that
is to say, of the Welsh in a most cruel manner. But, in the
third year after, when, a treaty having been made, he had come
to Hardicanute to be reconciled, he was slain by Siward ; who,
in succession to him, had the earldom of the whole of that pro-
vince of Northumbria : that is to say, from the Humber to the
Tweed. On his death he was succeeded by Tosti ; who, having
been banished from England for the great injuries which he had
done to Northumbria, his earldom was given in charge by king
Edward to Morcar ; and, afterwards, by king William. Morcar,
finding his attention distracted by weighty matters in other
quarters, entrusted the earldom beyond the Tyne to Osulph, a
young man, son of the above-named earl Eadulph. Morcar being
afterwards taken prisoner and placed in confinement, king Wil-
liam gave the earldom of Osulph to Copsi, who was the uncle of

earl Tosti, a man of wisdom and prudence. He, having made
a vow to Saint Cuthbert, gave to his servants in his church,
namely, that of Durham, these lands : In Merscum, ten car-
rucates and a half of land, and the church of Saint Germanus
in the same town ; in Thortuna, two carrucates ; and in Thes-
trota, ten bovates of land ; in Eeadeclive half a carrucate, and
in Gisburgh one carrucate of land.

On being deprived of the earldom by Copsi, Osulph, after
hiding himself in hunger and destitution in the woods and
mountains, at length collected a band of his companions, whom
the same necessity had brought together, and surrounded
Copsi at Niwebrin ; " who, escaping among the confusion that
ensued, concealed himself in the church. Being however
betrayed, the enemy set fire to the church : whereon he was
compelled to make his way to the door, where he was slain by
the hand of Osulph, in the fifth week after he had received
the earldom, on the fourth day before the ides of March. In
the ensuing autumn, Osulph himself, rushing headlong upon
a spear which a robber presented at him, was pierced thereby,
arid died on the spot.

After his death, Cospatric, the son of Maldred, the son of
Crinan, went to king William, and, for a large sum of money,
made purchase of the earldom of Northumbria ; for, through
his mother's side, the honor of that earldom belonged to him;
his mother being Algitha, the daughter of earl Ucthred, whom
Elgiva, daughter of king Ethelred, bore to him. This Al-
githa her father gave in marriage to Maldred, the son of
Crinan. After this, Cospatric held the earldom until the king
deprived him of it ; making it a charge against him that he
had with his counsel and assistance aided those who had
slain the earl Robert Cumin with his followers, at Durham,
although he really was not present there ; and also alleging
that he had sided with the enemy when the Normans were
slain at York. Flying, therefore, to king Malcolm, he shortly
afterwards set sail for Flanders; and, after sometime, on
his return to Scotland, the above-named king gave him Dun-
bar, in Lothian, 58 with the adjacent lands, that with these
he might maintain himself and his people until more fortunate

times. But not long after this, being reduced to extreme in-
firmity, lie sent for Aldwin and Turgot, the monks, who at
this time were living at Meilros, 59 in poverty and contrite in
spirit for the sake of Christ, and ended his life with a full
confession of his sins, and great lamentations and penitence,
at Ubbanford, which is also called Northam, and was buried
in the porch of the church there. He gave them two fair
dorsals, 60 that, in whatever place they might chance to take
rest, they should set them up there in remembrance of him.
These are still preserved in the church at Durham.

This Cospatric was the father of Dolfin, Walthen, and Cos-
patric. After Cospatric, the earldom of Northumbria was
given to Walthen, the son of earl Siward, who was entitled
to it both on his father's and his mother's side. For he was the
son of earl Siward, by Elfleda, the daughter of Alfred, who
was formerly earl. Some time after, Walthen having been
taken prisoner, the charge of the earldom was entrusted to
bishop Walcher up to the time of his death. After him, the
king conferred that honor on Alfric. He, being unable to
make head against times of difficulty, and having returned to
his own country, the same king made Eobert de Mowbray earl
of Northumbria ; but he being taken prisoner, king William
the younger, and, after him, king Henry, kept Northumbria
in their own hands.

In the year from the incarnation of our Lord 955, Edelred, 61
the excellent king of the English, fell sick, in the tenth year
of his reign, and his life was despaired of; on which, speedily
dispatching a messenger, he sent for the father of his con-
fessions, 62 namely, Saint Dunstan, the abbat. While repairing
with all haste to the palace, and when he had now got half way
thither, a voice was distinctly heard by him from above, say-
ing, " King Edelred now rests in peace;" whereupon, the
horse on which he was sitting, not being able to endure the
force of the angelic voice, without any injury to his rider,
fell dead upon the ground. The king's body was carried to

w Melrose.

Winchester, and received an honorable burial from the abbat
Dunstan, at the old monastery there.

His cousin, the Clito 63 Edwin, 64 succeeded him in the king-
dom ; he was the son of king Edmund, and of Saint Elgiva,
his queen. In the same year he was consecrated king by
archbishop Odo, at Kingston.

In the year 956, Saint Dunstan, the abbat, was banished
on account of his righteousness by Edwin, king of the English,
and passing the seas, took refuge, during the period of his exile,
in the monastery of Bland igny. 64 On the seventh day before
the calends of January, Wulstan, archbishop of York, departed
this life, and was buried at Oundle j 66 he was succeeded by
Oskitel, a venerable man.

In the year 957, Edwy, king of the English, by reason of
his unwise administration of the government, being despised
by them, was forsaken by the people of Mercia and Northum-
bria, and his brother, the Clito Edgar, was chosen king by
them, and the rule of the two kings was so separated that the
river Thames divided their kingdom. Shortly after this,
Edgar, the king of the Mercians, recalled Saint Dunstan, the
abbat, from exile, with great honor and distinction. A short
time after, Coenwald, the bishop of Worcester, departed this
life, a man of great humility, and of the monastic profession.
In his place Saint Dunstan was elected bishop, and was con-
secrated by Odo, archbishop of Canterbury.

In the year 958, Saint Odo, the archbishop of Canterbury,
separated from each other, Edwy, king of the West Saxons,
and Elgiva, either because, as it is said, she was related to
him, or because he loved her instead of his own wife. 67 In the
same year, the said archbishop, a man famed for his talents,
and commendable for his virtues, endued also with a spirit of

among the Anglo-Saxons, but more generally in especial to the eldest
sons. It was probably derived from the Latin " inclytus," " glorious,"
or from its root, the Greek word icXaroc, of the same meaning.

prophecy, was removed from human affairs, and carried by the
hands of angels into Paradise. He was succeeded by Elfsin,
bishop of "Winchester, and in his place Brihtelm was ordained
to the see of Winchester.

In the year 959, Elfsin, archbishop of Canterbury, while
proceeding to Home to obtain his pall, perished, frozen with
ice and snow, upon the Alpine mountains. Edwy also, king
of the "West Saxons, after having reigned four years, departed
this life at Winchester, and was buried in the new monas-
tery there ; on which he was succeeded in the kingdom by
his brother, Edgar, king of Mercia, who was elected king by
the people of all England, and united the kingdom, before
divided, into one. This took place in the sixteenth year of his
age, five hundred and ten years after the arrival of the Angles
in Britain, and in the three hundred and sixty-third year after
Saint Augustine and his companions had come to England.

Brihtelm, bishop of the people of Dorset, 68 was elected to
the primacy of the see of Canterbury, but as he was not suited
for an office of such importance, by command of the king
he left Canterbury, and returned to the church which he
had lately left. Upon this, by the Divine will, and the counsel
of the wise, Saint Dunstan, the bishop of Worcester, was ap-
pointed primate and patriarch of the mother church of the
English ; by whom and other prudent men, Edgar, the king of
the English, being becomingly instructed, he everywhere
checked the wicked, reduced the rebellious under the yoke of
correction, cherished the virtuous and modest, restored and
enriched the churches of God that had been laid waste, and
having removed all corruptions 68 * from the monasteries of the
secular 69 clergy, gathered together multitudes of monks and
nuns for the praise of the mighty Creator, and ordered more
than forty monasteries to be erected for them. All these he
honored as brethren, and cherished as most beloved sons, ad-
monishing by his example the pastors whom he had set over
them, to exhort them to live regularly and without reproach,
to the end that they might please Christ and his saints in all
things.

A.D. 967. HOXXS PLACED IX THE NEW MONASTERY. 73

In the year 960, Saint Dunstan went to the city of Rome,
in the third year of the indiction, and received the pall from
pope John, and then returned to his country in the paths of
peace. In the lapse of a few months after this, he repaired
to the royal threshold, and, knocking at the gate of the palace,
with suggestions for the exercise of the royal piety and with
most humble prayers, he entreated the king that he would pro-
mote to the honor of the bishopric of Worcester the blessed Os-
wald, the cousin of his own predecessor Odo, a monk noted for
his piety, meekness, and humility, and who, by real experience,
he had proved to wax strong in the Divine fear and in the holy
exercise of virtue. King Edgar assented to the requests of
Saint Dunstan, and the blessed Oswald was installed by him-
self in the high priesthood.

In the year 963, on the death of Brihtelm, Saint Ethel-
wald, the venerable abbat, 70 who had been educated by the
blessed Dunstan, received the bishopric of Winchester, and in
the same year, by the king's command, the clergy 71 having
been expelled, filled the old monastery with monks ; for he
had especially persuaded the king, whose chief adviser he was,
to expel the clergy from the monasteries, and to place in them
monks and nuns.

In the year 964, Edgar the Peaceful, king of the English, took
to wife Elfthritha, 72 the daughter of Ordgar, duke of Devonshire,
after the death of her husband, Elfwold, the glorious duke of the
East Angles; by whom he had two sons, Edmund and Egelred;
he had also before this, by Egelfleda 73 the Fair, the daughter
of duke Ordmar, Edward, afterwards king and martyr ; and
by Saint Elfthritha, 74 he had a daughter, Editha, a virgin
most strictly consecrated to God.

In the same year, the same king placed monks in the new
rfbnastery 78 and in that at Middleton, and over the former he
appointed Ethelgar, over the latter, Kineward, abbats.

not a nun at that time, but being a lay virgin, had assumed the veil through
fear of the king, though she was immediately afterwards forced to the royal
bed." Roger of Wendover gives the same account. 75 At Winchester.

placed nuns in the monastery of Rameseie, 76 which his grand-
father, king Edward the Elder, had built, and appointed Saint
Merwinna abbess over them.

In the year 968, bishop Aldred died at St. Cuthbert's, in
Cuneceastre, 77 and was succeeded in the bishopric by Elfsin.

In the year 969, Edgar the Peaceful, king of the English,
commanded Saint Dunstan, archbishop of Canterbury, and the
blessed Oswald, bishop of Worcester, and Saint Ethelwald,
bishop of Winchester, to expel the secular clergy in the larger
monasteries, that were built throughout Mercia, and to place
monks in them. In consequence of this, Saint Oswald, having
gained his wish, expelled from the monastery the clergy of the
church of Worcester, who refused to assume the monastic habit ;
but those who consented to do so, the bishop himself ordained
as monks, and appointed over them as prior, 78 Winsin, a man
of great piety.

In the year 970, one hundred and ten years after his burial,
in the fourteenth year of the indiction, on the ides of July,
being the sixth day of the week, the relics of the holy and
venerable bishop Swithin were removed from the place of their
sepulture by Saint Ethelwald, the venerable bishop, Elstan,
the abbat of Glastonbury, and Ethelgar, the abbat of the new
monastery, 79 and were interred in the church of the apostles
Saint Peter and Saint Paul.

In the year 971, the Clito Edmund, son of king Edgar, died,
and was honorably interred in the monastery of Kameseie.
Shortly after this, Ordgar, duke of Devonshire, the father-in-
law of king Edgar, departed this life, and was buried at Exan-
cestre. 81

In the year 972, Edgar the Peaceful, king of the English,
having completed the church of the new monastery, which
had been begun by his father, king Edmund, caused it to be
dedicated with all honor. Oskitel, the archbishop of York,
having departed this life, his kinsman, Saint Oswald, the bishop
of Worcester, was chosen archbishop in his room.

In the year 973, in the thirtieth year of his age, being the

the English, received the blessing from Saints Dunstan and
Oswald, the archbishops, and from the other bishops of the
whole of England, as the city of Accamann, 82 and was conse-
crated with very great pomp and glory, and anointed king.

In the lapse of a short time after this, sailing round the
north of Britain with a large fleet, he came to the city of the
Legions, 83 where, according to his command, his eight tri-
butary kings met him, namely, Binath, king of the Scots ;
Malcolm, king of the Cumbrians ; Maccus, king of numerous
islands ; and five others Dusnal, Sifreth, Huwald, James, and
Inchil ; M and there they swore that they would be faithful to
him, and would be ready to assist him both by land and by sea.

On a certain day he embarked with them in a vessel, and
they taking their places at the oars, he himself took the helm,
and steered it skilfully according to the course of the river ;
and amid all the multitude of his chieftains and nobles who
attended in similar vessels, he sailed from the palace to the
monastery of Saint John the Baptist, where prayers having been
offered up, he returned in the same state to the palace ; on
entering which, he is reported to have said to his nobles, that
now at last each of his successors would be able to boast that he
was king of the English, after he had enjoyed the display of
such honors, so many kings paying obedience to him. In
this year Saint Oswald received the pall from Stephen, the
hundred and thirty-fourth pope.

In the year 974, there was a great earthquake throughout
the whole of England.

In the year 975, king Edgar the Peaceful, the monarch of
the English land, the flower and grace of the kings his prede-
cessors, departed this life ; not less worthy of remembrance
among the English than Romulus among the Romans, Cyrus
among the Persians, Alexander among the Macedonians, Arsaces
among the Parthians, Charles the Great among the French,
Arthur among the Britons. After having accomplished all
things in a royal manner, he departed this life in the thirty-

of Westmoreland."

second year of his age, the nineteenth of his reign over Mercia
and Northumbria, the sixteenth of his rule over all England, in
the third year of the indiction, and on the eighth day before
the ides of July, it being the fifth day of the week, leaving
his son Edward heir to his kingdom and his virtues. His
body was carried to Glastonbury, and there interred with royal
honors.

He, during his lifetime, had collected together three thou-
sand six hundred ships ; and it was his custom every year,
after the solemnities of Easter were concluded, to collect
twelve hundred of these on the eastern, twelve hundred on
the western, and twelve hundred on the southern coast of the
island, and to row to the western side with the eastern fleet,
and then sending that back, to row to the north with the
western one ; and again sending that back, to row to the east
with the northern one ; and in this manner it had been his
usage every summer to sail around the whole island, manfully
acting thus for the defence of his kingdom against foreigners,
and for the exercise of himself and his people in military
affairs.

But in the winter and spring it was his practice to pass
along the interior of his kingdom throughout all the provinces
of the English, and to see how his legal enactments, and his
decrees and statutes, had been observed by the men in power.
He was also accustomed to use every possible precaution that
the poor might not receive detriment by oppression from the
rich. Thus, in one respect, his object was military strength,
in the other, justice ; and in both he consulted the welfare of
the people and of the realm. By reason of this he was held
in fear by his enemies on every side, while he was endeared
to those who were subjected to him ; at his departure the
whole kingdom was in a state of perturbation, and after a period
of gladness, because the country flourished in peace in his days,
tribulation began to arise in every quarter.

For Elpher, the duke of the Mercians, and many chief men
in the kingdom, blinded by great bribes, expelled the abbats
and monks from the monasteries in which king Edgar the
Peaceful had placed them, and introduced there secular clergy
with their wives; but the madness of this rash man was
resisted by Ethelwin, the duke of East Anglia, a friend of
God, and his brother Elfwold, and earl Brithnoth, who, hold-

ing a synod, declared that they could never allow the monks
to be expelled from the kingdom, inasmuch as it was they
who kept all religion within the realm ; after which, collecting
an army, they defended the monasteries of East Anglia with
the greatest determination.

While this was going on, a dissension about the election of

a king arose among the nobles of the realm, as some favoured

Edward, the son of the deceased king, and others his brother

Egelred. For which reason the archbishops Dunstan and

, Oswald convened the bishops, abbats, and a great number of

*the nobles, and, having elected Edward, as his father had

commanded, consecrated him, and anointed him king. In the

autumn of this year a comet was seen.

In the year 977, a very great synod was held in East
Anglia, at a town which is called Kirding. 85 After this,
while another synod was being held at Calne, a royal town,
the elders of all England, who were there assembled, fell from
an upper chamber, with the exception of Saint Dunstan ; some
: of them were killed, while some with difficulty escaped death.

In the year from the incarnation of our Lord 978, Edward,
king of the Angles, was unrighteously slain by his people, by
the command of his stepmother, Elfritha, at a place which is
called Corvesgate, 86 and was buried without royal pomp at
Werham. 87 His brother, Egelred, 88 succeeded him, a dis-
tinguished prince, of elegant manners, beauteous countenance,
and graceful aspect. He was consecrated king, at Kingestun,
by the holy archbishops Dunstan and Oswald, and ten bishops,
in the sixth year of the indiction, on the eighth day before the
calends of May, being the Lord's day after the festival of Easter.

Saint Dunstan, being filled with the spirit of prophecy, fore-
told to him that in his reign he would suffer much tribulation,
in these words : " Because thou hast aspired to the kingdom
through the death of thy brother, whom thy mother hath
slain, hear, therefore, the word of the Lord ; thus saith the
Lord, ' The sword shall not depart from thy house, but shall
rage against thee all the days of thy life, and shall slay thy
seed, until thy kingdom shall be transferred unto another

kingdom, whose manners and whose language the people
whom thou dost govern knoweth not ; nor shall thy sin be
expiated but by a prolonged vengeance, the sin of thyself, and
the sin of thy mother, and the sin of the men who have shared
in her unrighteous counsels.' " Therefore, after this, a cloud
appeared at midnight throughout all England, at one time of a
bloody, at another of a fiery, appearance, which afterwards
changed to various hues and colours ; it disappeared towards
dawn.

In the year 979, Elpher, duke of the Mercians, came to
Werham 89 with a multitude of people, and ordered the holy body
of Edward, the precious king and martyr, to be taken up
from the tomb, where many miracles had taken place. When
it was stripped, it was found to be whole and entirely free
from all corruption and contagion ; it was then washed and
arrayed in new vestments, and conveyed to Scaftesbirig, 90 and
honorably buried there.

In the year 980, Southampton was ravaged by the Danish
pirates, and almost all of its citizens either killed or carried
away captives. Shortly after this, the same army devastated
the isle of Tenedland. 91 In this year, also, the province of the
city of the Legions 92 was laid waste by the Norwegian pirates.

In the year 981, the monastery of Saint Petroc 93 the con-
fessor, in Cornwall, was ravaged by the pirates, who, the year
before, had laid waste Southampton, and were then com-
mitting frequent ravages in Devonshire, and in Cornwall
near the sea-shore.

In the year 982, three ships touched on the coast of the
province of Dorset, and laid waste Portland. In this year
the city of London was burned with fire.

In the year 983, Alpher, duke of the Mercians, a kinsman
of Edgar, king of the English, departed this life, on which
his son Alfric succeeded to the dukedom

In the year 984, Saint Ethel wold, bishop of Winchester,

In the year 986, by reason of certain dissensions, Egelred,
king of the English, laid siege to the city of Rochester, but
perceiving the difficulty of taking it, departed in anger, and
laid waste the lands 95 of Saint Andrew the Apostle. Alfric,
the duke of the Mercians, son of duke Alfer, was this year
banished from England.

In the year 987 ; there occurred two plagues, unknown to
the English nation in preceding ages, namely, a fever affecting
the people, and a murrain among animals, which, in the En-
glish language, is called " Scitha," being a flux of the bowels;
these greatly ravaged the whole of England, and affected both
men and animals with great devastation, and, consuming the
inner parts of the body, raged in an indescribable manner
throughout all the territories of England.

In the year 988, "Wesedport 96 was ravaged by the Danish
pirates, by whom, also, Goda, earl of Devon, and Stremewold,
a very brave warrior, were slain ; but a considerable number of
the enemy having been killed, the English became masters of
the place. 97

In the first year of the indiction, on the fourteenth day
before the calends of June, it being the Sabbath, Saint Dunstan
the archbishop departed this life, and attained a heavenly
kingdom ; in his stead Ethelgar, bishop of Selsey, 98 received
the archbishopric, and held it one year and three months.

In the year 989, archbishop Aldred 99 died, and was suc-
ceeded by Aldune.

In the year 991, Gippeswic 1 was ravaged by the Danes.
Their leaders were Justin, and Guthmund, the son of Steitan ;
rith them, not long after this, Brithnoth, the brave duke of

ic East Saxons, engaged in battle near Meldun ; 2 but, after a
multitude on both sides had fallen, the duke himself was slain,

pounds, 3 was for the first time paid to the Danes, in order
that they might desist from the continued pillage, conflagra-
tions, and slaughters of the people, of which they were re-
peatedly guilty near the sea- shore, and might observe a
lasting peace with them.

Saint Oswald the archbishop, on the sixth day before the
ides of November, being the third day of the week, conse-
crated the monastery of Eawele, which he and Ethelwin,
the duke of East Anglia, a friend of God, aided and comforted
by the Divine counsel and assistance, had erected.

In the year 992, being the fifth year of the indiction, on the
day before the calends of March, being the second day of the
week, Saint Oswald the archbishop departed this life before
the feet of the poor, where, according to his usual custom, he
was performing the Divine command, 4 in the manner he had
previously predicted, and attained the joys of the kingdom of
lieaven ; he was buried in the church of Saint Mary, at Wor-
cester, which he himself had erected from the very foundation.
He was succeeded by Adulph, the venerable abbat of Medes-
hampstead ; 5 and not long after the death of the blessed father
Oswald, duke Ethelwin, of illustrious memory, the friend
of God, departed this life, and was honorably buried at
Ramesege. 6

In the year 993, the above-mentioned army of the Danes
took Bebbanburgh, 7 and carried off all they could find in it.
After this, they directed their course to the mouth of the river
Humber, and, having burned many towns and slain many per-
sons in Lindesey and Northumbria, took considerable booty.
Against them a great number of the people of the district
collected with all haste ; but when they were about to engage,
the leaders of the army, whose names were Frana, Frithe-
gist, and Godewin, because, on the fathers' side, they were of
Danish origin, betrayed their followers, and were the first to
set the example of flight.

In the year 994, Anlaf, the king of the Norwegians, and
Sweyn, the king of the Danes, arrived at London, on the day
of the nativity of Saint Mary, with ninety-four galleys, and

immediately attempted to force an entrance and burn it : but
by the aid of God and of His Mother, they -were repulsed by
the citizens, with no small loss to their army. Thereupon,
being exasperated with rage and sorrow, on the same day
they betook themselves thence, and first in Essex and in Kent,
and near the sea-shore, and afterwards in Sussex and in the
province of Southampton, they burned houses, laid waste the
fields, and without respect to sex or age destroyed a very great
number of people with fire and sword, and carried off a large
amount of spoil ; at last, having obtained horses for themselves,
furiously raging, they traversed many provinces to and fro, and
spared neither the female sex nor yet the innocent age of in-
fants, but, with the ferocity of wild beasts, consigned all to
death.

Upon this, king Egelred, by the advice of his nobles, sent
ambassadors to them, promising that he would give them tribute
and provisions, on condition that they should entirely put an
end to their cruelty. Assenting to this request of the king,
they returned to their ships, and then the whole of the army
assembled together at Southampton and passed the winter
there. The provisions were provided for them by the whole of
Wessex; and by the whole of England the tribute, which
amounted to sixteen pounds, was paid. In the meantime, by
the command of king Egelred, Elphege, the bishop of Win-
chester, and the noble duke Ethelwald, proceeded to king
Alaf, and, having given hostages, brought him with great
honor to tie royal town of Andeafaran, 8 where the king was
staying.

He was honorably received by the king, who caused him to
be confirmed by the bishop, and, adopting him as his son, pre-
sented him with royal gifts, on which he promised king Egelred
rthat he would no more come with an army to England ; and,
after this, he returned to the ships, and at the approach of
summer returned to his own country, and carefully adhered
to his promise.

Saint Cuthbert from Cestre ' to Dunholm. 10

in England, having sailed round "Wessex, entered the mouth
of the river Severn, and at one time laid waste South Britain ; u
at another, Cornwall ; at another, Wesedport, in Devonshire ;
and, burning a vast number of towns, put multitudes of people
to the sword; and after this, again going round Penwith-
steort 12 up to the mouth of the river Tamar, their ships
having coasted along Devonshire and Cornwall, they disem-
barked from their ships, leaving them behind, and, there being
no one to prevent them, continued their conflagrations and
slaughter as far as Lideford. 13 In addition to this, they
burned the monastery of the primate, Ordulf, which is called
Taustoke, 14 and, laden with great booty, made their way back
to their ships, and wintered at that place.

In the year 998, the above-named army of the pagans, leav-
ing the mouth of the river which is called Frome, repaired
again to Dorsetshire, .and, after their usual manner, be-
took themselves to plundering; and, as often as they took
up their quarters in the Isle of "Wight, 15 levied supplies upon
Sussex and the province of Southampton. Against such
an outburst as this, forces were often gathered together ; but,
as often as the English were about to engage in battle, either
through treachery or some misfortune, they turned their backs
and left the victory in the hands of the enemy.

In the year 999, the army of the pagans so often mentioned,
entering the mouth of the river Thames, passed up the river
Meodewege, 16 as far as Rochester, and for a few days laid strict
siege to it, upon which, the people of Kent, uniting together
to repel them, had a severe engagement with them ; but, after
many had been slain on both sides, the Danes remained masters
of the river. After this, taking horse, the Danes laid waste
almost the whole of the western coast of Kent. On hearing
of this, Egelred, the king of the English, by the advice of his

South Wales.

12 Of this place Lamharde says : " The country that lieth next the
point of Cornwall is to this day called Pen with ; and, therefore, the Saxons

principal men, collected together both a fleet and a land force.
But, in the end, neither the land nor the naval force effected
anything for the public good, beyond harassing the people,
wasting money, and arousing the vengeance of the enemy.

In the year 1000, the above-mentioned fleet of the Danes
invaded Normandy. Egelred, king of the English, laid waste
the lands of the Cumbrians. He gave orders to his fleet, that,
sailing round the north of Britain, it should meet him at a
place named ; but, being prevented by the violence of the
winds, it was unable to do so. However, it laid waste the
island which is called Monege. 17

In the year 1001, the above-mentioned army of the pagans,
returning from Normandy into England, entered the mouth of
the river Exe, and shortly after commenced the siege of the
city of Exanceeter; but, while attempting to destroy the walls,
they were repulsed by the citizens, who manfully defended the
city. Upon this, being greatly incensed, after their usual manner,
they wandered through Devonshire, burning towns, ravaging
the fields, and slaughtering the people ; and, in consequence, the
men of Devonshire and Somerset uniting together, gave them
battle at a place which is called Penhou. 18 But the English,
by reason of the small number of their soldiers, were not
able to cope with the multitude of the Danes, and took to
flight ; whereon, the enemy having made a great slaughter,
gained the day. After this, taking horse, throughout almost
the whole of Devonshire they committed worse excesses than
before, and, having collected much booty, returned to their
ships. After this, they turned their course to the Isle of
"Wight ; and, for a long time, there being no one to resist them,
occupied themselves in plundering as usual, and raged to such a
degree against the people with the sword, and against the
houses with fire, that no fleet would dare to engage with them
at sea, and no army by land. In consequence, the sadness of
the king was far from slight, while the people were afflicted
with incredible sorrow.

In the year 1002, Egelred, king of the English, having
held a council with his chief men, thought proper to make
peace with the Danes, and to give them provisions and tribute
to appease them, in order that they might cease from their

evil-doings. For this purpose duke Leofsy was sent to
them, who, on coming, asked them to receive the supplies and
the tribute ; whereupon they willingly received his embassy,
and acceding to his request, fixed the amount of tribute
that should be paid them for keeping the peace. And, not
long after this, the sum of twenty-four pounds was paid them.

In the meantime, the same duke Leofsy slew Easig, a noble-
man, the king's high steward, for which reason, the king,
being inflamed with anger, banished him from the country.
In the same year king Egelred took to wife Emma, called in
Saxon Elgiva, the daughter of Richard, the first duke of the
Normans. In this, the twenty-fifth year of the reign of king
Egelred, and the fifteenth of the indiction, on the seven-
teenth day before the calends of May, being the fourth day of
the week, Ardulph, archbishop of York, the abbats, priests,
monks, and religious men being there assembled, raised the
bones of Saint Oswald, the archbishop, from the tomb, and
placed them, with due honor, in a shrine which he had pre-
pared ; and not long after this, that is to say, on the day
before the nones of May, he himself died, and was buried in
the church of Saint Mary, at Worcester, being succeeded by
the abbat Wulstan.

In this year, also, king Egelred ordered all the Danes who
lived in England, both great and small, and of either sex, to
be slain, because they had endeavoured to deprive him and
his chief men of kingdom and life, and to reduce the whole of
England under their dominion.

In the year 1003, by reason of the carelessness and treachery
of Hugh, the Norman earl, whom queen Emma had appointed
over Devonshire, Swe.yn, king of the Danes, entered the city
of Exeter by storm and sacked it, destroying the walls from
the eastern as far as the western gate, and filling 19 his ships
with much spoil. After this, while he was laying waste the
province of Wiltshire, a stout army manfully assembled from
the provinces of Southampton and Wiltshire, and went up
with fixed determination to fight against the enemy; but
when the armies were so near that the one could see the other,
Alfric, the above-named earl, who was at the time in com-
mand of the English, forthwith had recourse to his old

19 " Reperiit" is evidently a mistake for " replevit."

devices, 20 and, pretending illness, began to vomit, saying that
a severe fit of illness had come upon him, and that in conse-
quence he was unable to fight with the enemy.

When the army saw his inertness and timidity, in sorrow
they turned away from the enemy without fighting, making
good the ancient adage " When the leader trembles in battle,
all the other soldiers become still more fearful." Sweyn, on
observing the irresoluteness of the English, led his army to
Wilton, and spoiled and burned it ; in like manner, he also
ravaged Salisbury, and then returned to his ships.

In the year 1004, Sweyn, king of the Danes, coming with
his fleet to Norwich, laid it waste and burned it. Upon this,
Ulfketel, duke of East Anglia, a man of great activity, as
Sweyn had come unawares, and he had had no time for col-
lecting an army against him, after taking counsel with the
chief men of East Anglia, made peace with him ; but he,
breaking the treaty the third week after, secretly stole forth
from the ships with his forces, and attacking Theodford, 21
laid it waste, and after staying in it one night, burned it at day-
break. On learning this, duke Ulfketel gave orders to some
men of the province to break up the ships of the enemy; but
they were either afraid to do so, or neglected to obey his
commands. He himself, however, as soon as he possibly
could, having secretly collected an army together, boldly
advanced against the enemy; and, on their return to the
ships with an unequal number of soldiers, he met them, and
had a most severe engagement with them ; and many on both
sides being slain, the most noble men of East Anglia fell, and
the Danes escaped with difficulty. But if the full forces of
the East AngHans had been present, the Danes could have
never regained their ships ; as, indeed, they themselves bore
"witness that they had never experienced in England a more
severe and hard-fought battle than that in which duke Ulfketel
had engaged with them.

In the year 1005, a severe and dreadful famine afflicted
England. For this reason Sweyn, king of the Danes, returned
to Denmark, with the intention of returning before long.

In the year 1006, Alfric, archbishop of Canterbury, departed
this life, and was succeeded by Elphege, bishop of Winchester,
who was succeeded in his bishopric by Kenulph. In the

month, of July an innumerable fleet of Danes arrived in Eng-
land, and entered the port of Sandwich, and ravaging all
places with fire and sword, first in Kent and then in Sussex,
collected a very large quantity of spoil. On this, king
Egelred assembled an army in Mercia and Wessex, and re-
solved to fight manfully with them ; but they would under no
circumstances engage with him openly, but frequently com-
mitted their ravages, now in one place, and now in another,
immediately, after their usual manner, retreating to their
ships ; and in this way, throughout the autumn, they harassed
the army of the English.

At length, on the approach of winter, as they were returning
homeward with enormous booty, they repaired to the Isle of
Wight, and remained there until the Nativity of our Lord f 2
on the approach of which, as the king was at that period
staying in the province of Shrewsbury, they made way through
the province of Southampton to Berkshire, and burned Read-
ing, and Wallingford, and Ceolesy, 23 with a great number of
men. Moving thence, they passed Easterdune* 4 and came to
Cwichelmelow ; 25 returning from there by another road, the
pirates provoked the natives of the place to battle, and at once
engaging with them, put them to flight, and then retreated to
the ships with the booty they had taken.

In the year 1007, by the advice of his chief men, Egelred,
king of the English, sent ambassadors to the Danes, and told
them that he was willing to give them sustenance and tribute,
on condition that they should desist from their ravages, and
keep a lasting peace with him ; to this request they consented,
and from that time, provisions, and a tribute of thirty-six thou-
sand pounds, were given to them from the whole of England.
In this year, also, king Egelred made a certain Edric, whose
surname was Streone, duke of the Mercians ; who, although
he had Edgitha the king's daughter in marriage, was still
frequently found, by his shifting craftiness, to be a perfidious
traitor to his country, and a public enemy, as will appear in
the sequel ; at last, in the reign of king Canute, he received a
worthy reward for his treachery.

In the year 1008, Egelred, king of the English, ordered for

every one hundred and ten hides of land, one galley to be
built, and for every nine, 26 a coat of mail and a helmet to be
provided, and gave directions that ships should be built with
all speed throughout the whole of England. These being pre-
pared, he put on board of them picked soldiers, with provi-
sions, and that they might protect the extremities of his kingdom
from the incursions of the foreigners, collected them at the port
of Sandwich. At this period, Brithric, the brother of the perfi-
dious duke Edric Streone, a slippery, ambitious, and haughty
man, unjustly accused before the king, Wulnoth, 27 a thane of
the South Saxons, who shortly after took to flight to avoid
being seized, and having obtained nine vessels, committed
numerous ravages near the sea-shore.

But when word was brought to the royal fleet, that if any
one wished, he might easily take him ; Brithric, having col-
lected eighty galleys, set out to give him chase ; however, after
he had sailed for some time with a fair wind, on a sudden a most
violent tempest arose, and wrecked and shattered his ships,
and threw them ashore, where they were shortly after burnt
by "Wulnoth. On this being known, the king with his chief-
tains and nobles returned home. But by his orders the fleet
repaired to London, and thus this mighty labour of the people
was wasted.

In the year 1009, the Danish earl Turkill came with his
fleet to England, and afterwards, in the month of August,
another innumerable fleet of the Danes, the chiefs of which
were Hemming and Ailaf, came to the Isle of Tenedland, 28
and without delay united with the aforesaid fleet, after which
both of them entered the harbour of Sandwich, and the men
disembarking, hastily attacked the city of Canterbury, and began
jto storm it; but shortly after, the citizens of Canterbury,
with the people of East Kent, suing for peace, obtained their
request, and gave them, in consideration of a treaty of peace,
three thousand pounds.

Upon this they returned to their ships, and steered their
course to the Isle of Wight, and after that, according to their
usual practice, frequently collected spoil in Sussex and in the

province of Southampton, in the neighbourhood of the sea-shore,
and burned a great number of towns. On this, king Egelred
collected an army throughout all England, and stationed it in
the provinces adjoining the sea, as a protection against their
incursions ; but for all this, the enemy did not cease committing
ravages in all quarters, according to the situation of the places.
But upon one occasion, when they had made a descent for plun-
der at a greater distance than usual from the sea, and were re-
turning laden with spoil, the king, attended by many thousands
of armed men, got before them, prepared, as was all his army,
to conquer or die.

But the perfidious duke Edric Streona, his son-in-law, used
his endeavours in every way, both by treachery and ambiguous
speeches, that they might not engage, but for that time let
the enemy escape. To this he persuaded the king, and pre-
vailed, and, like a traitor to his country, rescued the Danes
from the hands of the English, and allowed them to escape ; on
which, taking a different direction, with great joy they re-
turned to their ships. After the feast of Saint Martin, they
arrived in Kent, and chose their winter quarters on the river
Thames, and collected provisions in Essex and other provinces
that were adjoining either bank of the river. They also fre-
quently attacked the city of London, and endeavoured to take
it, but were repulsed by the citizens, not without some little
loss to themselves.

In the year 1010, the above-mentioned army of the Danes,
in the mouth of January, disembarking from their ships, came
through the forest which is called Cyltern, 29 into Herefordshire,
and after laying it waste ravaged it with flames, and on their re-
turn collected booty on both banks of the river Thames. When
they had been informed that an army was collected against
them at London, and was about to engage with them, a part
of the army passed over to the southern side of the river, at a
place which is called Stane, 30 and having united and enriched
themselves with abundance of spoil, proceeded through Surrey,
and then returned to their ships, which during the season of
Lent, while they were staying in Kent, they refitted.

After Easter, they came to East Anglia, and having disem-
barked near Gipeswic, 31 marched to a place which is called
Rigmere, where they had learned that duke Ulfketel was en-

camped with his army, and fought a severe battle with him on
the third day before the nones of May. But while the battle
was being hotly contested, the East Angles turned their backs,
a certain thane of the king, a man of Danish origin, Turketel,
surnamed Merenheauod, being the first to begin the flight ; but
the men of Cambridgeshire, manfully fighting, made a stout re-
sistance, till at last, being overpowered, they took to flight.

In this battle fell Ethelstan, the king's son-in-law, Oswy, a
noble thane, together with his son, "Wulfric the son of Leofwin,
Edwy, the son of Effuic, and many other noble thanes, and an
innumerable multitude. The Danes being masters of the field
of slaughter, gained possession of East Anglia ; and taking to
horse, did not cease for three months ravaging the whole pro-
vince, collecting booty, burning towns, and slaughtering men
and animals ; after which they laid waste Thetford and
Grantebrige, 32 and burned them ; having accomplished which,
the foot on board ship, and the cavalry on horseback, returned
again to the river Thames. After the lapse of a few days,
they again sallied forth to plunder, and made straight for the
province of Oxfordshire, and first ravaged it, and then the dis-
tricts of Buckinghamshire and Bedfordshire, burning the
towns, and slaughtering the men and cattle, after which they
returned to their ships with vast booty.

After this, about the time of the festival of Saint Andrew
the Apostle, they committed to the flames Northampton and
its vicinity, as far as they pleased, and then crossed the river
Thames and entered Wessex, where, having consigned to the
flames Caning' s-marsh, 33 and the greater part of the province
of Wiltshire, after their usual manner, they returned with great
booty to their ships about the Nativity of our Lord.

In the year 1011, on the northern side of the Thames, the
provinces of East Anglia, Essex, Middlesex, Herefordshire,
Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire, Bedfordshire, Grantebrige-
shire, 34 the middle parts of Huntingdonshire, and the villages
of a great part of Northamptonshire, were ravaged ; and on
the southern side of the river Thames, the provinces of Kent,
Surrey, Sussex, Southampton, Wiltshire, and Berkshire were
laid waste by the above-mentioned army of the Danes, with fire
and sword ; upon which Egelred, king of the English, and the

chief men of his kingdom; sent ambassadors to them to sue for
peace, and request them to cease from their ravages, promising
them provisions and tribute ; on hearing which, not without
treachery and dissimulation, as the event proved, they con-
sented to his offer.

For, although food was provided for them in abundance, and
tribute paid as much as they pleased, still, they did not desist
from making incursions in straggling bodies throughout the
provinces wherever they chose, laying waste towns, spoiling
some wretched people of their property and slaying others.

In the same year, after having ravaged a great part of Eng-
land, an army of the Danes, between the Nativity of Saint Mary
and the feast of Saint Michael, drawing their lines around
it, laid siege to the city of Canterbury. On the twentieth day
of the siege, through the treachery of the archdeacon Elmer,
whom Saint Elphege had before rescued from being condemned
to death, a part of the city was burnt, and, the army effecting
an entrance, the city was taken. Some were slaughtered with
the sword, some destroyed by the flames. Many were also
thrown from the walls, while some were put to death by being
hung up by their secret parts. The women were dragged by
their hair through the streets of the city, and then, being
thrown into the flames, were thus put to death ; infants were torn
from their mother's breasts, and were either caught on the points
of spears, or ground to pieces under the wheels of vehicles.

In the meantime archbishop Elphege was taken, bound in
fetters, kept in confinement, and put to various torments. Ail-
mar, abbat of the monastery of Saint Augustine, was allowed
to depart. Godwin, the bishop of Rochester, was also taken,
and Leoufruna, abbess of the monastery of Saint Mildred,
Elfrige, the king's steward, the monks also and secular clergy,
and an innumerable multitude of either sex. After this,
Christ's Church was sacked and burnt ; a multitude of monks,
and a crowd, consisting not only of men, but even women and
children as well, were decimated, and nine were put to death,
while the tenth was reserved alive : the amount of the de-
cimated thus saved was four monks and eight hundred men.
After the people had been slaughtered and the whole of the
city burnt, archbishop Elphege was dragged forth in fetters,
hurried along with violence, grievously wounded, and after-
wards led away to the fleet and thrust into prison, where he
was tortured for seven months.



A.O. 1012. PEACE WITH THE DANES. 91

In the meantime the wrath of God, waxing fierce against
this murderous race, put an end to two thousand of them by a
tormenting pain in the intestines. The others being attacked
in a similar manner, were appealed to by the faithful, to
make reparation to the archbishop, but refused to do so. In the
meantime, the mortality increased, and at one time would put
an end to ten, at another twenty, and at another a still greater
number at the same instant.

In the year 1012, the perfidious duke Edric Streona, and all
the chief men of England, assembled at London before Easter,
and remained there until the tribute promised to the Danes,
which consisted of forty-eight pounds, 35 was paid. In the mean-
time, on the holy Sabbath of the rest of our Lord, a proposal
was made to archbishop Elphege by the Danes, that if. he wished
to preserve his life and liberty, he should pay three thousand
pounds. Upon his refusal, they deferred his death until the
next Sabbath, on the approach of which they were inflamed
against him with great anger, both because they were intoxi-
cated with excess of wine, and because he had forbidden that
any thing should be given for his liberation. After this, he was
brought forth from prison, and dragged before their council.
On seeing him, they instantly sprang from their seats, struck
him down with the butt ends of their axes, and overwhelmed
him with stones, bones, and the skulls of oxen.

At length, a certain person, whose name was Thrum, and
whom he had confirmed the day before, moved with pity at
this wickedness, 36 struck him on the head with an axe, upon
which he immediately fell asleep in the Lord, on the thir-
teenth day before the calends of May, and sent his soul ex-
ulting in the triumph of martyrdom to heaven. On the
Allowing day his body was carried to London, and being
received with due honor by the citizens, was buried by the
bishops Ednoth of Lincoln, and Alphune of London, in the
church of Saint Paul.*

After this, when the tribute had been paid and peace es-
tablished with the Danes on oath, the Danish fleet which had
been collected, dispersed far and wide; but five-and-forty
ships remained with the king, and swore fealty to him, and

promised that they would defend England, on condition of his
giving them food and clothing.

In the year 1013, Living was appointed to the archbishopric
of Canterbury. In the month of July, Sweyn, king of the
Danes, arrived at the port of Sandwich with a strong fleet,
and after remaining there a few days, took his departure, and
sailing round East Anglia, entered the mouth of the river
Humber, from which, entering the river Trent, he sailed up
to Gainesburg, 37 where he pitched his camp. Without delay
there made submission to him, first, earl Ucthred and the
people of Northumbria and Lindesey, and after them the people
of the Five Boroughs, 33 next all the people living in the dis-
trict north of Watlingastrete, the road which the sons of king
Wethle made through England, from the Eastern Sea to the
Western; all these made submission, and having entered
into a treaty of peace with him and given hostages, swore
fealty to him, and were ordered to provide horses and food
for his army.

These things being done, and the fleet with the hostages
entrusted to his son Canute, he took chosen men as auxiliaries
from those who had been surrendered, and made an expedi-
tion against the South Mercians. Having passed over Wat-
lingastrete, he issued an edict to his followers that they
should lay waste the fields, burn the towns, spoil the churches,
slay without regard or mercy all those of the male sex who
should fall in their hands, and reserve the females to satisfy
their lust, doing all the mischief they possibly could.

They acting in this manner, and raving with the rabidness
of wild beasts, he came to Oxford, and took it more speedily
than he had previously expected ; having received hostages,
he passed on in haste to Winchester, and arriving there,
the citizens, being alarmed, made peace with him without
delay, and gave him hostages, such and as many as he de-
manded. Having received these, he moved on his army to-
wards London ; and great numbers of them being drowned
in the river Thames, perished there, having never attempted
to find either a bridge or a ford. On arriving at London, he
endeavoured in many ways to capture it either by stratagem or
by force.

A.D. 1014. SWEYN'S EXACTIONS. 93

But Egelred, king of the English, with the citizens and the
aid of the Danish earl, Turkill, so often mentioned, who was
with him at the time, manfully defended the walls of the
city, and held out against him. Being repulsed, he repaired
first to Wallingford, then to Bath, ravaging and laying waste
everything in his progress, according to his usual practice, and
there he sat down with his forces to refresh them. Then came
to him Athelmar, the earl of Devon, and with him the thanes of
the west, and having made peace with him, gave him hostages.
All these things heing thus accomplished to his wish, on return-
ing to his fleet, he was by all the -people styled and considered
king, although he acted in most respects in a tyrannical manner.

The citizens of London, also, sent hostages to him, and made
peace with him; for they were afraid that his fury would
he so inflamed against them, that, taking away all their pos-
sessions, he would either order their eyes to be put out, or
their hands or feet to be cut off". "When king Egelred saw this,
he sent queen Emma by sea to Normandy, to her brother
Eichard, the second duke of Normandy, and her sons Edward
and Elfred, together with their tutor, Elphune, bishop of
London, and Elfsy, abbat of Medeshampstead. 39 But he him-
self remained for some time with the Danish 40 fleet, which lay
in the Thames at a place called Grenwic ; 41 and afterwards
proceeding to the Isle of "Wight, there celebrated the Nativity
of our Lord ; after which, he passed over to Normandy, and
was honorably entertained by duke Richard.

In the mean time, the tyrant Sweyn ordered provisions to be
prepared in abundance for his fleet, and an amount of tribute
to be paid that could hardly be endured. In like manner, in
all respects, earl Turkill ordered payment to be made to the
fleet which lay at Grenwic. In addition to all this, each of
tlfem, as often as they thought proper, collected spoil, and did
much mischief.

In the year 1014, the tyrant Sweyn, after innumerable and
cruel misdeeds, which he had been guilty of either in England
or in other countries, to complete his own damnation, dared to
exact a heavy tribute from the town where lies interred the
uncorrupted body of the royal martyr, Edmund ; a thing that
no one had dared to do before, from the time when that town 48

had been given to the church of the above-named saint ; he
repeatedly threatened, also, that if it was not quickly paid,
beyond a doubt he would burn the town, together with the
townsmen, utterly destroy the church of the martyr himself,
and torment the clergy with various tortures. In addition to
this, he even dared frequently to speak slightingly of the martyr
himself, and to say that he was no saint at all. But, inasmuch
as he was unwilling to put an end to his misdeeds, the Divine
vengeance did not permit this blasphemer to live any longer.

At length, towards the evening of the dny on which, in a
general council which he had held at a place which is called
Geagnesburt, 43 he had again repeated these threats, while sur-
rounded with most numerous crowds of Danes, he alone beheld
Saint Edmund coming armed towards him ; on seeing whom,
he was terrified, and began to cry out with loud shrieks, ex-
claiming, "Fellow-soldiers, to the rescue, to the rescue! be-
hold Saint Edmund has come to slay me ;" after saying which,
being pierced by the Saint with a spear, he fell from the
throne 41 upon which he was sitting, and, suffering great tor-
ments until nightfall, on the third day before the nones of
February, terminated his life by a shocking death.

After his death, the fleet of the Danes elected his son,
Canute, king. But the elders of the whole of England, with
one consent, in all haste sent messengers to king Egelred,
declaring that they loved no one, and would love no one, more
than their own natural lord, if he would either rule them more
becomingly, or treat them with more mildness than he had pre-
viously done. On hearing this, he sent his son, Edward, to them,
with his deputies, and in a friendly way greeted his people,
both great and small, promising that he would be to them a
loving and affectionate lord, and would consult their wishes
in all things, would listen to their advice, and with a for-
giving temper pardon whatever had been said in abuse, or
done in contradiction by them to himself or his family ; if,
on the other hand, they would be ready to restore him with
unanimity and without guile, to his kingdom. To this they
all made answer in kindly terms, and full friendship was

established on either side, both by words and by pledge. In
addition to this, the nobles unanimously made promise that they
would no more admit a Danish king into England.

On these things being concluded, a deputation was sent by
the English to Normandy, and the king was brought back in
all haste during the season of Lent, and received with due
honor by all. In the meantime it was arranged by Canute
and the men of Lindesey, 45 that, procuring horses for the
army, they should make a descent for the purpose of plun-
der. But, before they were prepared, king Egelred came
thither with a strong army, -and, Canute with his fleet
being put to flight, laid waste the whole of Lindesey, and
ravaged it with fire, slaughtering all the inhabitants he could.
But Canute, at once taking safety in flight, directed his course
towards the south of England, and in a short time came to the
port of Sandwich, where he put on shore the hostages that had
been given to his father by the whole of England, and, having
cut off their hands, ears, and nostrils, allowed them to de-
part, and then set sail for Denmark, to return in the ensuing
year. In addition to all these evils, king Edward ordered to
be paid to the fleet, which lay at Grenwic, a tribute which
amounted to thirty thousand pounds.

On the third day before the calends of October, the sea
overflowed its shores, and drowned a great number of towns
in England and numberless multitudes of people.

In the year 1015, while a great council was being held in
secret at Oxford, the perfidious duke Edric Streona, by strata-
gem enticed Sigeferth and Morcar, the sons of Earngrim, the
very worthy and influential thanes of the Seven Boroughs,
into his chamber, and there ordered them to be put to death.
King Egelred thereupon took possession of their property, and
dered Aldgitha, the relict of Sigeferth, to be taken to the city
of Maidulph. 46 While she was being kept in confinement there,
Edmund, the king's son, surnamed Ironside, came thither, and,
against the will of his father, 47 took her to wife, and, between
the feasts of the Assumption and the Nativity of Saint Mary,
set out for the Five Boroughs, and invading the territories of
Sigeferth and Morcar, subjected their people to himself.

At the same time, Canute, king of the Danes, came with a
great fleet to the port of Sandwich ; and then, sailing round
Kent, entered the mouth of the river Frome, and collected
great booty in Dorsetshire, Somersetshire, and the province
of Winchester. 48 At this period, because king Egebred lay
sick at Corsham, the Clito Edmund, his son, acted in his
behalf, and, with the duke Edric Streona, who was full of
guile and treachery, collected a large army : but, when they
had met together, duke Edric in every possible way laid snares
for the Clito Edmund, and tried by treachery to cut him
off. On Edmund learning this, they soon separated from each
other, and left the place to the enemy. Not long after
this, the same duke enticed away forty ships of the royal
fleet, manned with Danish soldiers, and, going over to Canute,
made submission to him. The men of "Wessex did the same, and
gave hostages, and afterwards provided horses for his army.

In the year 1016, Canute, king of the Danes, and the per-
fidious duke Edric Streona, with a large retinue, 49 crossed the
river Thames at a place which is called Cricklade ; and, on
the approach of the Epiphany of our Lord, made a hostile
irruption into Mercia, and laying waste many towns in the
province of Warwick, burned them, and slew all the persons
they could find. When the Clito Edmund, surnamed Ironside,
heard of this, in all haste he collected an army ; but, after it
was brought together, the men of Mercia were unwilling to
engage with the men of Wessex and the Danes, unless king
Egebred and the citizens of London were with them. In con-
sequence of this, the expedition was given up, and each one
returned home.

After the festival was concluded, the Clito Edmund again
formed a still greater army ; after which, he sent messengers
to London, to beg his father to meet him as soon as possi-
ble, with all the men he could find. But, after an army had
been collected together, intimation was given to the king,
that, if he did not take due precaution, some of his allies were
about to betray him. The army was soon broken up in conse-
quence, on which he returned to London; but the Clito proceeded
to Northumbria. For which reason some thought that he still
intended to form a greater army against Canute ; but in the

same way that Canute and Edric did on their part, so did he
and Ucthred, the earl of Northumbria, lay waste some of the
provinces. For first they ravaged Staffordshire, and next the
provinces of Shrewsbury and Leicester, because they had re-
fused to go out to fight against the army of the Danes.

In the meantime, Canute and Edric Streona laid waste, first
the provinces of Buckinghamshire, Bedfordshire, Huntingdon-
shire, Northamptonshire, Somersetshire, and Nottinghamshire,
and, afterwards, Northumbria. On hearing this, the Clito
Edmund Ironside, pausing in his ravages, hastened to London
to his father ; while, on the other hand, earl Ucthred returned
home with all speed, and, compelled by necessity, betook him-
self, with all the Northumbrians, to Canute, and gave him
hostages ; yet, for all that, either by his command or with his
sanction, he was slain by Turebrand, a noble Dane, together
with Turketel, the son of Navena. After his death, Canute
appointed Eiric earl in place of Ucthred ; and after that, re-
turning in all haste to the south, 50 before the festival of
Easter, with the whole of his army retreated to his ships.

At this period, in the fourth year of the indiction, on the
ninth day before the calends of May, being the second day of
the week, Egelred, king of the English, departed this life at
London, after having in his life experienced great troubles and
many tribulations, which Saint Dunstan had prophesied to
him should come upon him for the death of his brother
Edward, as I have mentioned under the first year of his reign.
His body was becomingly buried in the church of Saint Paul.

After his death, the bishops, abbats, and most noble men
of England met together and with one consent elected Canute
their lord and king, and coming to him at Southampton, re-
pudiated and rejected in his presence all the family of king
Egelred, and made peace with him, and took the oaths of fealty
to him ; on which he swore to them that before God and men
he would be a faithful master to them.

But the citizens of London, and a part of the nobles who
were at that time staying there, with unanimous consent
elected the Clito Edmund king, who, being thus elevated to
the royal throne, fearlessly entered Wessex, and being received
by all the people with great congratulations, reduced it very

haste to the south by another road."

speedily to subjection ; on hearing which, many of the people
of England with alacrity voluntarily submitted to him.
But Canute, in the meanwhile, aboxit the time of the Rogation
days, came up with all his fleet to London ; and on arriving
there, the Danes dug a great ditch 81 on the southern side of
the Thames, and towed their ships along to the western side,
after which, surrounding the city with a wide and deep
trench, in strict siege they shut out all from either ingress or
egress. They also made frequent attempts to take it by storm ;
but, the citizens making a stout resistance against them, they
were repulsed from the walls ; in consequence whereof, the
siege being put off for a time, and a part of the army left to
guard the ships, they hastened with all speed to Wessex, and
gave king Edmund Ironside no time for collecting a large army.
However, with the army which in such a short period he had
collected, relying on the aid of God, he boldly met them in
Dorsetshire, and attacking them at a place which is called
Penn, 52 near Gillingham, fought with them, and conquered,
and put them to flight. After this, midsummer being past,
he again collected a still larger army than before, and re-
solved to engage boldly with Canute ; this took place in Wor-
cestershire, at a place which is called Eearstam, 53 where he
drew up his army as the situation and his own strength would
allow him, and placing all his best men in the front rank, the
rest of the army he set in reserve ; and then appealed to them,
calling each by name, and exhorting and entreating them that
they would bear in mind that they were fighting for their
country, their children, their wives, and their homes ; and, in
the most encouraging language having kindled the spirits of the
soldiers, he then ordered the trumpets to sound, and his troops
to advance at a gentle pace. The army of the enemy did the
same. When they had come to the spot where the battle was
able to be commenced, with immense clamour they rushed on
with hostile standards, and the combat was waged with lances

51 This is supposed to have been commenced on Ihe eastern side of
London Bridge, at either Deptford or Rotherhithe, and running through
the present St. George's Fields, to have entered the river at Vauxhall.

and swords, and the engagement carried on with the greatest
vigour. In the meantime, king Edmund Ironside fought bravely
in the front rank, hand to hand, while giving all requisite
orders. He himself fought most valiantly, and struck down
many an enemy, at the same moment performing the duties
of a valiant soldier and of a good general ; but, inasmuch as
his brother-in-law Edric Streona, that most perfidious duke,
and Almar the beloved, and Algar, the son of Mehu, who
ought to have been aiding him, together with the men of the
provinces of Southampton and Wiltshire, and an innumer-
able multitude of people, were on the side of the Danes, his
army had to struggle hard for victory.

However, on the first day of the week, Monday to wit, so
severe and so bloody a battle was fought, that either army, from
exhaustion being no longer able to -fight, at sunset ceased of
its own accord. Still, on the following day, king Edmund
would have crushed all the Danes, if it had not been for the
treachery of the perfidious duke Edric Streona. For, when the
battle was at its height, and he saw that the English were
prevailing, having cut off the head of a man, Osmer by name,
who very strongly resembled king Edward in features and
hair, raising it aloft, he exclaimed : " Englishmen ! it is in
vain you fight!" adding, "You men of Dorset, Devon, and
Wiltshire, your chieftain is slain, take to flight with all
speed. 54 Behold the head of Edmund, your king ! I hold it
in my hand; give way, then, instantly !"

When the English heard this, they were more shocked at the
atrocity of the deed than alarmed through belief in him who
announced it. Hence it came to pass that the more unsteady
ones were nearly taking to flight, but instantly, on it being
found that the king was alive, they recovered their courage,
nd boldly rushing upon the Danes, slaughtered many of them,
fighting with all their might until twilight, on the approach of
which, as on the preceding day, they separated of their own
accord. But when the greater part of the night had passed,
Canute commanded his men to decamp in silence, and taking
the road towards London, returned to the ships, and shortly
after again laid siege to it.

On the next day, when king Edmund Ironside found that
the Danes had fled, he returned into Wessex to collect a

larger army. His brother-in-law, the perfidious duke Edric,
seeing his valour, sought him again as his natural lord, and
making peace with him, swore that he would continue faithful
to him; upon which, with an army collected together for
the third time, the king liberated the citizens of London from
the siege, and drove the Danes to their ships. Two days after
this, he passed over the Thames at a place which is called
Brentford, to engage with the Danes for the third time ; there
he joined battle with them, and having put them to flight,
gained the victory. On this occasion many men on the side
of the English, while crossing the river without due precau-
tions, were drowned. After this, the king hastened to Wessex,
for the purpose of collecting a more numerous army ; on which,
the Danes again repaired to London, laid siege to it, and stormed
it on every side ; but, by the aid of God, they were unsuc-
cessful.

Upon this, they returned thence with their fleet, and entered
the river which is called Are we, 55 and, landing from their
ships, proceeded into Mercia for the purpose of plunder, after
their usual manner slaughtering all they met, burning towns,
and carrying off the spoil : after which, they returned to their
ships, and the land forces were conveyed by sea to the river
which is called Meodewege, 55 while the cavalry endeavoured to
drive the live-stock, which formed part of their booty, by land.

In the meantime, king Edmund Ironside for the fourth time
collected a valiant army throughout the whole of England, and
passing over the Thames at the place 57 where he had done
so previously, quickly entered Kent, and fought a battle with
the Danes near Ottaford ; on which, being unable to resist his
attack, they turned their backs and fled with their horses to
Scepege. 58 However, he slew all he could overtake, and had
not the perfidious duke Edric Streona, with his treachery,
withheld him at Eagleford, 59 from pursuing the enemy, he
would that day have gained a complete victory. After re-
turning into Wessex, Canute crossed over with his forces into
Essex, and proceeded again to Mercia, for the sake of plun-
der, giving orders to his army to commit still greater excesses
than before.

A.D. 1016. PROPOSED DIVISION OF THE KINGDOM. 101

On this, with the greatest alacrity, they obeyed his com-
mands, and having slaughtered all who fell into their hands,
and burned a very great number of towns, and laid waste
the fields, greatly enriched, they repaired with all haste to
their ships. Edmund Ironside, king of the English, pur-
suing them with an army which he had levied from the
whole of England, came up with them, as they were retreat-
ing, at a hill which is called Assendun, 60 that is to say, "the hill
of the ass." There, with all expedition, he drew up his troops
in three divisions, and then going round each troop, exhorted
and entreated them, bearing in mind their ancient valour and
victories, to defend him and his kingdom from the avarice of
the Danes, and reminded them that they were about to engage
with those whom they had conquered already.

In the meantime, Canute slowly led his forces to a level
spot ; while, on the other hand, king Edmund quickly moved
his line in the order in which he had drawn it up, and sud-
denly giving the signal, fell upon the Danes ; on both sides
they fought with the greatest valour, and in every quarter
multitudes fell. But that most perfidious and most wicked
duke, Edric Streona, seeing the line of the Danes wavering, and
the English likely to gain the victory, just as he had previously
arranged with Canute, took to flight with the people of Mai-
seveth 61 and the part of the army which he commanded, and
by treachery betrayed his lord, king Edmund, and the army
of the English. There were slain in that battle duke Alfric,
duke Godwin, Ulfketel duke of East Anglia, duke Ethelward,
son of Ethelwin, the friend of God, duke of East Anglia, and
almost the entire mass of the nobility of England, which in
no battle ever sustained a greater wound than it did there.
Eadnoth, also, the bishop of Lincoln, and the abbat "Wulsy,
who had come for the purpose of invoking the Lord on behalf
of the soldiers while waging the battle, were slain.

A few days having intervened after this, king Edmund
Ironside being still desirous to come up with Canute, while
the most iniquitous and treacherous Edric and some others
did not wish that to take place, they gave him advice to make
peace with Canute and divide the kingdom between them.
At length, though with some reluctance, he yielded to their
suggestions, and messengers going from one to the other, and

hostages being given on either side, the two kings met at a place
which is called Deerhurst ; Edmund pitched his camp with
his men on the western bank of the Severn, while Canute en-
camped with his on the eastern side.

Upon this, the two kings were conveyed in boats 63 to the
island called Olanege, 64 which is situate in the middle of the
river; where 65 peace, friendship, and brotherhood having
been established by pledge and by oath, the kingdom was
divided. Then, after having exchanged arms and clothes, the
tribute being agreed upon which should be paid to the
fleet, they separated from each other. The Danes, however,
returned to their ships with the spoil which they had col-
lected, and the citizens of London made peace with them,
paying a price for it, and allowing them to winter there.

After these things, in the fifteenth year of the indiction,
about the time of the feast of Saint Andrew the Apostle,
king Edmund Ironside died at London, 66 but was buried at
Glastonbury, with his grandfather, king Edgar the Peaceful.
After his death, king Canute ordered all the bishops and chief-
tains, and all the nobles and principal men of the English
nation, to be assembled at London. When these had come before
him, as though he did not know it, he cunningly asked those
who had acted as witnesses between him and king Edmund
when they made the treaty of friendship and partition of the
kingdom between them, to what effect he and king Edmund
had expressed themselves about the brothers and sons of the
latter, as to whether it should be allowed the same to reign
over the kingdom of "Wessex after their father, in case Ed-
mund should die while he was still living : on which they began
to say that, beyond a doubt, they were quite certain that king
Edmund neither living nor dying had bespoken any portion of
the kingdom for his brothers. But, as to his sons, they said
that they knew this, that king Edmund wished Canute to
be their guardian and protector, until they should be of fit age
to reign.

63 " Trabariae," the word used in the text, were boats like canoes, made
out of a single piece of wood. 61 Olney.

65 According to Roger of Wendover and other historians, Edmund
Ironside and Canute first engaged there in single combat.

66 Roger of Wendover says at Oxford, where he was barbarously mur-
dered by the son of Edric Streona.



A.D. 1017. CANUTE DIVIDES THE KINGDOM, 103

Uut they, God testifying thereto, gave false testimony and
treacherously lied, thinking both that Canute would prove more
kind to them by reason of their falsehoods, and that they should
gain great rewards from him ; whereas, not long after, some of
these false witnesses were slain by the same king. After having
put the above question, king Canute received the oaths of
fealty from the nobles above-mentioned ; on which they swore
to him that they willingly chose him for their king, and would
readily obey him, and pay tribute to his army ; and having
received pledges from his bare hand, together with the oaths
of the principal men among .the Danes, they utterly dis-
regarded the brothers and sons of king Edmund, and declared
that they should not be their kings.

Now, one of the above-mentioned Clito's was Edwin the Ex-
cellent, a most revered brother of king Edmund, whom on that
occasion, with most wicked counsels, they pronounced deserving
of banishment. When, therefore, Canute had listened to the
adulation of the persons above-mentioned, and the contempt in
which they held Edwin, rejoicing, "he entered his chamber, and
calling to him the perfidious duke Edric, inquired of him in what
way he might be able to beguile Edwin to the risk of his life ;
on which Edric made answer, that he knew a certain man
named Athelward, who could very easily put him to death,
with whom he should be able to have some conversation, and
to whom he would offer a very considerable reward.

However, on learning the name of the man, the king cun-
ningly sent for him, and said : " Thus and thus has duke
Edric informed me, saying that you are able to beguile the
Clito Edwin, so that he may be slain ; do you only assent to
my proposal, and obtain for me his head, and you shall enjoy
all the honors and dignities of your forefathers, and shall be
dearer to me than my own born brother." On this, he made
answer that he was willing to seek for him in order that he
might be slain, if in any way he could effect it : but, in reality,
he did not wish to kill him at present, but, by way of excuse,
made this promise : he was a person sprung from a most
noble English family.

In this year king Canute obtained the rule of the whole of
England, and divided it into four parts; Wessex he took for him-
self, East Anglia he gave to earl Turkill, Mercia to the perfidious
duke Edric, and Northumbria to earl Eiric. He also made a
treaty with the nobles and all the people, and they established



104 AJfNALS OP HOGEK DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1018.

by oath a firm friendship between them, and, laying them aside,
set at rest all ancient enmities. Then, by the counsel of the
perfidious duke Edric, king Canute banished the Clito Edwin,
the brother of king Edmund, and Edwin, 67 who was styled
"the King of the Churls;" but this Edwin was reconciled
to the king. The Clito Edwin, however, being deceived by
tlie treachery of those whom he had hitherto deemed to be most
friendly disposed to him, at the request and entreaty of king
Canute, was, the samey ear, without guilt on his part, put to death.

Edric also gave him this advice, that he should put to death
the younger Clito's, Edward and Edmund, the sons of king
Edmund ; but as it seemed to him a great disgrace for them
to be put to death in England, after the lapse of a short time he
sent them to the king of Sweden to be slain; he however,
although there was a treaty between them, would by no means
assent to his request, but sent them, for the preservation of
their lives, to Salomon, king of the Hungarians, to be brought
up ; and one of them, namely, Edmund, in process of time, ended
his life there. But Edward received in marriage Agatha, the
daughter of the emperor, by whom he had Margaret, after-
wards queen of the Scots, Christina, a virgin, who became a
nun, and the Clito Edgar.

In the month of July, king Canute took to wife queen
Emma, the widow of king Egebred, by whom he had a son,
named Hardicanute, afterwards king, and a daughter, named
Gunhilda, who was afterwards married to Henry, the emperor
of the Romans.

In the year 1018, at the Feast of the Nativity of our Lord,
while Canute was in London, he ordered the perfidious duke
Edric Streona to be slain in his palace, because he feared lest he
should be on some occasion betrayed by his treachery, just as
his former masters Egelred and Edmund had been frequently
betrayed. He also ordered his body to be thrown over the walls
of the city, and to be cast out without burial ; together with
him duke Norman, the son of duke Leofwin, and brother of
earl Leofric, Ethelward, the son of duke Engelmar, and
Brithric, the son of Elphege, earl of Devonshire, were slain
without any guilt on their parts. In this year, by the whole
of England, seventy-two pounds, and by London, four hundred
and ten pounds, 68 were paid to the army of the Danes. Aldun,

bishop of Durham, departed this life, and a great battle was
fought between the English and the Scots at Carre. 69 The
English and the Danes came to an understanding at Oxford
as to the observance of the laws of king Edgar.

In the year 1019, Canute, king of the English and of the
Danes, crossed to Denmark, and remained there throughout the
whole of the winter.

In the year 1020, king Canute returned to England, and at
the festival of Easter held a great council at Cirencester.
Edmund was appointed to the see of Durham, and Living,
archbishop of Canterbury, departing this life, was succeeded
by Agelnoth, who was called the Good, the son of Agelmar, a
nobleman. In the same year, the church which king Canute
and earl Turketel had built on the hill which is called Assen-
dun, 70 was dedicated in their presence with great honor and pomp
by Wulstan, the archbishop of York, and many other bishops.

In the year 1021, Canute, king of the English and of the
Danes, before the feast of Saint Martin, expelled the earl Tur-
kill so often mentioned, together with his wife, Egitha, from
England. Algar, the bishop of East Anglia, departed this life,
and was succeeded by Alfwin.

In the year 1022, Agelnoth, the archbishop of Canterbury,
went to Rome, and being received by pope Benedict with great
honor, the pall was given to him.

In the year 1023, the body of Saint Elphege the Martyr
was transferred from London to Canterbury. Wulstan, the
archbishop of York, departed this life at York, on the day before
the calends of July, being the third day of the week, but
his body was carried to Ely, and there buried. He was suc-
ceeded by Alfric, the prior of Winchester.

In the year 1026, Alfric, the archbishop of York, went to

second duke of Normandy, departed this life ; and was suc-
ceeded by Richard the Third, who died in the same year, being
succeeded by his brother Robert.

In the year 1027, it having been intimated to the king of the
English and of the Danes that the people of Norway greatly
despised their king, Olaf, for his simplicity, mildness, justice

that paid by the city of London, 10,500.

and piety, lie sent to certain of them a great quantity of gold
and silver, begging them, with many intreaties, that, having
deposed and expelled him, they would become subject to
him, and permit him to reign over them. Receiving, with
great avidity, what he sent them, they ordered word to be
sent him, that they were ready to receive him whenever he
chose to come.

In the year 1028, Canute, king of the English and of the
Danes, crossing over to Norway with fifty large ships, expelled
king Olaf, and rendered it subject to himself.

In the year 1 029, Canute, king of the English, of the Danes,
and of the Norwegians, returned to England ; and shortly after
Bent into exile Hacun, a Danish earl, on the pretext that he
was sending him on an embassy, as he feared lest he should
be deprived of his life by him. He was married to a noble
woman, Gunhilda, the daughter of his own sister and of
"Wertgeorn, king of the Windi.

In the year 1030, the above-named earl Hacun perished at
sea; some say that he was slain at this period in the island of
Orkney. Saint Olaf, the king and martyr, son of Harold, king
of Norway, whom king Canute had expelled, returning to
Norway, was unrighteously slain by the Norwegians.

In the year 1031, Canute, king of the English, of the
Danes, and of the Norwegians, set out with great state from
Denmark for Rome, and presented to Saint Peter, the chief of
the Apostles, vast gifts of gold and silver and other precious
things, and obtained, at his request, from pope John, that the
school of the English at Rome should be exempt from all
tax and tribute; also, in going and returning he bestowed
bounteous alms on the poor, and put an end to many barriers on
the road where toll was exacted from strangers, by payment
of a large sum of money ; before the tomb of the Apostles he
also made a vow to amend his life and manners.

In the year 1032, the church of Saint Edmund, the king and
martyr, was dedicated. Conflagrations, almost unextinguish-
able, ravaged many places throughout England. Elphege,
the bishop of Winchester, departed this life, and was succeeded
by Elfwyn, the king's priest.

In the year 1033, died Leolf, bishop of the Wiccii, 72 a
man of great piety and modesty, at the episcopal town of
73 Worcester.

Kemeys. 73 He died on the fourth day before the calends of
September, being the third day of the week, and, as we have
reason to believe, departed to the kingdom of heaven ; his body
was buried with due honor in the church of Saint Mary, at
Worcester. To his see was elected Brithege, abbat of Per-
shore, son of the sister of Wulstan, the archbishop of York.

In the year 1034, Malcolm, 74 the king of the Scots, departed
this life, and was succeeded by Machetad.

In the year 1035, Canute, king of the English, just before
his death appointed his son, Sweyn, king of the Norwegians ;
and of the Danes Hardicanute,- his son by queen Emma ; his
son Harold, whom he had by Elfgiva of Southampton, he ap-
pointed king of England ; and shortly after, in the same
year, on the second day before the ides of November, being
the fourth day of the week, he departed this life at Shaftes-
bury, but was buried at Winchester, with all due honors,
in the old monastery there. After his burial, queen Elfgiva, 76
who was also called Emma, took refuge 16 at that place.

But Harold, on obtaining the royal dignity, sent his follow-
ers with all haste to Winchester, and took away from her, in a
tyrannical manner, the largest and best portion of the treasures
which king Canute had left her ; and after having spoiled her,
dismissed her, to take her seat there as she had previously done.
With the consent, also, of the greater part of the elders of
England he began to reign, as being the lawful heir; but
yet not with such power as did Canute, because [by some]
Hardicanute was looked for as being the more lawful heir.
For which reason, shortly afterwards, the kingdom of England
was divided by lot, and the northern part fell to Harold, the
southern to Hardicanute. Robert, duke of the Normans, died,
and was succeeded by his son, William the Bastard, at a very
youthful age.

In the year 1036, the innocent Clito's Alfred and Edward,
the sons of Egelred, the former king of the English, crossed
over to England with a few ships from Normandy, where they
had remained for a long time with their uncle Richard, and,

73 In Pembrokeshire. 71 The Second.

75 A suspicion is mentioned by some of the chroniclers that this woman
palmed off the children of a priest and a cobbler on Canute as his own.
She herself was the daughter of earl Elfelm.

76 This was for protection from the violence of Harold.

attended by a great number of Norman soldiers, came to
Winchester, to have an interview with their mother, who was
staying at that place. This some of the men in power took
amiss, and were indignant at it ; because, although unjustly
BO, they were much more devoted to king Harold than to them,
and especially, as it is said, the earl Godwin.

He, after having hurried on Alfred towards London for the
purpose of an interview with king Harold, in obedience
to his commands, detained him and placed him in close cus-
tody. Some of his attendants he dispersed, some he placed
in chains, and afterwards put out their eyes ; some he scalped
and tortured, and deprived of their handy and feet, by cutting
them off. Many, also, he caused to be sold, and by various
and shocking deaths he put to death six hundred men at
Guilford. But their souls, we believe, are now rejoicing in
Paradise with the Saints, whose bodies, without cause, were
so cruelly consigned to death on earth.

On hearing this, queen Emma in great haste sent back her
son Edward, who had remained with her, into Normandy ;
whereupon, by the command of Godwin and certain others, the
Clito Alfred was led in the most strict bonds to the isle of Ely ;
but as soon as the ship came to shore, on board of it, they in-
stantly in the most cruel manner put out his eyes, and then,
being led to the monastery by the monks, he was delivered into
their charge ; here, shortly afterwards, he departed this life,
and his body was buried with due honor in the south porch
on the western side of the church, while his soul enjoys the
delights of Paradise.

In the year 1037, Harold king of the Mercians and Nor-
thumbrians, was chosen king by the nobles and the people, to
reign over all England. But Hardicanute, because he stayed
too long in Denmark and delayed coming to England as he had
been requested, was entirely set aside, and his mother Elfgiva,
who was also called Emma, the former queen of the English,
at the beginning of the winter, was expelled from England
without mercy, and shortly afterwards, passing over in a ship to
Flanders, was received with honor by earl Baldwin. He, in
the way that became such a man, as long as her need demanded
it, willingly took care that all necessaries were provided her.
In the same year, a short time before this, Avic, the prior of
Evesham, a man of great piety, died.



A.D. 1040 TETBrTE PAID TO HABDICAXTTTE. 109

In the year 1038, Egelnoth, archbishop of Canterbury, de-
parted this life, on the fourth day before the calends of Novem-
ber, on the seventh day after whose death, Egelred, bishop of
Sussex, 77 died : for he had asked of God, that he might not
live long in this world after the death of his most beloved father
Egelnoth. Grimketel succeeded Egelred in the bishopric, and
Eadsy, the king's chaplain, succeeded Egelnoth as archbishop.
In the same year also, died Brithege, the bishop of Worcester,
on the fourteenth day before the calends of January, being the
fourth day of the week, and was succeeded by Living.

In the year 1039, there was a very severe storm. Brithmar,
bishop of Lichfield, died, and was succeeded by Wulsy. Hardi-
canute, king of the Danes, crossed over to Flanders, and visited
his mother Emma.

[In the year 1040], Harold, the king of the English, died at
London, and was buried at Westminster ; after his burial, the
nobles of almost the whole of England sent ambassadors to
Hardicanute at Bruges, where he was staying with his mother,
and thinking that they were acting rightly, entreated him to
come to England, and receive the sceptre of the kingdom. Having
prepared forty ships, and equipped them with Danish soldiers, be-
fore midsummer he arrived in England, and was joyfully re-
ceived by all, and shortly after elevated to the throne of the
kingdom. But, during the period of his reign, he did nothing
worthy of the royal dignity. For as soon as he began to reign,
not forgetting the injuries which his predecessor Harold, (who
was supposed to he his brother), had done either to him or to his
mother, he sent Elfric, archbishop of York, earl Godwin,
Stir, master of the household, Edric, his keeper of the purse,
Thrond, his executioner, and other men of high rank to
London, and ordered them to dig up the body of Harold, and
cast it into a swampy place. After it had been thrown up on
shore there, he ordered it to be dragged out, and to be cast into
the river Thames. But a short time after, it was taken up by
a certain fisherman, and carried off in haste by the Danes,
and honorably buried by them in the burying ground which
they had at London.

These things being done, king Hardicanute ordered eight
marks to be paid by the whole of England to each rower,
and twelve to each pilot of his fleet, a tribute so heavy, that
17 Bishop of Selsey.



110 AlTffALS OF BOGER DE HOVEDEIT. A .D. 1041.

hardly any person, was able to pay it. In consequence of this,
to all who, before his arrival, greatly wished for it, he be-
eame exceedingly odious. Added to this, he was extremely exas-
perated against earl Godwin, and Living, the bishop of "Wor-
cester, for the death of his brother Alfred, Alfric, the archbishop
of York, and certain others being their accusers. He therefore
took away the bishopric of Worcester from Living, and gave it
to Alfric ; but in the following year he took it from Alfric, and
restored it, with marks of kindness, to Living, with whom he
had become reconciled.

But Godwin, to make his peace, presented to the king a galley
or ship, of exquisite workmanship, having a gilded beak, pro-
vided with the choicest equipments, and fitted out with splendid
arms and eight hundred 78 picked soldiers. Each one of these
had on his arms bracelets of gold, weighing sixteen ounces, a
triple coat of mail, a helmet on his head partly gilded, a
sword girt to his loins with a gilded hilt, a Danish battle-axe
ornamented with gold hanging from the left shoulder, in his
left hand a shield, the boss and studs of which were gilded,
and in his right a lance, which in the English language is
called " Ategar."

In addition to this, he made oath before the king, and almost
all the nobles and most dignified thanes of England, that it
was neither by his advice or concurrence that his brother had
been deprived of his sight, but that his lord, king Harold, had
ordered him to do what he did do.

In the year 1041, Hardicanute, king of the English, sent the
servants of his household throughout all the provinces of the
kingdom, to collect the tribute which he had ordered. A
sedition arising in consequence, two of them, Feader and Tur-
stan by name, were slain by the people of the province of Wor-
cester and the citizens, in the upper room of a tower in the
monastery of Worcester, whither they had fled for the purpose
of concealment ; this took place on the fourth day before the
nones of May, being the second day of the week. In con-
sequence of this, the king, being aroused to anger, for the purpose
of avenging their death, despatched thither, Thuri, earl of Mid-
Anglia, Leofric, earl of Mercia, Godwin, earl of Wessex, Si-

7* " Octingesimo " in the text. Eighty, spite of the eight hundred of
Roger of Wendover, is much more probable.

ward, earl of Northumbria, Rome, earl of Maiseveth, 79 and
the earls of the whole of England, and nearly all his own
household servants, with a great army, Alfric then being
bishop of Worcester ; these he sent thither, with orders to
slay all they could, and, after plundering the city, to set it on
fire and lay waste the whole province.

A short time after the feast of All Saints, they began to lay
waste the city and the province, and ceased not to do so for
four days ; however, they took and slew but few of the citizens
or provincials, because, their approach being known beforehand,
the provincials had taken to flight in various directions ; but
a multitude of the citizens had fled for refuge to a certain
little island, situate in the middle of the river Severn, which
is called Beverege, and, having thrown up fortifications there,
stoutly defended themselves against their enemies, until peace
was restored and they had free liberty to return home. On the
fifth day, therefore, after the burning of the city, every man
returned home laden with considerable spoil, and the king's
anger was immediately appeased. Not long after this, Edward,
the son of Egelred the former king of the English, came to
England from Normandy, where he had been in exile many
years, and being honorably entertained by his brother, king
Hardicanute, took up his residence at his court.

In the year 1042, Hardicanute, king of the English, was
present at a banquet, at which Osgod Clapa, a man of high rank,
was marrying his daughter Gyta, to Tuvy, a Dane, and a very
influential man, at a place which is called Lamtithe j 80 while
in merry mood, and in perfect health and good spirits, he was
enjoying the hilarity of the nuptials by the side of the bride,
and standing up, was drinking to certain men, he suddenly fell
to the earth with a dreadful shock, and remaining speechless,
^expired on the sixth day before the ides of July, being the third
day of the week, and being carried to Winchester, was buried
near king Canute, his father.

Upon this, his brother Edward, by the especial aid of earl
Godwin and Living, the bishop of Worcester, was elevated to
the dignity of king, at London ; his father was Egelred, whose

father was Edgar, whose father was Edmund, whose father
was Edward the Elder, whose father was Alfred.

In the year from the incarnation of our Lord 1043, on the
first day of Easter, being the nones of April, Edward was
anointed king at Winchester, by Eadsy, archbishop of Canter-
bury, and Alfric, archbishop of York, and nearly all the other
bishops of England.

In the same year, after the feast of Saint Martin, the king,
with Leofric, Godwin, and Siward attending him, suddenly
proceeded from the city of Gloucester to Worcester, and follow-
ing the advice which they had given him, took away from his
mother all the valuables she had, consisting of gold, silver,
jewels, precious stones, and other things; either because before
he had been made king, or since then, she had given him less
than he required, and had been extremely harsh towards him.

Edmund, bishop of Durham, having departed this life, he
was succeeded by Egelric, Siward being at that time earl of
Northumbria.

In the year 1044, Alword, bishop of London, who, both
before he was bishop, and in the time of his episcopate, was
abbat of the monastery of Evesham, being unable to perform
the duties of the see by reason of his infirmities, wished
to reside at Evesham, but the brethren of that place would by
no means consent thereto. Consequently, taking away most
of the books and ornaments that he had given to that place,
and as some say, some things that other persons had given,
he retired to the monastery of Eamsege, 81 and gave to Saint
Benedict all that he brought ; there he took up his abode,
and dying there in the same year, on the eighth day before
the calends of August, being the fourth day of the week, he
was buried at that place.

At a general synod, which at this time was held at London,
a religious monk of Evesham, who had also been a monk in
the Isle of Man, 82 was chosen abbat of Evesham, and was
ordained on the fourth day before the ides of August, being
the sixth day of the week. In the same year, the noble
matron Gunhilda, the daughter of king Wertgeorn and of
the sister of king Canute, who was left a widow after the

death of earl Hacun and Harold, with her two sons, Hemming
and Turkill, was expelled from England. Proceeding to
Flanders, she resided for some time at a place which is called
Briege, 83 and then went to Denmark.

In the year 1045, Brithwold, hishop of Wiltshire, 84 departed
this life, and was succeeded by Herman, the king's chaplain,
a native of Lorraine. In the same year, Edward, king of the
English, assembled a very strong fleet, at the port of Sandwich,
against Magnus, king of Norway, who was making preparations
to invade England ; but a war being waged against himself by
Sweyn, king of the Danes, it put an end to the expedition.

In the year 1046, on the tenth day before the calends of April,
being the Lord's day, Living, bishop of the Wiccii, 85 and of
Devonshire and Cornwall, died; after whose death the bishopric
of Crediton and Cornwall was immediately given to Leofric, a>
Briton, 86 the king's chancellor ; and Aldred, who was first a
monk of Winchester, and afterwards abbat of Tavistock, re-
ceived the bishopric of the Wiccii. 87 In this year Osgod
Clapa was banished from England. Magnus, king of Norway,
the son of king Olaf the Saint, having put to flight Sweyn
king of the Danes, subdued the country of Denmark.

In the year 1047, the snow fell, in the west of England, in
such vast quantities, that it even broke down the woods. Aid-
win, bishop of Winchester, departed this life, on which Stigand
was raised to the see. Sweyn, king of the Danes, sent am-
bassadors to Edward, king of the English, 88 on which earl God-
win advised the king to send him at least fifty ships, equipped
with soldiers ; but because this advice did not seem good to earl
Leofric and all the people, he was not willing to send him any.
After this, Magnus, king of Norway, attended with a large and
powerful fleet, fought a battle with Sweyn, and, after many
thousands had been slain on both sides, expelled him from Den-
mark ; after which, he reigned over that country as well, and
compelled the Danes to pay him a small tribute, and not long
after, died.

In the year 1048, Sweyn regained possession of Denmark,
and Harold Harf ager, who was the son of Siward, king of Nor-
way, and, on the mother's side, brother of Saint Olaf, and
on the father's side, uncle to king Magnus, returned to Norway,
and shortly after sent ambassadors to Edward, king of the
English, and offered to him, and received in return, assurances
of peace and friendship. On the calends of May, being the
Lord's day, there was a great earthquake at "Worcester, in the
county of the Wiccii, at Derby, and at many other places ; a
mortality among men and animals prevailed throughout. many
of the provinces of England, and fires in the air, commonly
called woodland 89 fires, destroyed towns and crops of standing
corn in the province of Derby, and some other provinces.

In the year 1049, Leo began to reign, 80 the hundred and fifth
pope ; he was the pope who composed the new Gregorian chaunt.
The emperor Henry collected an innumerable force against Bald-
win, earl of Flanders, especially because he had burned his palace
at Nimeguen, and, most beauteous as it was, destroyed it.
Pope Leo took part in this expedition, and a great number of
noblemen and grandees of many nations. Sweyn, king of
the Danes, as the emperor had commanded him, was there also
with his fleet, and on this occasion took the oaths of fealty to
the emperor, who sent also to Edmund, king of the English,
and requested that he would not allow Baldwin to escape, if he
should attempt to do so by sea. In consequence of this, the
king went with a large fleet to the port of Sandwich, and
remained there until the emperor had obtained of Baldwin
every thing he required.

In the meantime, earl Sweyn, the son of earl Godwin and
Gyta, who had formerly left England, (because he was not
allowed to marry Edgiva, abbess of the monastery of Lcomin-
fiter, whom he had debauched), and had gone to Denmark,
returned with eight ships, and, dissembling, declared that he
would, in future, continue faithful to the king. Earl Beorn,
who was the son of the Danish earl Ulph, the uncle of Sweyn,
the son of Spralling, the son of Urse, promised him that he
would obtain his request of the king, and that his earldom
should be restored to him.

Therefore, after earl Baldwin had made peace with the em-
peror, the earls Godwin and Beorn, with the king's permission,
came with forty-two ships to Pevensey ; but the rest of the

fleet he ordered to return home, retaining only a few ships
with him. When word was brought to the king that Osgod
Clapa lay at Ulps with twenty-nine 91 ships, he recalled as
many as he could of the ships that he had sent away ; on
which, Osgod, having fetched away his wife, whom he had
sent to Bruges, returned to Denmark with six ships ; but
the others, going to Essex, returned, carrying off no little
booty from the neighbourhood of Eadulph's Promontory.
But in returning, they were overtaken by a violent storm,
which sank them all, except two, that were taken in the parts
beyond sea, when all were slain who were found on board of
them. While these things were going on, earl Sweyn came
to Pevensey, and with deceitful intent, requested his cousin,
earl Beorn, to go with him to the harbour of Sandwich, and,
as he had promised, reconcile the king to him.

Beorn, trusting in his relationship, and taking with him but
three companions, set out with him ; on which, Sweyn took him
to Bosanham, 92 where his ships were, and putting him on board,
instantly ordered him to be strongly fettered, and kept him
there with him until he came to Dartmouth, where having
slain him, and thrown him into a deep ditch, and covered him
with earth, the six ships left him ; two of which were shortly
afterwards taken by the men of Hastings, who, having slain
those on board of them, carried the ships to Sandwich, and
there presented them to the king. Sweyn, however, flying to
Flanders, with two ships, remained there until Aldred, the
bishop of Worcester, brought him back, and reconciled the king
to him.

In the same year, at the request of the abbat Herimar, a
man of exemplary piety, Saint Leo the pope came to France,
having in his retinue the governor and all the dignitaries of
the city of Rome, and dedicated the monastery of Saint Re-
migius, the apostle of the Franks, which had been built at
Rheims, with the greatest pomp ; and afterwards held a
great synod of archbishops, bishops, and abbats, in that city,
which lasted six days ; to which synod was sent, by Edward,
king of the English, Aldwin, a monk of Ramsey, and abbat
of the monastery of Saint Augustine.

In the year 1050, Machetad, the king of Scotland, sent money

116 ANNALS OF KOGEB DE HOVEDEN. A.U. 1051.

to Rome, for the purpose of distribution. Edsy, archbishop
of Canterbury, departed this life, and was succeeded by Robert,
bishop of London, a Norman by birth. Herman, bishop of
Wiltshire, 93 and Aldred, bishop of Worcester, set out for Rome.

In the year 1051, Alfric, who was also called Putta, arch-
bishop of York, died at Southwell, and was buried at Medes-
hamburgstede, 94 being succeeded by Kinsy, the king's chaplain.
In this year, king Edward freed the English from the heavy tax,
in the thirty-eighth year after his father, king Egelred, had
first ordered it to be paid for the Danish soldiers.

After these things, in the month of September, Eustace the
Elder, earl of Boulogne, who had married the sister of king
Edward, Goda by name, arrived at Canterbury with a few
ships. Here 95 his soldiers, while stupidly and awkwardly in
quest of lodgings for themselves, killed one of the citizens ;
on which, a fellow-citizen of his, being witness of this,
avenged him, by slaying one of the soldiers. On this, the
(.-arl and his men, being greatly enraged, slaughtered a great
number of men and women with their arms, and trod down
children and infants under their horses' hoofs. But when
they saw the citizens running together to resist them, disgrace-
fully taking to flight, they escaped with difficulty, after seven
of their companions had been slain, and fled to king Edward,
who was then at Glavome. 915

Earl Godwin being indignant at such things taking place
in his earldom, and greatly inflamed with anger, in his own
earldom, that is to say, in Kent, Sussex, and Wessex, and
his eldest son Sweyn in his, namely Oxford, Gloucester-
shire, Herefordshire, Somersetshire, and Berkshire, and his
other son Harold in his, namely, the provinces of Essex,
East Anglia, Huntingdon, and Grantebrigge, 97 collected an in-
numerable army; which however did not escape king Edward.
Consequently, sending messengers in all haste to Leofric, earl
of the Mercians, and Siward, earl of Northumbria, he begged
them to make haste and come to him with all they could as-
semble, as he was placed in great jeopardy.

A.D. 1051. FLIGHT OF GODWIN. 117

However, they came at first with a few only ; but -when they
knew how the matter stood, they sent through their earldoms
swift messengers on horseback, and collected a large army. In
like manner, earl Rodulph, son of Goda, sister of king Ed-
ward, collected as many as he could in his earldom. In the,
meantime, Godwin and his sons, after the nativity of Saint
Mary, coming with their forces into the province of Gloucester,
pitched their camp at a place which is called Langeto, and
sending ambassadors to the king at Gloucester, under the threat
of making war, demanded the surrender of earl Eustace, and
his allies as well, both Normans and men of Boulogne, who had
taken possession of the castle on the hill of Dover.

In consequence of this, the king was for the moment greatly
alarmed, and, being afflicted with great anguish, was utterly at a
loss to know what to do ; but when he understood that the army
earls Siward, Leofric, and Eodulph were approaching, he de-
terminedly made answer that he would on no account give up
Eustace and the others who were demanded ; on hearing which,
the messengers returned empty-handed. After their departure
the army entered Gloucester, being prepared for battle with
such hostile and resolutje spirit, that they wished to engage im-
mediately with earl Godwin's army, if the king would permit
them. But, inasmuch as the best men in all England were
assembled together on his side and theirs, it seemed to earl
Leofric and some others, to be the more prudent part not to
begin a battle with their fellow-countrymen ; but they pro-
posed that, exchanging hostages, the king and Godwin should,
on a day named, meet at London for a conference.

This counsel being approved of, and messages interchanged,
and hostages given and received, the earl returned into
Wessex; but the king assembled a more numerous army
from the whole of Mercia and Northumbria, and led it with
him to London. On the other hand, Godwin and his sons
came to South weorc, 98 with a great multitude of the men of
Wessex ; but, as his army had gradually diminished, he
did not dare to come to the conference with the king, but on,
the approach of night, took to flight. Wherefore, next morn-
ing, the king in council, and by the unanimous consent of
his army, pronounced sentence of banishment against him and

with his wife Juthitha, daughter of Baldwin, earl of Flan-
ders, and two other of his sons, Sweyn and Girth, repaired
to Tornege, where his ships were in readiness. Hastily placing
on hoard as much gold and silver and other precious things
as they were able to carry, and embarking with all speed,
they directed their course to Baldwin, earl of Flanders. More-
over, Harold and Leofwin, his sons, going to Bristol, embarked
on board a ship which their brother Sweyn had provided for
himself, and crossed over to Ireland. The king, on account
of the anger which he entertained against her father Godwin,
repudiated queen Edgitha, and sent her ignominiously with a
single attendant to Werewell, where he gave her into the
custody of the abbess.

After these things had thus happened, "William, duke of
the Normans, with a multitude of his subjects, came to Eng-
land, and, with his attendants, was honorably entertained by
king Edward, who afterwards dismissed him, on his return
to Normandy, with great and numerous presents.

In the year 1052, Elfgiva, or Emma, the former queen, and
wife of kings Egelred and Canute, departed this life at Win-
chester, on the second day before the nones of March, and was
buried there. In the same year, Griffin, king of Wales, ra-
vaged a great part of the province of Hereford ; the people of
the province, and a considerable number of Normans, went
out from the castle against him, but, after slaying many of
them, he gained the victory, and carried off with him con-
siderable spoil. This battle was fought on the same day that,
thirteen years before, the Welch had slain Edwin, the brother
of earl Leofric.

Shortly after this, earl Harold and his brother Leofwin re-
turned from Ireland, and entering the mouth of the Severn with
a great number of ships, landed at the confines of Somerset and
Devon, and laid waste many towns and fields in those parts.
Against them a great number of the people of Somerset and
Devon went out, but Harold defeated them, slaying more than
thirty noble thanes of their number, together with many others ;
after which he returned to his ships with the spoil, and then
sailed round Penwithsteort." Upon this, king Edward, with
all expedition, sent forty ships, supplied with provisions and
picked soldiers, to the port of Sandwich, and ordered them to
99 Land's End.

await the approach of earl Godwin, and be on the look-out ;
but, in spite of this, unknown to them all, returning with a
few ships, he landed in Kent, and secretly sending messengers,
enticed to his assistance the people of Kent, and afterwards
the people of Sussex, Essex, Surrey, and all the mariners of
Hastings and of all the parts near the sea-shore, besides some
others ; all these with one voice declared that they were ready
to live or die for him.

When this became known to the king's fleet that lay at the
port of Sandwich, it set out in pursuit of him, on which he
took to flight, and escaped, concealing himself in whatever place
he could. But the king's forces returned to the port of Sand-
wich, and from there repaired to London. On learning
this, earl Godwin returned to the Isle of Wight, and sailed
near the shore until his sons Harold and Leofwin came with
their fleet ; and when they had met they desisted from plunder
and rapine, only, when necessity demanded it, taking pro-
visions for their troops. Enticing to their assistance all the
people they could in the vicinity of the sea-shore and in
other places, and picking up all the mariners they met with,
they steered their course towards the port of Sandwich, their
arrival at which place was reported to king Edward, who
was at this period staying at London. Despatching messen-
gers with all speed, he sent word to all who had not re-
volted from him, that they must come to his assistance with
the greatest haste ; but being very slow in their movements,
they did not come in time.

In the meantime, earl Godwin coming up the Thames with
his fleet against the tide, on the day of the exaltation of the
Holy Cross, being the second day of the week, came to South-
weorc, 1 and waited there until flood- tide. Meanwhile, by
means of messengers, he convened certain of the citizens
of London whom he had previously brought over by various
promises, and caused nearly all of them to wish entirely
as he would have them. After this, all things being arranged
and set in order, on the flood-tide coming, with all speed
they heaved their anchors, and no one on the bridge op-
posing them, sailed up the river close to the south shore. The
land forces also came, and putting themselves in battle
array on the bank of the river, presented a dense and terrible
Southwark.

line of battle ; after which, the fleet turned towards the north
shore, as it was its intention to surround the king's fleet.
For the king had both a fleet and a numerous land army ; but
because both with the king and with Godwin there were very
few who had any spirit (so greatly did almost all the English
abhor fighting against their own kindred and fellow-country-
men), the consequence was, that all the more prudent men on
either side, effecting a reconciliation between the king and the
earl, bade the army lay aside their arms. The following morn-
ing the king held a council, and fully restored to Godwin and
his wife and all his sons, with the exception of Sweyn, their
former honors.

He, being moved with penitence, because, as previously
mentioned, he had slain his cousin Beorn, journeyed from
Flanders to Jerusalem, barefoot, and on his return thence, having
contracted a disease from the excessive cold, died in Lycia.
Edgitha, also, his queen, the daughter of the earl, the king
received with due honor, and restored her to her former dignity.

Peace and concord being thus established, to all the people
they promised good laws, and banished all the Normans who had
instituted unjust ones, and had pronounced unjust judgments,
and had given the king bad counsel against the English. Some
few, however, namely, Robert Le Dragon, and his son-in-law,
Richard the son of Scrobi, Alfred, the king's master of the horse,
Aufrid, surnamed Ceokesfot, and some others whom the king
loved more than the rest, and who had preserved their fidelity
to him and all the people, they allowed to remain in England.
But Robert, the archbishop of Canterbury, William, the bishop
of London, and Ulph, the bishop of Lincoln, with difficulty
escaping with their Normans, crossed the sea ; however, on
account of his virtues, William was shortly after recalled and
reinstated in his bishopric.

Osborn, however, surnamed Pentecost, and his companion,
Hugh, surrendered their castles, and, with the permission of
earl Leofric, passing through his earldom, repaired to Scotland,
where they were received by Machetad, 2 king of the Scots.
In the same year, on the night of the feast of Saint Thomas
the Apostle, there was a wind so strong and violent that it blew
down many churches and houses, and broke numberless trees,
or tore them up by the roots.

A.D. 1055. DEATH OF SIWARD. 121

In the year 1053, the brother of Griffin, king of South
Wales, whose name was Rees, on account of the frequent
depredations which he had committed, was slain by com-
mand of king Edward, at a place called Bulendun, 8 and his
head was brought to the king at Gloucester, on the vigil of
the Epiphany. In the same year, when the second day of
the festival of Easter was being celebrated, a dreadful cala-
mity befel earl Godwin at Winchester, while, as usual, he
was sitting at table with the king. For, being suddenly
attacked by a fatal malady, he sank down on his seat bereft
of speech : on seeing which, his sons, Harold, Tosti, and
Girth, carried him into the king's chamber, hoping that, after
a little while, he would recover from the attack ; but he,
being deprived of all strength, departed this life on the fifth
day after, being the seventeenth day before the calends 01
May, and was buried in the old monastery there. He was
succeeded in the dukedom by his son Harold, whose earldom
was given to Algar, the son of earl Leofric.

In the year 1054, Siward, the valiant earl of Nor-
thumbria, by command of king Edward, invaded Scot-
land, with both an army of horse and a strong fleet, and
fought a battle with Machetad, king of the Scots ; and, after
many thousands of the Scots, and all the Normans, of whom
mention has been made above, were slain, put him to flight,
and gave the crown to Malcolm, son of the king of the Cum-
brians, as king Edward had commanded. But in this battle
his own son, 4 and many of the English and Danes, were
slain.

On the death of Godwin, the abbat of Winchelcomb, Aired,
bishop of Worcester, on the feast of Saint Kenelm, ap-
pointed abbat in his room Godric, the son of Godman, the
king's chaplain. After this, the same bishop was dispatched
on an embassy, with costly presents, to the emperor : by whom,
and Herman, archbishop of Cologne, he was entertained with
great honor, and remained with them a whole year; on
the king's behalf, he also suggested to the emperor to send
ambassadors to Hungary, and bring back his cousin, the
son of king Edmund Ironside, and procure his return to
England,

In the year 1055, Siward, earl of Northumbria, died at

York, and was buried at the monastery of Galmanho, 5 which
he had founded, and his earldom was given to Tosti, the
brother of duke Harold.

A short time after this, a council was held in London, and
king Edward outlawed earl Algar, the son of earl Leofric,
without any blame on his part ; who immediately went to
Ireland, and, having procured eighteen piratical ships, re-
turned, and going to Griffin, king of the Welsh, 6 begged
that he would aid him against king Edward ; on which he,
immediately collecting from the whole of his kingdom a nume-
rous army, requested Algar, with his forces, to meet him and
his army at a place nalned. Having met, they entered the
province of Hereford, for the purpose of laying waste the ter-
ritories of the English ; whereupon the timid duke Rodulph,
nephew of king Edward, collecting an army, met them two
miles from the city of Hereford, on the ninth day before the
calends of November. He ordered the English, contrary to
their usage, to fight on horseback ; but, just when they were
about to engage, the duke, with his Franks and Normans, was
the first to take to flight, which the English seeing, followed
their leader's example.

Nearly the whole of the enemy pursued them, and slew of
them four or five hundred men, and wounded a great number ;
after which, having gained the victory, king Griffin and earl
Algar entered Hereford, and, having slain seven canons who had
defended the doors of the principal church, and having burnt
the monastery (which bishop Athelstan, the true worshipper
of Christ, had built), with all its ornaments, and the relics of
Saint Egelbert, the king and martyr, and of other Saints, and
having slain some of the citizens and taken many prisoners,
and spoiled and burnt the city, they enriched themselves with
a vast amount of plunder.

After this, the king commanded an army to be levied in Eng-
land, and, assembling it at Gloucester, gave the command of it
to the valiant duke Harold, who followed them, and, boldly en-
tering the territories of the Welch, pitched his camp beyond
Straddele. But they, being aware that he was a brave man and
a warlike commander, did not dare to join battle with him,
but fled into South Wales ; on discovering which, he dispatched

thither the greater part of his army, and commanded them,
if necessity demanded it, manfully to resist the enemy. Re-
turning with the rest of his troops to Hereford, he sur-
rounded it with a deep trench, and fortified it with gates
and bars.

In the meantime, messages being interchanged, Griffin,
Algar, and Harold, and those who were with them, met at a
place which is called Billigesleage, 7 and, peace being granted
and received, agreed upon a lasting friendship between them.
This being settled, the fleet of earl Algar proceeded to
Chester, and there awaited the pay that had been promised
it ; but he himself went to the king, and received back from
him his earldom. At the same period, Tremerin, the bishop of
Wales, 8 a religious man, departed this life. He had for a long
time been the coadjutor of Athelstan, bishop of Hereford, after
he himself had become unable to perform the duties of the
bishopric ; for, during a period of thirteen years, he was de-
prived of his eyesight.

Herman, the bishop of the province of Wiltshire, being
annoyed because the king was unwilling to allow the transfer
of the see from the town which is called Ramnebirig 9 to the
abbey of Malmesbury, 10 resigned the bishopric, and, crossing
the sea, assumed the monastic habit at Saint Bertin's, and re-
mained at the monastery there three years.

In the year 1056, the emperor Henry died at Rome, and
was succeeded by his son Henry. Athelstan, the bishop of
Hereford, a man )f great sanctity, departed this life on the
fourth day before the ides of February, at the town which is
called Bosanbrig, and his body being taken to Hereford, was
buried in the church there, which he had built from the
foundation. He was succeeded by Leonegar, the chaplain of
duke Harold, who, in the same year, on the sixteenth day
before the calends of July, was slain at the place which is
called Glastingeberie, 11 together with his clergy, and the sheriff
Agelnoth, and many others, by Griffin, king of the Welsh.
He enjoyed the bishopric eleven weeks and four days.

After his death, the bishopric of Hereford was given in
charge to Aldred, bishop of Worcester, until a bishop should
be appointed. Afterwards, the same bishop, and the nobles

LeoMc and Harold, reconciled Griffin, king of the Welsh, with
king Edward. Earl Agelwin Oddo, 11 * the lover of churches,
the supporter of the poor, the defender of widows and orphans, 12
the guardian of chastity, haying received the mojiastic habit
a month before his death from Aldred, bishop cf Worcester,
died on the second day before the calends of September, at
Deorhirst, but being honorably buried in the monastery of
Pershore, rests there. Algeric, the bishop of Durham, having of
his own accord resigned the bishopric, retired to his own monas-
tery, which is called Burgh, 13 where he was educated, and be-
came a monk, and lived there twelve years. He was succeeded
in the bishopric by his brother, Egelwin, a monk of the
monastery.

In the year 1057, the Clito Edward, son of king Edmund
Ironside, according to the command of his uncle, king Ed-
ward, came to England from Hungary, whither, as previously
mentioned, he had long before been sent into banishment.
For the king had determined to make him heir to the kingdom
in succession to himself; but, shortly after he had arrived,
he departed this life at London. Leofric, the praiseworthy
earl, and of happy memory, son of duke Leofwin, departed
this life at a good old age, at his own town, which is called
Bromleage, 14 on the second day before the calends of Septem-
ber, and was honorably buried at Coventry : which monastery,
among the other good works which he did in his lifetime, he
himself and his wife, the noble countess Godiva, a worshipper
of God, and a devoted lover of Saint Mary ever a virgin, had
built with their patrimonial possessions from the very founda-
tion, and abundantly endowed it with lands, and so enriched
it with various ornaments, that in no monastery throughout
the whole of England could such a quantity of gold, silver,
jewels, and precious stones be found, as was at that period con-
tained therein.

The monasteries, also, of Leominster and Wenlock, and of
Saint John the Baptist, and Saint Werburgh the Virgin, at
Chester, and the church which Eadnoth, bishop of Lincoln,
had built at the famous place which, in English is called

Stow Saint Mary, 15 in Latin the place of Saint Mary, they
enriched with precious ornaments : the monastery of Worces-
ter, also, they endowed with lands, and that of Evesham with
buildings, and enriched it with various ornaments and lands.
The wisdom of this earl, so long as he lived, greatly benefitted
the kings and all the people of England : he was succeeded in
his dignities by his son, Algar.

Hecca, the bishop of the South Saxons, 16 died, and in his
place Egelric, a monk of Christ's church in Canterbury, was
chosen bishop.

In the year 1058, Algar, earl of Mercia, was outlawed by
king Edward the Second, but, by the aid of Griffin, king of
the Welsh, and the assistance of a fleet of the Norwegians,
which unexpectedly came to aid him, he speedily regained
his earldom by force. Aldred, bishop of Worcester, with be-
coming honor, dedicated the church which he had built in
the city of Gloucester, from the foundation, in honor of Peter
the chief of the Apostles ; and afterwards, with the king's
permission, appointed Wulstan, who had been ordained by
himself a monk of Worcester, abbat there. Then, resigning
the charge of the bishopric of Wiltshire, 17 which had been
entrusted to him to govern, and restoring it to Herman, who
has been previously mentioned, he went beyond sea, and set
out for Jerusalem by way of Hungary, a thing that no arch-
bishop or bishop of England is known to have done till then.

In the year 1059, Nicolas, bishop of the city of Florence,
was elected pope, and Benedict was expelled.

In the year 1060, Henry, king of the Franks, departed this
life, and was succeeded by his eldest son, Philip. Duduc,
bishop of Wells, died, and was succeeded by Gisa, the king's
chaplain ; they were both natives of Lorraine. Kinsy, arch-
bishop of York, died at York, on the eleventh day before the
calends of January, and being carried to the monastery which
is called Burgh, was honorably interred there. In his room,
Aldred, bishop of Worcester, was chosen archbishop, on the
Nativity of our Lord ; and the bishopric of Hereford, which
had also been conferred on him by reason of his zeal, was given,
to Walter, a native of Lorraine, the chaplain of queen Edgitha.

In the year 1061, Aldred, archbishop of York, set out for
Rome with earl Tosti, and received the pall from pope Nicolas.

In the meantime, Malcolm, king of the Scots, boldly laid
waste Northumbria, the earldom of his sworn brother, Tosti,
having violated the peace 18 of Saint Cuthbert at Eilond. In
the same year, pope Nicolas departed this life, and Alexander,
being chosen the hundred and forty-ninth pope, succeeded
him.

In the year 1062, "Wulstan, a venerable man, was appointed
bishop of Worcester. Beloved by God, he was a native of the
province of Warwick in the kingdom of Mercia, and sprung of
pious parents, Eastan being the name of his father, and Wulf-
giva of his mother ; he was trained in literature and the eccle-
siastical duties, at the noble monastery which is called Burgh ;
indeed, both his parents were so extremely zealous in the
cause of piety, that long before the end of their lives, making a
vow of chastity, they separated from each other, and rejoiced
to end their days in the holy garb of the monastic order.
The young man, led by their example, his mother in especial
persuading him to it, left the world, and in the same monastery
at Worcester, in which his father before him had served God,
received the monastic habit and ordination from the venerable
Brithege, bishop of that church, by whom he was ordained
both deacon and priest. Immediately, therefore, at the very on-
set, he embraced a life of severe discipline and entirely devoted to
the practice of piety, and speedily became a wonderful example
in watching, fasting, praying, and all kinds of virtues. In con-
sequence of this, by reason of the rigidness of his morals, he was
first chosen for some time master and guardian of the novices ;
after which, on account of his intimate acquaintance with
ecclesiastical duties, he was, by the mandate of the seniors, ap-
pointed both chaunter and treasurer of the church.

Having now gained an opportunity of more freely serving
God, by reason of the guardianship of the church being en-
trusted to him, he gave himself up wholly to a life of contem-
plation; both day and night he devoted himself either to
prayer or to reading the Scriptures, and subdued his body by
fasting two or three days together ; he practised holy vigils to
such an extent, that not only day and night, but even some-
times, a thing that we could hardly have credited, if we had not
heard it from his own mouth, even four days and nights together

18 Probably meaning that he had ravaged some of the lands belonging
to the church of Saint Cuthbert, or the see of Durham.

he would pass without sleep, and thus incur danger through the
brain being almost dried up, had he not hastened to satisfy
nature by a hurried sleep. At length, when, by the power of
nature he was compelled to sleep, he did not refresh his limbs in
slumber by means of bed or bedclothes, but, upon a bench in
the church, supporting his head with the book from which he
was praying or reading, he would recline for a short time.

At length, on the death of Egelwin, prior of the monastery,
this venerable man was chosen by bishop Aldred, prior and
father of the fraternity. This office he discharged most laud-
ably, far from relaxing the severity of his former life, but on
the contrary increasing it in many ways, that he might thereby
afford to the others an example of good living. Afterwards,
in the course of some years, on the election of the abovenamed
Aldred, bishop of Worcester, to the archbishopric of York, the
unanimous consent both of the clergy and of the whole of the
people fixed upon him, king Edward having given them leave
to choose as their bishop whomsoever they pleased.

It so happened that, on this occasion, the legates of the
Apostolic See were present at his election, namely, Armenfred,
bishop of Sion, and another, who, having been sent by pope
Alexander to Edward, king of the English, on ecclesiastical busi-
ness, by the royal orders resided at Worcester throughout nearly
the whole of Lent, waiting there for an answer to be given to
their legateship, when a royal court was held at the ensuing
Easter. These persons, while staying there, were witnesses of
his laudable life, and not only gave their sanction to his election,
but even encouraged in every way both the clergy and the people
to that course, and by their authority confirmed the election.

He however, on the other hand, most obstinately refused,
and exclaimed, that he was not worthy, and even affirmed with
an oath that he would much more willingly assent to his de-
capitation than to the acceptance of so high an office.

When, therefore, he had been often attended by several re-
ligious men on this question, and could not by any means be
persuaded to give his consent, he was at length severely rebuked
for his disobedience and obstinacy, by Wulsy, a recluse, and a
man of God, who was known then to have passed more than
forty years of his life in solitude. Alarmed, also, by a Divine
warning, with the greatest sorrow of heart he was compelled
to give his consent, and having accepted the bishopric, was

consecrated on the Lord's day on which was celebrated the na-
tivity of Saint Mary, 19 and by his life and virtues shone forth
as an illustrious bishop of the see of Worcester. He was con-
secrated, however, by Aldred, the archbishop of York, as at
this period the episcopal duties of Stigand, the archbishop of Can-
terbury, were suspended by our lord the pope, because he had
presumed to accept the archbishopric while Robert, the arch-
bishop, was still living ; however, his canonical profession was
made to Stigand, the abovenamed archbishop of Canterbury, and
not to Aldred, who ordained him.

In addition to this, the archbishop of York, who ordained
him, was by the agency of Stigand, and on account of the
charges made by his followers, ordered to declare before the
king and the nobles of the realm, that he from that time for-
ward did not wish to claim any secular authority or eccle-
siastical rights over him, either because he had been consecrated
by him, or because before the consecration he had been a monk
under him. 20 This ordination took place when he was more
than fifty years of age, it being the twentieth year of the reign
of king Edward, and the fifteenth of the indiction.

In the year 1063, Harold, the valiant duke of Wessex, by
the command of king Edward, after the Nativity of our Lord,
took with him a small body of horse, and set out from Glou-
cester, where the king was then staying, in great haste for
Rhyddlan, 21 for the purpose of slaying Griffin, king of Wales,
on account of the frequent ravages which he committed in the
English territory, and the disgrace which he so frequently
caused to his lord, Edward. But he, on learning beforehand the
approach of Harold, embarked on board ship with his family, and
with some difficulty made his escape. Harold, on finding that
he had fled, set fire to his palace, and, burning his ships with
their equipments, returned on the same day. But, about
the Rogation Days, setting sail with a fleet from Bristol, he
sailed round a great part of the coast of Wales, and was met by
his brother, earl Tosti, with a body of horse, as the king had
commanded, on which, joining their forces, they began to
ravage those districts. The Welch being, consequently, com-
pelled to do so, gave hostages, and made submission, and

promised that they would pay tribute, and outlawed their
own king, Griffin.

In the year 1064, Griffin, king of the Welch, was slain by
his people on the nones of August, and his head, and the
head of his ship with its ornaments, was sent to duke Harold,
who afterwards presented them to king Edward. After this,
king Edward gave the country of the Welch to his brothers,
Blethogent and Rithwalan ; on which, to him, and to duke
Harold, they took the oath of fealty, and that at their com-
mand they would be ready for them both by land and by sea,
and would obediently render all things that had been rendered
before from that land by its former kings.

In the year 1065, the venerable man, Egelwin, bishop of
Durham, raised from his tomb the bones of Saint Oswin, for-
merly king of Bernicia, in the monastery which is near Tyne-
mouth, four hundred and fifteen years after his burial, and
with great honor enclosed them in a shrine.

Harold, the brave duke of "Wessex, in the month of July,
ordered a great building to be erected in the country of the
"Welch, at a place which is called Portaseith, 22 and many
things for eating and drinking to be there collected, that his
lord, king Edward, might be enabled to stay there some time,
for the sake of hunting. But Caradoc, the son of Griffin, king
of the South Welch, whom a few years previously Griffin, king
of the North Welch, had slain on invading his kingdom, came
thither on the day of Saint Bartholomew the Apostle, with
all he could muster, and slew nearly all the workmen to-
gether with those who inspected them, and carried off all
the good things that were collected there.

After this, on the fifth day before the nones of October,
being the second day of the week, the thanes of Northumber-
land, Dunstan, son of Agelnoth, and Gloniern, son of Eardulph,
came from Gamelbarn to York, with two hundred soldiers;
and, in revenge for the shameful death of the Northumbrian
nobles, the thanes Cospatric (whom queen Egitha, for the
sake of her brother Tosti, had ordered to be treacherously
assassinated in the royal palace, on the fourth night of the
Nativity of our Lord), and Gamel, the son of Orm, and
Ulph, the son of Dolphin, whom, in the preceding year, earl
Tosti had treacherously ordered to be slain at York, in his

own chamber, while a treaty of peace existed between them,
as also by reason of the exorbitant tribute which he had
unjustly levied from the whole of Northumbria, on the same
day, first slew his Danish household servants, Amund and
Kavenswearc, whom they stopped in their flight outside of
the walls of the city, and, on the following day, two hundred
men of his court, on the northern side of the river Humber,
and then broke open his treasury, and, carrying off all that
was there, took their departure.

After this, almost all the people of that earldom, assembling
together, met Harold, the duke of Wessex, and the other per-
sons whom, at the request of Tosti, the king had sent to them for
the purpose of making peace, at Northampton. First there, and
afterwards at Oxford, on the day of the Apostles Saint Simon
and Saint Jude, on Harold and many others attempting to
reconcile them to earl Tosti, they all with one voice refused,
and pronounced him an outlaw, together with all those who had
encouraged him to enact unjust laws, and, after the feast of
All Saints, with the aid of earl Edwin, expelled Tosti from
England ; on which, together with his wife, he forthwith re-
paired to Baldwin, earl of Flanders, and passed the winter
at Saint Omer. By the king's command, Morcar was ap-
pointed earl over the people of Northumbria.

After these things, king Edward began gradually to sicken,
and, on the Nativity of our Lord, held his court at London, as
well as he was able, and with great glory caused the church,
which he himself had erected from the foundation, in honor
of Saint Peter the chief of the Apostles, to be dedicated on
the day of the Holy Innocents.

In the year from the incarnation of our Lord 1066, king
Edward the Peaceful, son of king Egelred, that honor to the
English, departed this life at London, in the fourth year of
the indiction, on the vigil of the Epiphany of our Lord, being
the fifth day of the week, after having held the kingly autho-
rity over the Anglo-Saxons twenty-three years, six months,
and twenty-seven days ; and, on the following day, he was
buried with royal honors, and most bitter was the grief of all
then present, and attended with plenteous tears.

After his burial, the viceroy Harold, son of earl Godwin,
whom, before his decease, the king had appointed his succes-
sor, was elevated to the throne by all the chief men of Eng-



A.D. 1066. STORY OF KING EDWARD. 131

land, and was on the same day, with due honor, consecrated
king by Aldred, the archbishop of York.

Respecting the miracles which God, who is ever wonderful
and glorious in his Saints, deigned to work for Saint Edward,
the king and confessor, during his life, a few words are here an-
nexed. On a certain day, while the said king lay prostrate in
prayer before the altar at Westminster, during the celebration
of the mass, he saw in a vision, as though the king of the
Danes had prepared a great ship, for the purpose of a hostile
invasion of England ; but, when he was about to enter from
a boat into the larger ship, -he slipped down between them
and sank, immediately on which his ship went to pieces. On
seeing this miracle, the blessed king Edward smiled, and gave
exceeding thanks to God. On this, the bishop, who was cele-
brating the mass, was afraid that the king had seen something
about him in the celebration thereof to cause his laughter.
Consequently, after the mass was finished, the bishop, having
called together earl Harold and others of the king's nobles
who were then present, anxiously asked the king why he had
smiled during the celebration of the mass ; on which, the king
related to him the vision he had seen ; and the day and hour
being marked, they sent messengers to Denmark, and found
that it had happened to the king of the Danes just as king
Edward had predicted.

Another story relative to the same king. One day, when the
before-named Edward, king of the English, was on a journey,
there met him John, the blessed Apostle and Evangelist, under
the form of a poor man, and begged alms of him. As the king
had no money at hand to give him, he took his ring from off his
finger and gave it to him. Now, on the same day, the same
blessed Evangelist appeared to a certain stranger, as he was
going forth from the holy city of Jerusalem, and said to him,
" Whence comest thou, and whither art thou going?" To
which the stranger made answer," I am from England, and I am
desirous of returning thither." The Apostle then said to him,
' ' Dost thou know Edward, the king of England ? " On which he
made answer, " My lord, I do know him." The Apostle then
said to him, "Take this ring, and carry it to king Edward,
and tell him that the Apostle John sends him back this ring,
which he himself gave to him this day on the road as he
was walking ; and may the good angel of the Lord accompany

s 2



132 ANNALS OF BOGEE DE HOVEDEIT. A.D. 1066.

thee, and grant thee a prosperous journey, Amen." On this,
taking the ring and bidding him farewell, he saw the Apostle
no more.

Now, on the same day, under the guidance of the Lord, to
whom nothing is impossible, this stranger arrived in England,
and, delivering the ring to the king, told him everything that
had happened to him on the road, and how, on that day, he
had returned from Jerusalem. Although this seemed to be
impossible, still, in consequence of the assertions of sojourners
who had been with him at Jerusalem, and who, a long
time after this, returned into England, it was found to be
the truth.

On another occasion it befell the same king Edward, that,
on a certain day, he was taken by the queen and earl
Harold to his treasury, to see a large sum of money which
the queen and earl Harold, without the knowledge of the
king, had collected for his necessities (namely, four pennies
from every hide of land throughout each province of England,
in order that the king might, by the day of the Nativity of
our Lord, purchase clothes for the necessities of the soldiers
and his servants); having entered the treasury, the queen
and earl Harold accompanying him, he beheld the devil seated
upon the money; on which the king said to him, "What
dost thou do here ? " Whereto the devil made answer, " I am
here keeping guard over my money." Upon this, the king said
to him, "I conjure thee by the Father, and the Son, and the
Holy Ghost, tell me how it is that this money is thine." To
this the devil made answer, and said, " Because it has been
unjustly obtained out of the substance of the poor." During
all this, those who attended him were standing astonished
at hearing them talk, but seeing no one except the king ;
who afterwards said to them, "Restore this money to those
from whom it was taken;" and his commands were imme-
diately complied with.

Another story relative to this king. On a certain day of
state, when Edward, the above-named king of the English,
had been crowned at London and was clothed in royal vest-
ments, and was going from his palace towards the monas-
tery, 23 accompanied by a crowd of nobles, archbishops, bishops,
clergy, and people, there sat in the way by which the king was
23 Probably of Westminster.



A.D. 1066. HABOLD LEVIES AIT ABMY. 133

about to pass, a certain leprous man, full of running sores.
Those who went before rebuked him, and, wishing to remove
him thence, bade him hold his peace; on which, the king
said to them, " Allow him to sit there." When the king had
approached him, the leper thus addressed him, " I conjure thee,
by the living God, to carry me on thy shoulders into the
church';" upon which the king, bowing down his head, ordered
the leper to be placed on his shoulders. And it came to pass,
that, when the king moved on, and prayed to the Lord that
He would restore the leper to health, his prayers were heard,
and the leper was made whole from that hour, praising and
blessing the Lord. 24

Harold, as soon as he had begun to reign, proceeded to
abolish all unjust laws and to enact just ones, to become the
zealous patron of churches and monasteries, to venerate and
encourage the bishops, abbats, monks, and clergy, to show
himself pious, humble, and affable to all, and to hold evil-doers
in detestation. For he gave general orders to the dukes, earls,
sheriffs, and thanes, to seize all thieves, robbers, and dis-
turbers of the realm, and himself used every exertion, for the
defence of the country, both by sea and land.

In the same year, on the eighth day before the calends of
May, there appeared a comet, not only in England, but even,
it is said, throughout the whole world. It made its appearance
during seven days, and shone with extreme brightness;
whence the saying ;

In the year one thousand sixty-six
A comet all England's gaze did fix. 21 *

Shortly after this, earl Tosti, returning from Flanders,
landed in the Isle of Wight, and, having compelled the
islanders to find him tribute and provisions, took his depar-
ture and collected plunder near the sea-shore, until he came to
the port of Sandwich. On hearing this, king Harold, who was
then staying at London, ordered a considerable fleet, and an

of England till the reign of queen Anne, the last who practised it.

army of horse, to be levied, and himself made preparations to
set out for the port of Sandwich. When this was reported to
earl Tosti, taking with him some of the mariners who were well
inclined and some who were ill-wishers to him, he retreated,
directing his course to Lindesey, where he burned a great
number of towns, and put many men to death.

On learning this, Edwin, earl of Mercia, and Morcar, earl
of Northumbria, flew to their rescue with an army, and
drove him out of that country. On his departure thence,
he repaired to Malcolm, king of the Scots, and remained with
him all the summer. In the meantime, king Harold came
to the port of Sandwich, and there waited for his fleet, which,
when it had assembled, came to the Isle of Wight, and,
as William, duke of the Normans, the cousin of king Ed-
ward, was making preparations to invade England with
an army, all the summer and autumn he was awaiting his
arrival, and, besides, kept a land force in suitable positions
near the sea-shore. However, on the approach of the nativity
of Saint Mary, their provisions failing, the fleet and the land
force returned home.

After this, Harold Harfager, king of Norway, and brother
of Saint Olaf, came with a very strong fleet, amounting to
more than five hundred large ships, and anchored suddenly at
Tynemouth ; on which earl Tosti met him, as they had
previously arranged, with his fleet, and, making all speed,
they entered the mouth of the river Humber, and then, sailing
against tide up the river Ouse, landed at a place which
is called Kichale. When this became known to king Harold,
he speedily moved his troops towards Northumbria ; but, be-
fore the king could come thither, the two brothers, earls
Edwin and Morcar, with a large army, had had an engagement
with the Norwegians on the northern bank of the river Ouse,
near York, on the vigil of Saint Matthew the Apostle, being
the fourth day of the week ; and had at the first onset, man-
fully fighting, slain great numbers. But, after the battle had
lasted a long time, the English, being unable to sustain the
attack of the Norwegians, and having lost a great number of
their men, turned their backs, and far more were drowned in
the river than slain in the battle.

The Norwegians having gained the victory, and having
taken one hundred and fifty hostages from the city of York,



A.n. 1066. WIIXIAM THE ELDER. 135

returned to their ships, having left there a hundred and fifty
of their own men as hostages. But, on the fifth day after this,
that is to say, on the seventh day before the calends of Octo-
ber, being the second day of the week, Harold, king of the
English, attended by many thousands of soldiers fully armed,
arrived at York ; and, meeting the Norwegians at a place called
Stamford Bridge, slew king Harold Harfager and earl Tosti
with the edge of the sword, together with the greater part of
their army, and, although it was most keenly contested, gained
a complete victory : but to his son Olaf, and to Paul, earl of
the Isle of Orkney, who had" been sent with part of the army
to guard the ships, he gave liberty to return to their country
with twenty ships and the remnant of their army, having
first received from them hostages and oaths for their future
good behaviour.



WILLIAM THE ELDER.

In the meantime, while these things were going on, and the
king supposed that all his enemies were crushed, word was
brought to him that William, duke of Normandy, had arrived
with an innumerable multitude of-faorsemen, slingers, archers,
and foolpaixd that he had levied strong bodies of auxiliaries
from the whole of England, having landed at a place which
is called Penvesca. 25 Upon this, the king with the greatest
haste moved his army towards London ; and although he was
well aware that in the two battles above-mentioned the
bravest men of the whole of England had fallen, and that the
centre of his army had not yet come up, he did not hesitate to
meet the enemy with all possible speed in Sussex; and, at the
distance of nine miles from Hastings, where he had pitched his
camp, on the eleventh day before the calends of November,
being Saturday, and the day of Saint Calixtus the pope and
Martyr, he engaged with them, before the third part of his
army was drawn up ; but, as the English had been drawn
up in a confined spot, many withdrew from his ranks, and
but very few remained with him with undaunted hearts.

Still, from the third hour of the day 26 until nightfall, he
made a most determined resistance against the foe, and

136 ANNALS OF BOGER DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1066.

defended himself so bravely, and with such consummate
valour, that the enemy could hardly get the better of him.
But, alas ! after very great numbers had fallen on both sides,
at twilight he himself fell ; the earls Girth and Leofwine,
his brothers, also fell, and most of the nobles of England ; on
which duke William with his men returned with all speed to
Hastings. The length of Harold's reign was nine months
and as many days.

But in order that the origin may be known of the grounds
on which William invaded England, the circumstances which
had transpired a short time before this period shall be briefly
related.

When the disagreement arose between king Edward and
earl Godwin, as previously mentioned, the earl was driven
into exile with his family from England. Afterwards, on
his endeavouring to effect a reconciliation with the king, in
order that he might be allowed to return to his own country,
the king would by no means consent thereto, unless he first
received hostages as a guarantee of his own security. In
consequence of this, Wulnoth, son of Godwin himself, and
Hacun, son of his son Sweyn, were given as hostages, and
sent to Normandy in charge of duke William the Bastard,
the son of Robert, son of Richard, his 27 mother's brother.
Sometime after this, when earl Godwin was dead, his son,
Harold, asked leave of the king to go to Normandy, and obtain
the liberty of his brother and nephew, who were kept there
as hostages, and to bring them back with him to their own
country ; on which the king made answer: "By me this shall
not be done ; but that I may not appear to wish to prevent
you, I permit you to go wherever you like, and to try what you
can effect : still I have a presentiment that your efforts will
end in nothing but injury to the whole kingdom of England
and disgrace to yourself; for I know that the duke is not so
devoid of intelligence as to be willing on any account to en-
trust them to you, if he does not foresee some great profit
to accrue therefrom to himself."

However, Harold embarked on board of a ship, which, vith

all on board of it, being driven by a violent tempest into u

river of Ponthieu, which is called the Maia, according to thf>

custom of the place he was claimed as a captive by the lord

37 King Edward the Confessor.



A.D. 1066. HAROLD ASSENTS TO WTLLIAM's WISHES. 137

of that district. Harold, on being thrown into prison,
having, however, bribed one of the common people with the
promise of a reward, secretly gave him directions to inform the
duke of Normandy of what had befallen him. On hearing this,
William immediately sent messengers in all haste, and told the
lord of Ponthieu that Harold and his people must be sent to him
immediately, free from all harm, if he wished to enjoy his
future friendship in the same degree as hitherto ; he, how-
ever, being unwilling to send him, once more received a
command from William that he must send Harold, otherwise
he would find most assuredly, that "William, duke of Nor-
mandy, would instantly come armed to Ponthieu for the pur-
pose of taking him away with all his property, even to the
utmost farthing.

Alarmed by these threats, he sent Harold with his com-
panions, on which he was most honorably received by duke
William, who, on hearing why he had left his country, made
answer that he would be successful if it rested with him. 28 He,
therefore, kept Harold with him for some days, and showed
himself very kind and courteous towards him, in order that by
such conduct he might gain his feelings in support of his own
objects. At length he disclosed to him what his designs were,
and stated that king Edward once, when in his youthful days,
he was staying in Normandy, with himself then a youth, pro-
mised him upon his oath, that if he should become king of Eng-
land, he would grant to him, in succession to himself, the here-
ditary right to the kingdom; and, in addition to this, he
said : "And if you will engage to aid me in this matter, and to
procure for me the castle of Dover, with the well of water there,
and will give your sister in marriage to one of my nobles, and
promise to send her to me at the time that shall be agreed on by
us, and also, to accept my daughter in marriage, then you
shall both receive your nephew safe and sound immediately,
and, your brother, when I come to reign in England ; and if,
by your aid, I am firmly established in that kingdom, I pro-
mise that every thing that in reason you shall ask of me, you
shall obtain."

Harold was sensible of danger either way, and did not
see how he was to escape if he did not acquiesce in the
wishes of William in every respect : he, therefore, gave his as-

28 " Si in ipso non remaneret," hardly seems to be a correct reading
here.



138 ANNALS OF BOGEK DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1066.

sent. But in addition to this, William, in order that everything
might be definitively settled, having brought some relics of
saints, led Harold to attest, by taking an oath upon them, that
he would in deed fulfil everything that had been agreed upon
between them.

These matters being concluded, Harold received his nephew
and returned to his country ; but when, in answer to the
king's enquiries, he informed him of what had happened and
what he had done, he answered, " Did I not tell you that I
knew duke William well, and that, in consequence of your
journey, great evils might result to this kingdom ? I foresee
that, by this conduct of yours, great misfortunes will befall our
country ; and I only pray that Divine Providence will grant
that they come not in my day."

Shortly after, king Edward departed this life, and, as he
hj,d_app^in^d_^reviously_to_his death^ Harold_8uecfieded^^m
inliheKingdqm,, "^nTHsT^ukfe-William "sent him word, that
although^ violating his oath, he had not observed his promise
in other respects, still, if he would marry his daughter he
would put up with what he had done, but, if not, he would
without doubt assert his right to the promised succession to the
kingdom by force of arms.

But Harold would neither say that he was ready to comply
with the one alternative, nor that he feared the other ; at
which, William being indignant, was inspired with great hopes
of conquering England by reason of this unjust conduct of
Harold. Having, therefore, prepared a considerable fleet, he
sailed for England, and a severe engagement taking place,
Harold was slain in battle, and William being victorious, ob-
tained the kingdom.

Some of the Franks still give an account of 29 the circum-
stances of this battle who were there present. But although
there were various chances of success on the one side and the
other, still, there was such great slaughter and disorder
caused by the Normans, that the victory which they gained
must without doubt be ascribed to the judgment of God, who
by punishing the crime of perjury shows that he is a God who
abhors unrighteousness.

On hearing of the death of king Harold, the earls Edwin

29 " Adlmc" can hardly mean " at the present day," in allusion to oral
testimony ; as our author lived nearly a hundred years after the time of
William the Conqueror.



A D 1067. WILLIAM KETTTKNS TO NOBMANDY. 139

and Morcar, who with their men had withdrawn from the
hattle, came to London, and taking their sister, queen Ald-
githa, sent her to the city of Chester. Aldred, archbishop of
York, and these earls, together with the citizens of London, and
the mariners, were desirous to make the Clito Edgar, grandson of
king Edmund Ironside, king, and promised that they would
fight for him. But while many were making preparations to
go forth to battle, the earls withdrew their aid from them, and
returned home with their forces.

In the meanwhile duke William laid waste the provinces of
Sussex, Kent, Southampton, Surrey, Middlesex, and Hereford ;
and did not cease burning towns and slaying men, till he
came to the city which is called Beorcharn. 30 Here Aldred,
the archbishop, Wulstan, bishop of Worcester, Walter, bishop
of Hereford, the Clito Edgar, earls Edwin and Morcar, and
five of the nobles of London, with many others came to
him, and, giving hostages, made submission, and took the
oaths of fealty to him. He also made a treaty with them, but,
in spite of it, allowed his army to burn the towns, and plun-
der them.

On the approach of the festival of the Nativity of our Lord,
be marched with all his army to London, that he might be
crowned there ; and because Stigand, the primate of the whole
of England, was charged with not having canonically received
the pall, on the day of the Nativity, which in that year fell
on the second day of the week, he was consecrated with due
honor at Westminster, by Aldred, the archbishop of York ; but
first, as the same archbishop requested him to do, before the
altar of Saint Peter the Apostle, in the presence of the clergy
and the people, he promised on oath, that he would be ready to
defend the holy churches of God and their rulers, and that
he would justly and with royal foresight rule over all the
people subject to him, enact and observe just laws, and utterly
discountenance rapine and unjust judgments.

In the year 1067, on the approach of Lent, king William
returned to Normandy, taking with him Stigand, archbishop
of Canterbury, Agehioth, abbat of Glastonbury, the Clito
Edgar, the earls Edwin and Morcar, Walter, a noble earl, son
of earl Siward, Agelnoth, a native of Canterbury, and many

others of the chief men of England, also his brother Odo,
bishop of Bayeux, and William FitzOsbern, whom he had
made earl of the province of Hereford ; and leaving garrisons
in England, he ordered the fortresses throughout the country
to be strengthened.

In this year, "Wulsy, bishop of Dorchester, departed this
life at "Winchester, but was buried at Dorchester.

At this period, there was a certain very powerful thane, Edric
surnamed "the Woodsman," 31 son of Alfric, the brother of Edric
Streona, whose lands, because he disdained to surrender to the
king, the men of the castle at Hereford, and Kichard the son
of Scrob, frequently laid waste ; but as often as they attacked
him, they lost many of their knights and esquires. There-
fore, having called to his aid the kings of the Welch, namely
Bleothgent and Biward, about the time of the Assumption of
Saint Mary, the said Edric laid waste the province of Here-
ford, as far as the bridge over the river Lug, 32 and carried off a
great quantity of plunder.

Afterwards, on the approach of winter, king William re-
turned to England from Normandy, and imposed on the English
an intolerable tribute, and then, going into Devonshire, hos-
tilely attacked the city of Exeter, which the citizens and some
English thanes held against him ; on which he laid siege to
it, and speedily took it by storm. However, the countess
Githa, the mother of Harold king of England, and sister of
Sweyn king of Denmark, flying with many others from the
city made her escape and went to Flanders ; but the citizens
with assurances of friendship submitted to the king.

In the year 1068, there were two popes at Kome, namely,
the bishop of Parma, who was expelled, and the bishop of
Lucca, who continued to be pope.

After Easter, the countess Matilda came from Normandy to
England, and on the day of Pentecost, Aldred, archbishop of
York, consecrated her queen. After this, Marleswein and
Cospatric, and the other nobles of Northumbria, in order to
avoid the king's severity, and fearing lest like some others
they might be placed in confinement, taking with them the
Clito Edgar, his mother Agatha, and his two sisters Margaret
and Christiana, went by ship to Scotland ; and, with the per-

He is more generally called Edric the Outlaw.

mission of king Malcolm, passed the winter there. On this,
king William came with his army to Nottingham, and having
strengthened the castle, proceeded to York, and fortifying the
two castles there, placed in them five hundred soldiers, giving
orders for the castles to be strengthened in the city of Lincoln
and other places.

While these things were going on, the sons of king Harold,
Godwin and Edmund the Great, returning from Ireland landed
in Somersetshire; where being met by Eadnoth, who had been
master of the stables 33 to king Harold, with some troops, a battle
was fought, in which he, with many others, was slain. Having
gained the day, they collected considerable spoil in Devonshire
and Cornwall, and then returned to Ireland.

In the year 1069, being the third year of his reign, king
William sent earl Robert Cummin against the Northumbrians
of the country north of the Tyne ; for they had all united
in one determination, not to submit to the rule of a foreigner,
and had resolved either to slay him, or else, all of them, to
fall by the edge of the sword. On his approach, Egelwin,
bishop of Durham, met him, and warned him to be on his
guard against treachery ; but he, thinking that no one dared
this, despised the warning, and, entering Durham with a
large body of soldiers, allowed his men to act with hostility
in all quarters, even to slaying some peasants belonging
to the church ; still, he was received by the bishop with all
kindness and honor. But the Northumbrians hastening on-
ward all night, at daybreak broke through the gates with
the greatest violence, and slew the followers of the earl in
every direction, they being quite unprepared for the attack.
The contest was waged most fiercely, the soldiers being struck
down in the houses and streets, and the combatants attacked
the house of the bishop in which the earl was entertained ;
but finding that they could not endure the darts of those who
defended it, they burned the house together with those who
were therein. So great was the multitude of the slain, that
nearly every spot in the city was filled with blood, and out of
seven hundred men only one escaped. This slaughter took
place on the fifth day before the calends of February, being
the fourth day of the week.

142 ANNALS OF BOGER DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1069.

In this year, shortly before the nativity of Saint Mary, the
sons of Sweyn, king of Denmark, Harold, Canute, and their
uncle earl Osborn, came from Denmark with two hundred and
forty ships, and landed at the mouth of the river Humber.
Here they were met by the Clito Edgar, earls Aide and Marle-
swein, and many others, with a fleet which they had assembled;
earl Cospatric also came with all the forces of the Northum-
brians, and with one accord they determined to oppose the
Normans. Being greatly distressed at their approach, Aldred,
archbishop of York, was attacked with a severe illness and
ended his life, as he had requested of God, in the tenth year
of his archiepiscopate, on the third day before the ides of
September, being the sixth day of the week ; he was buried
in the church of Saint Peter, on the eighth day after, being
Saturday, the thirteenth day before the calends of October.

The Normans, who garrisoned the castles, fearing lest the
houses which were in their vicinity, might be used by the
Danes for the purpose of filling up the fosse, began to set
them on fire ; and the flames, increasing, raged throughout all
the city, and together with it, burned the monastery of Saint
Peter. But the Divine vengeance most speedily exacted a
heavy retribution at their hands ; for, before the whole city
was destroyed, a Danish fleet came on the second day of the
week to the aid of the besiegers, and the Danes making an
attack upon the castles on the one side, and the Northumbrians
on the other, stormed them on the same day ; more than three
thousand of the Normans being slain, the Danes sparing the
lives of William de Malet, who was then sheriff of the pro-
vince, with his wife and two children, and of Gilbert de Ghent
with a few others, repaired to their ships with their innumer-
able forces, and the Northumbrians returned home.

When king William was informed of this, being greatly
enraged, he swore that he would pierce the whole of the
Northumbrians with a single spear, and shortly afterwards,
having assembled an army hastened with feelings of ex-
treme irritation to Northumbria, and did not cease throughout
the whole winter to ravage it, slay the inhabitants, and com-
mit many other acts of devastation.

In the meantime, sending a message to Osborn, the
Danish earl, he promised that he would privately present him



A.D. 1069. FLIGHT OF THE BISHOP OF DURHAM. 143

with no small sum of money, and give his army free licence to
seize provisions in the neighbourhood of the sea-shore, upon
condition that, after the close of winter, they should depart,
without any further hostilities. To these propositions Osborn,
being greedy for gold and silver, to his great disgrace, as-
sented. While the Normans, in the preceding year, were
laying waste England, throughout Northumbria and some other
provinces, but in the present and succeeding year, throughout
almost the whole of England, but especially Northumbria and the
provinces adjoining to it, a famine prevailed to such a degree,
that, compelled by hunger, men ate human flesh, and that of
horses, dogs, and cats, and whatever was repulsive to notions
of civilization ; some persons went so far as to sell themselves
into perpetual slavery, provided only they could in some way
or other support a miserable existence ; some departing from
their native country into exile, breathed forth their exhausted
spirits in the midst of the journey.

It was dreadful to behold human corpses rotting in the
houses, streets, and high roads, and as they reeked with putre-
faction, swarming with worms, and sending forth a horrid
stenoh ; for all the people having been cut off, either with the
sword or famine, or else having through hunger left their
native country, there were not sufficient left to inter them.
Thus, during a period of nine years, did the land, deprived of
its cultivators, extend far and wide a mere dreary waste. Be-
tween York and Durham there was not one inhabited town ;
the dens of wild beasts and robbers, to the great terror of the
traveller, were alone to be seen.

While the king was doing these things in the neighbour-
hood of York, Egelwin, bishop of Durham, and the chiefs of the
people, being fearful that, on account of the death of the earl 35
at Durham and the slaughter of the Normans at York, the
sword of the king would involve both innocent and guilty in a
like destruction, unanimously disinterred the holy and incor-
ruptible body of the blessed father Cuthbert and took to flight,
on the third day before the ides of December, being the sixth
day of the week. They first rested at Girwine, 36 next at
Bethlingtun, 37 the third time at Tughale, 38 and the fourth at

35 Robert Cummin. 36 Jarrow, in Durham.

Ealande. Here, towards nightfall, their further progress was
impeded by the sea being at high water, when lo ! suddenly
withdrawing, it left them free access, so that when they has-
tened on, the waves of the ocean followed in the rear, at a
similar pace, and when they sometimes moved more slowly,
the waves did not overtake them by speeding on at a faster
pace, but, as soon as they had touched the shore, behold ! the
sea flowed back again and covered all the sands as before.

In the meantime, the king's army, dispersing in all direc-
tions, between the rivers Tees and Tyne, found nothing but
deserted houses, and a dreary solitude on every side ; the in-
habitants having either sought safety in flight, or concealed
themselves in the woods and among the precipices of the
hills. At this period also, the church of Saint Paul the
Apostle, at Girwine, was destroyed by fire. The church of
Durham was deprived of all its guardians and all ecclesiastical
care, and had become like a desert, as the Scripture says, a
refuge for the poor, the sick, and the feeble. Those who
were unable to take to flight, turning aside thither, sank there
under the influence of famine and disease. The resemblance
of the cross, which was the only one of the church ornaments
remaining there, (as on account of its large size it could not be
easily removed by them in their haste) was robbed of its gold
and silver, which were torn off by the Normans.

On this, the king, who was not far off, hearing of the de-
serted state of the church, and the spoliation of the crucifix,
was very indignant, and gave orders for those to be sought for
who had been guilty of it. Shortly after, he happened to meet
these very persons, and on seeing them turn out of the pub-
lic road, immediately felt convinced that these men were
conscious of having committed some misdeed ; whereon, being
seized, they immediately made discovery of the gold and silver
which they had taken from off the crucifix. On this, he imme-
diately sent them for judgment to the bishop and those who
were with him, who were now returning from their flight ;
but they, acquitting them of the charge, let them escape
with impunity. For, upon the approach of spring, the king
having returned to the country south of the Humber, bishop
Egelwin, after having, with all his people, passed three months
and some days at Ealande, returned to the church of Durham,
with the treasure of the holy body of Saint Cuthbert.



A.D. 1070. RAVAGES OF MALCOLM. 145

In the year 1070, at the season of Lent, by the advice of
William, earl of Hereford, and some others, king William or-
dered his followers to search the monasteries throughout the
whole of England ; and the money which, on account of his
severity and extortion, the wealthier English had deposited
there, he ordered to be taken from them.

Bishop Egelwin, having returned from flight, as already
mentioned, now meditated in his mind a perpetual exile.
For, seeing the affairs of the English in a state of confusion on
every side, and fearing that the sway of a foreign nation, to
whose language and manners he was a stranger, would press
with severity upon himself, he determined to resign his bishop-
ric, and to provide for himself, as he best might, in a foreign
land. Having, therefore, provided a ship, and put all neces-
saries on board, he was waiting for a fair wind in the harbour
of Wearmouth.

At the same time there were some other ships there ; on
board of which were the Clito Edgar with his mother Agatha,
and his two sisters, Margaret and Christiana, Siward Barn,
Marleswein, and Elfwin, son of Norman, and many besides;
who, after the attack on the castles at York, on the return
home of the Danes, dreading the vengeance of the king for
having aided them, were preparing to fly to Scotland and
waiting for a fair passage thither.

At this period, a countless multitude of Scots, under the
command of king Malcolm, passing through Cumberland, and
making their way towards the east, fiercely laid waste the
whole of Teesdale 39 and its neighbourhood, far and wide.
Having come to a place which, in the English language, is
called Hundredesfelde, and in the Latin " Centum Fontes "
(the hundred springs}, and having slain there some of the En-
glish nobles, the king, retaining with him part of his army,
sent home the other part, with an infinite amount of spoil, by
the road by which they had come. In doing this, his crafty
design was, that the wretched inhabitants who, in their fear of
the enemy, had for safety concealed themselves and their pro-
perty in whatever hiding-places they could find, might sup-
pose that the whole of the enemy's forces had departed, and
that he might suddenly come upon them after they had,
with a feeling of security, returned to their towns and homes ;

which, accordingly, happened to be the case. For, having laid
waste part of Cleveland, he suddenly ravaged Heorternisse,
and thence making a fierce incursion upon the lands of Saint
Cuthbert, 40 deprived all of the whole of their property, and
some even of their lives.

In addition to this, he consumed the church of Saint Peter
the Apostle, at Wearmouth, with flames which were kindled by
his men in his own presence ; other churches also he burned
to the ground, together with those who had taken refuge in
them. While riding near the banks of the river, and from
an elevated spot looking down upon the cruelties inflicted by
his men upon the wretched English, and satiating his mind
and his eyes with this sight of horror, word was brought to
him that the Clito Edgar and his sisters, comely young women
of royal blood, with many others, very wealthy fugitives from
their country, had taken refuge in that harbour. On this,
after interchanging courtesies with them, he kindly addressed
them when they came, and gave to them and all their atten-
dants, with the strongest assurances of peace, an asylum in
his dominions for as long a period as they should think fit.
Amid these depredations inflicted by the Scots, earl Cospatric,
who, as already mentioned, had purchased the earldom of
Northumbria of king William for a sum of money, having
obtained the aid of some active allies, ravaged Cumberland
with dreadful havoc ; and then, having laid waste the country
with fire and sword, returned with a large quantity of
spoil, and shut himself and his followers within the strong
fortifications of Bebbanburgh ; 41 whence frequently sallying
forth, he greatly weakened the enemy's strength. At this
period Cumberland was subject to king Malcolm; not by right-
ful possession, but in consequence of having been subjugated
by force.

Malcolm, on hearing what Cospatric had done (while he
was still looking at the church of Saint Peter burning amid
the flames kindled by his own men), could hardly contain him-
self for anger, and commanded his men no longer to spare
any individual of the English nation, but either to strike them
to the earth and slay them, or, making them prisoners, carry
them off, doomed to the yoke of perpetual slavery. The
troops having received this sanction, it was dreadful even to

witness the cruelties they were guilty of towards the English.
Some aged men and women were decapitated with the sword ;
others, like swine intended for food, were pierced through and
through with lances ; infants were torn from the breasts of
their mothers, thrown aloft into the air. and on falling, re-
ceived upon the points of lances, sharp weapons being thickly
planted in the ground.

The Scots, more savage than wild beasts, took delight in these
cruelties, as though a spectacle of games; and thus did the
age of innocence, destined to attain heaven, breathe its last,
suspended between heaven -and earth. But the young men
and young women, and whoever besides seemed adapted for
toil and labour, were driven away in fetters in front of the
enemy, to endure a perpetual exile in captivity as servants
and handmaids. Some of these, while running before those who
drove them on, became fatigued to a degree beyond what their
strength could endure, and, as they sank to the ground on the
spot, the same was the place of their fall and of their death.
While beholding these scenes, Malcolm was moved to compas-
sion by no tears, no groans of the wretched creatures ; but,
on the contrary, gave orders that they should be perseveringly
driven onward in their course.

In consequence of this. Scotland became filled with men-
servants and maid-servants of English parentage ; so much so,
that even at the present day not only not even the smallest
village, but not even the humblest house is to be found with-
out them.

After the return of Malcolm to Scotland, bishop Egelwin
having set sail with the view of proceeding to Cologne, a con-
trary wind arose and drove him back upon the coast of Scotland,
which also, after a speedy passage, brought thither the Clito
Edgar with his above-named companions. On this, king Mal-
colm, with the full consent of his relations, married Mar-
garet, the sister of Edgar, a woman ennobled by her royal
birth, but much more ennobled by her wisdom and piety,
through whose zeal and untiling efforts the king himself,
laying aside his barbarian manners, became more virtuous and
more civilized. By her he had six sons Edward, Edmund,
king Edgar, Ethelred, king Alexander, king David, and two
daughters, Matilda, queen of the English, and Mary, who
became the wife of Eustace, earl of Boulogne.

In the same year, a great synod was held at Winchester, on
the octave of Easter, by command of king William, who was
there present; it was also sanctioned by our lord Alex-
ander, the pope, who gave the authority of the Apostolic See
thereto, through his legates, Hcrmenfred, bishop of Sion, and
the cardinal priests, John and Peter. At this synod Sti-
gand, archbishop of Canterbury, was deprived of his arch-
bishopric on three grounds, namely ; because he had wrong-
fully held the bishopric of Winchester together with the
archbishopric ; because, in the lifetime of archbishop Robert,
he had not only held the archbishopric, but even for some
time, at the celebration of the mass, had made use of his pall
which remained at Canterbury, when he himself had been
violently and unjustly expelled from England ; and because he
had received the pall from Benedict, who had been excom-
municated by the holy Church of Home, for having gained
the papacy by means of bribery. His brother Agelmar, the
bishop of East Anglia, 42 was also deprived there, as were also
some abbats ; all which was done by the agency of the king,
in order that as many of the English as possible might be
deprived of their honors ; in whose place he might appoint
persons of his own nation, for the purpose of strengthening
his possession of the kingdom which he had recently acquired.

For this reason, also, he deprived of their honors certain
bishops and abbats, whom, as no evident reason existed, neither
synods nor secular laws condemned ; and, placing them in con-
finement, kept them there to the end of their lives, being
merely influenced, as already mentioned, by suspicion on ac-
count of the kingdom he had newly acquired.

At this synod, also, while the rest, being sensible of the
king's feelings, were afraid lest they should be deprived of
their dignities, the venerable man, Wulstan, bishop of Wor-
cester, resolutely demanded restoration of a considerable quan-
tity of property belonging to his see which had been retained
in his possession by archbishop Aldred, when he was removed
from the see of Worcester to that of York, and which, after
his death, had come into the king's hands ; and both asked
for justice to be done by those who presided over the synod,
and demanded it of the king. But the church of York, as it
then had no pastor to speak for it, was dumb ; judgment was
42 Bishop of Helmhatn, in Norfolk.

therefore given that the claim should remain in its present
state until an archbishop was appointed, who might defend his
church, and there would be a person to make answer to his
charge ; so that, after the charges and answers had been con-
sidered, judgment might be given with more fairness and cer-
tainty. Accordingly, on the present occasion, the claim stood
over for a time.

On the day of Pentecost, in this year, the king, being then
at Windsor, gave the archbishopric of the church of York to
Thomas, a venerable canon .of Bayeux, and the bishopric of
Winchester to Valceline, his own chaplain : and, by his com-
mand, on the following day, Armenfred, the above-named
bishop of Sion, held a synod, John and Peter, the cardinals
before-mentioned, having returned to Rome.

At this synod Agelric, bishop of the South Saxons, 43 was
degraded in an uncanonical manner ; and shortly after, for no
fault on his part, the king placed him in confinement at
Mearlesberge. 44 A considerable number of abbats were also
deposed ; after whose deposition, the king gave to his chaplains
Arfract, the bishopric of East Anglia, 45 and to Stigand, that
of the South Saxons ; to some of the Norman monks he also
gave abbeys ; and, as the archbishop of Canterbury had been
deposed, and the archbishop of York had recently died, by the
king's command Valceline was ordained on the eighth day
after Pentecost by the same Armenfred, bishop of Sion, the
legate of the Apostolic See.

On the approach of the feast of Saint John the Baptist, earl
Osborn departed for Denmark with the fleet that had lain
in the river Humber during the winter, but his brother,
Sweyn, outlawed him on account of the money, which, con-
trary to the wishes of the Danes, he had received from king
William. At this period the most valiant man, Edric, sur-
named the Woodsman, 46 was reconciled to king William.
After this, the king summoned from Normandy Lanfranc, the
abbat of Caen, a Lombard by birth, a man of the greatest
learning in every respect, well skilled in all the liberal arts
and in the knowledge of both divine and secular literature,
and most prudent in counsel and in the management of tem-
poral matters, and, on the day of the Assumption of Saint

Mary, appointed him archbishop of Canterbury, and, at the
feast of Saint John the Baptist, being the Lord's Day, had him
consecrated at Canterbury. His consecration was performed
by Giso, bishop of Wells, and Walter, bishop of Hereford, who
had both been ordained at Rome by pope Nicolas, at the time
when Aldred, archbishop of York, received his pall. For
these bishops had avoided receiving ordination from Stigand,
who then held the see of Canterbury, as they knew that he had
received the pall in an uncanonical manner. Herman, bishop
of Salisbury, with some others, was also present at his con-
secration, shortly after which, Lanfranc consecrated Thomas,
archbishop of York.

These matters completed, the claim of the venerable Wul-
stan, bishop of Worcester, was again considered, Thomas
having been now consecrated archbishop, to speak for the
church of York ; and, a synod being held at a place which
is called Pedreda, 47 before the king and Lanfranc, archbishop
of Canterbury, and the bishops, abbats, earls, and principal
men of England, by the aid of the grace of God, the matter
was there concluded, although Thomas, the archbishop of York,
and his supporters, used every possible device, though far
from being based upon the truth, to lower the church of Wor-
cester, and to subject her to the church of York, and strove in
every way to make her a dependant thereof. However, by the
just judgment of God, and the most positive evidence of writings
much defaced and almost worn to pieces, Wulstan, the man
of God, not only regained the possessions that he had claimed
and demanded, but, also, by the gift of God and the con-
cession of the king, obtained that extent of liberty which had
been bestowed upon her by the first founders king Ethelred
and Saint Hosher, earl of the Wiccii, and by Cenred, Ethel-
bald, Offa, Saint Kenulph the father of Kenelm the Martyr,
and their successors after them, and those who reigned over
the whole kingdom of England, namely, Edward the Elder,
Ethelstan, Edmund, Edred, Edgar father of king Edward the
Martyr, and those who had succeeded them.

In the year from the incarnation of our Lord, 1071, Lan-
franc and Thomas went to Rome, and received the pall from
pope Alexander. The earls Edwin and Morcar, finding that
king William wished to place them in confinement, secretly fled
47 Petherton, in Somersetshire.

from his court, and for some time remained in open rebellion
against him. However, on finding that their attempts were
not crowned with success, Edwin determined to go to Malcolm,
king of the Scots, but, being treacherously attacked on the road
by his own people, was slain. Morcar and Hereward, however,
a man of the greatest bravery, with many others, repaired by ship
to tho Isle of Ely, intending to winter there ; whither Egelwin,
bishop of Durham, and Siward, surnamed Barn, returning by
sea from Scotland, also came. But, when the king heard of this,
with the help of his sailors, he cut them off from all exit on the
eastern side of the island, and, on the western side* ordered
a bridge to be constructed two miles in length. On seeing
that they were thus enclosed, they ceased making resistance,
and all, with the exception of Hereward and a few who
made their escape through the fens, surrendered to the king :
who shortly afterwards placed bishop Egelwin in confinement
at Abingdon, where the same winter he ended his life : but as to
Earl Morcar and the rest, he distributed a part of them in vari-
ous places of confinement throughout England, and having first
deprived them of their hands or their eyes, let go the rest. The
king then appointed Walcher, a member of the church of Liege,
to the bishopric of Durham, and he was accordingly consecrated
at Winchester. He had come to this country on the king's
invitation, being a person of illustrious family, graceful man-
ners, and endowed with the recommendations of divine and
secular knowledge. Eilaf, one of the king's household ser-
vants, very high in office, together with other men of rank,
escorted him to York, where earl Cospatric met him by the
king's command, and escorted the bishop as far as Durham ; he
arrived at the church of his see at the period of Mid-Lent.

In the year 1072, after the Assumption of Saint Mary,
king William, having in his train Edric, surnamed the Woods-
man, 48 set out for Scotland with a fleet and an army of horse, for
the purpose of subjugating it ; for Malcolm, king of the Scots,
had greatly offended him in having, as already mentioned, so
dreadfully ravaged his territories the year before. But when
the king of the English had entered Scotland, king Malcolm
met him at a place which is called Abernithie, and did homage
to him. 48 On his return thence, king William deprived earl
Cospatric of his dignity, making it a charge against him that
48 He is also called in history the Outlaw, and the Forester.



152 AXXALS OF BOGER DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1072.

he had counselled and aided those who had slain the earl 49 at
Durham, and had taken part with the enemy when the
Normans were slain at York. After his deprivation, Wai-
theof was raised to the earldom, to which he was entitled both
on his father's and his mother's side, being the son of earl Siward,
by Elfrida, the daughter of Ealdred, who was formerly earl.

At this period, that is to say, when the king was returning
from Scotland, he built a castle at Durham, where the bishop
and his people might enjoy security from the incursions of the
enemy ; and, as some of the Normans disbelieved that the
blessed Cuthbert either was a Saint, or that his body was kept
there, at the feast of All Saints, while the bishop was cele-
brating the mass, the king ordered his two chaplains to enter
the sanctuary, and to open the tomb and examine, both by
seeing and touching, whether the holy body was deposited there.
For the king had previously declared that, if it was not there,
all the elders should be put to death. Upon this, all being in
great consternation, the chaplains were just about to perform his
commands. Now at this period, the cold weather was very
severe ; but, in the meantime, the king began to feel overpowered
by an intolerable heat, and to perspire most copiously, and to be
attacked with an excessive trembling; so, at once sending to his
chaplains, he ordered them not to presume to touch the tomb.

Immediately after this he mounted his horse, and ceased
not to ride at its utmost speed till he reached the river Tees.
From that time forward he held this Saint in the highest esteem,
and confirmed the more favored laws and customs of that church,
which it had received in time past, for perpetual observance,
and in addition thereto, gave and granted, and by charter
confirmed to God and Saint Cuthbert, and the prior and
monks there serving God, for a pure and perpetual alms-
giving, his royal manor consisting of the vill of Heming-
burgh, with all the lands, of Brakenholm, with all the lands
thereto adjoining, together with the church of the vill afore-
said, and all things thereto pertaining in wood and plain, in
moor and meadow, in forest and marsh, together with the
water-mills and ponds, with mere 50 and mere, 51 and sac, 52 and

quietly held his other lands, together with all the royal customs
and liberties which the king himself held therein, when, after
the conquest of England, he held the same in his own hands, and
with the same boundaries, with which he himself, or Tosti
before him, or Siward, had held the said manor.

Bishop Walcher and earl Waltheof were afterwards on the
most friendly and cordial terms, insomuch that, sitting toge-
ther with the bishop, at the synod of the priesthood, he
humbly and obediently would carry out whatever was en-
joined by the bishop in his earldom, for the correction of
Christian manners.

In the year from the incarnation of our Lord 1073, all
points agreed, as to the course of the sun and moon, with the
fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius, in which our Lord wag
baptized, that is to say, the day of the Baptism was on the
eighth day before the ides of January, being the Lord's day and
Epiphany ; the second day of the week was the commence-
ment of His Fast for forty days ; and thus, from the time of the
Baptism of our Lord in the fifteenth year of the reign of
Tiberius, there had been a revolution of two great cycles, that
is to say, of one thousand and sixty-four years.

In this year, William, king of the English, with the especial
assistance of the English whom he had brought with him from
England, subjugated the city which is called Mans, and the
province 57 belonging thereto. The Clito Edgar came to Nor-
mandy from Scotland by way of England, and was reconciled to
king William. Earl Waltheof, sending a strong body of Nor-
thumbrians, took a bloody revenge for the death of his grand-
father earl Aldred ; for the swords of some men whom he had
placed in ambush cut off the sons of Carl who had slain him,
while they were at a banquet at Seteringetun.

pope holding a council, according to the decrees of Saint Peter
the Apostle, and of Saint Clement and other holy fathers, by
edict forbade the clergy, and especially those consecrated to the
divine mysteries, 58 to have wives, or to cohabit with women,
except such as the Nicene synod or other canons excepted.
He also decreed that, in conformity with the sentence of Simon
Peter, not only the buyer and seller of any office, such for instance
as that of bishop, abbat, prior, dean, or titheman of a church,
but whoever abetted them, should receive the condemnation of
Simon Magus. 59 For the Lord hath said, "Freely have ye
received, freely give."

Three poor monks being sent by the Divine Spirit from
the province of the Mercians, that is to say, from Evesham,
came to York, in the province of the Northumbrians, and
requested Hugh FitzBaldric, who at that time held the
shrievalty, to provide them with a guide on their journey, as
far as the place which is called Munkeceastre, 60 that is to say,
the " city of the monks," which place is now called New-
castle. Being escorted thither, and having staid there for
some time, on finding there no ancient vestige of the servants
of Christ they removed to Jarrow, where, the ruins hardly
disclosing what it had been in ancient times, there were to be
seen many monastic edifices with half-ruined churches ; here
they were received with the greatest kindness by bishop
Walcher, who supplied them with all necessaries.

Aldwin was the chief of them, both by reason of ago
and his exemplary manners, while Elfwine was the second,
and Remifrid the third : by these three persons, three mon-
asteries were refounded in the province of the Northum-
brians ; one at Durham, near the hallowed and incorruptible
body of the father Cuthbert, in honor of the holy Virgin Mary ;
another at York, in honor of the same Mary, the mother of
God, where this noble monastery, on its foundation, had for
its first abbat Stephen, its second Richard, its third Geoffrey,
the fourth being the present dignitary, Severinus. The third of
these monasteries was restored at a place which was formerly
called Streinschalh, that is to say, " the bay of the sea," and
is now called Withebi ; 61 of which Benedict is the present abbat.

pagans had with fire and sword reduced the churches and mon-
asteries to ashes, Christianity being almost extinguished, there
were scarcely any churches left, and those few covered with
twigs and thatch ; but no monasteries had been anywhere re-
built for two hundred years. Thus did belief in religion wax
faint, and all religious observances entirely die away ; the name
of a monk was a thing unheard-of by the people in the provinces,
who were struck with amazement when by chance they beheld
any one devoted to the monastic life, and clothed in the garb
of a monk. But on the above-named three persons coming to
dwell among them, they themselves also began to change their
brutish mode of living for the better, to give them all possible
assistance in restoring the sacred places, rebuilding the half-
ruined churches, and even building new ones in the spots where
they had previously existed. Many persons also abandoned a
secular life, and assumed the monastic habit ; few, however, of
these were provincials ; they were mostly persons from the
remote districts of England, who, being allured by the report
of their character, repaired thither, and zealously attached
themselves to them.

Of these, Turgot, afterwards bishop of the Scots, was one.
He, being sprung from a family by no means among the lowest
ranks of the English, was one among a number of hostages, who,
when England was totally subjected to the Normans, had
been placed in confinement in Lincoln castle, which was the
place of safe keeping for the whole of Lindesey. Having
bribed the keepers with a sum of money, he secretly, to the
hazard of his friends, fled to certain Norwegians, who were
then at Grimsby, loading a merchant-ship for Norway, on
board which the ambassadors of king William, who were
about to proceed to Norway, had procured a passage.

When the ship, speeding on at full sail, had lost sight of
land, behold ! the run-away hostage of the king came forth
from the lower part of the ship, where the Norwegians had con-
cealed him, in the sight of all, and caused astonishment among
the ambassadors and their attendants. For he had been sought
in every spot, and the king's tax-gatherers had made their
search in that very ship ; but the cunning of those who con-
cealed him had contrived to deceive the eyes of the searchers.
Upon this, the ambassadors insisted upon their furling their
sails, and by all means steering back the ship towards the



156 AXTTALS OP EOGER DE HOVEDEX. A.D. 1074.

English shore, in order to take back the run-away hostage of
the king. This was stoutly resisted by the Norwegians, whose
wish it was that they should steer onward in the course they
had so prosperously begun ; upon which a division arose, and
prevailed to such a degree that each party took up arms against
the other. But as the force of the Norwegians was superior,
the boldness of the ambassadors very speedily subsided, and
the nearer they approached to land, the more did they humble
themselves to the others.

Upon their arrival there, the runaway youth behaved him-
self becomingly and modestly, showed himself grateful to the
nobles and principal men, and came under the notice of king
Olaf, who being of a very pious turn of mind, was in the
habit of reading holy books, and giving his attention to litera-
ture amid the cares of state. He would also frequently stand
by the priest at the altar, and assist him in putting on the holy
vestments, pouring the water upon his hands, and with great de-
votion performing other duties of a similar nature. Accordingly,
on hearing that a clerk had come over from England, a thing
that seemed somewhat unusual at that period, he employed him
as his own master in learning the Psalms ; in consequence of
which he lived in extreme affluence, the bounty of the king and
nobles flowing in upon him apace. His mind, however, was
often smitten, in a spirit of compunction, with contempt for
the world, and, whenever he was able, he would withdraw
himself from the banquets of the revellers, and take delight
in solitude, praying to God with tears that he would direct
him in the paths of salvation. But, inasmuch as religious
aspirations, when subjected to delay, frequently change, his
mind by degrees fell away from this state, and in consequence
of the success which attended his pursuits, the pleasures of
this world had too great attractions for him.

But he, who, when invited, was unwilling to come of his
own accord, at a future time, by compulsion, entered the house
of his heavenly Father. For some years after, he was returning
home by ship with a large sum of money ; but when out at
sea, the vessel was wrecked in a most violent storm, and his
companions perishing, he lost the whole of his property, having,
with some five or six others, with the greatest difficulty
saved his life. Coming to Durham for the purpose of offering
up his prayers, he informed bishop Walcher of every thing



A.D. 1074. CONSPIRACY AGAINST WILLIAM. 1,5?

that had happened to him, and stated to him that it was his
fixed purpose to assume the monastic habit. On this the
bishop received him with all humility, and, sending him to
Aldwin, of whom mention has been made above, said : " It is
my prayer and my command, that you will receive this my
son, and, clothing him in the monastic habit, will teach him
to observe the monastic rule of life." Aldwin on receiving him,
submitted him to the regular probation, and when he had
passed through that state conferred upon him the monastic
habit, and so trained him by precept and example, that after
his own decease, by order of bishop William, he succeeded him
as prior of the church of Durham, which for twenty years,
less twelve days, he zealously governed. But in the year
when Ranulph was made bishop, who succeeded William,
Alexander the Eighth, king of the Scots, having asked the
assent of Henry, king of the English, thereto, he was chosen
bishop of the church of Saint Andrew.

In the same year in which pope Hildebrand held the above-
named council, Roger, earl of Hereford, son of William, earl of
the East Angles, contrary to the command of king William,
gave his sister in marriage to earl Rodulph. The nuptials
being celebrated with the utmost magnificence, amid a large
concourse of nobles at a place in the province of Grantebridge, 62
which is called Ixning, a great number there entered into a
conspiracy against king William, and compelled earl Waltheof,
who had been intercepted by them by stratagem, to join the con-
spiracy. He, however, as soon as he possibly could, went to
Lanfranc, the archbishop of Canterbury, and received absolu-
tion from him at the holy sacrament, for the crime that he had,
although not spontaneously, committed ; by whose advice, he
also went to king William, who was at the time staying in
Norway, and disclosing to him the whole matter from begin-
ning to end, threw himself entirely upon his mercy.

In the meantime, the chiefs above-mentioned, being deter-
mined to promote the success of this conspiracy, repaired to
their castles, and began, with their supporters, to use all pos-
sible endeavours in encouraging the rebellion. But the vene-
rable Wulstan, the bishop of Worcester, with a great body of
soldiers, prevented the earl of Hereford from fording the river
Severn and meeting earl Rodulph, with his army, at the place

62 Cambridge.



158 ASWALS OF .ROGER DE HOVEDEU. A.D. 1075.

appointed. Wulstan was also joined by Egelwin, the abbat of
Evesham, with, all his people who had been summoned to his
assistance, together with Urso, the sheriff of Worcester, and
"Walter de Lacy, with his troops, and a considerable multitude
of the lower classes. But earl Rodulph having pitched his
camp near Grantebridge, Odo, bishop of Bayeux, the king's
brother, and Geoffrey, bishop of Constance, having collected a
great body both of English and Normans and prepared for
battle, opposed him.

On seeing that his attempts were thus thwarted by the
multitude that opposed him, he secretly fled to Norwich, and
entrusting the castle to his wife and his knights, embarked
on board ship, and fled from England into Brittany ; on which,
being pursued by his adversaries, all of his men whom they
could overtake they either put to death, or else inflicted upon
them various kinds of punishments. After this, the nobles
besieged the castle of Norwich, until, peace being made by the
king's sanction, the countess, with her people, was allowed to
leave England. These events having happened, in the autumn
the king returned from Normandy, and placed earl Roger in
confinement, and in like manner threw earl Waltheof into
prison, although he had besought his mercy.

Edgitha, the former queen of the English, died this year
at Winchester, in the month of December, on which her body
was, by the royal command, conveyed to London, and honor-
ably buried at Westminster, near that of her lord, king Ed-
mund. Here, at the ensuing Nativity of our Lord, the king
held his court, and some of those who had uplifted their necks
against him he banished from England, and others he mangled,
by putting out their eyes, or cutting off their hands ; earls
Waltheof and Roger, condemned by a judicial sentence, he
committed to closer custody.

In the year 1075, earl Waltheof, by command of long
William, was unrighteously led outside of the city of Win-
chester, and there cruelly decapitated with an axe, and buried
in the ground on the spot; but in course of time, God so
ordaining it, his body was raised from the earth, and carried
with great honor to Croyland, and with great pomp buried in
the church there. While he was still in possession of life in
this world, on being placed in close confinement, he unceasingly
bewailed what he had done amiss, and most zealously endea-



A.D. 1077. VIOLENT ACTS OF EOBEET. 159

voured to make his peace with God by means of watchings and
prayers and fastings and almsgiving ; his memory men have
tried to bury in the earth, but we are to believe that in truth
he rejoices with the Saints in heaven, the above-named arch-
bishop Lanfranc, of pious memory, having faithfully attested it,
from whom, on making confession, he had received absolution.
He asserted that he was innocent of the charge on which he
was accused, namely, that of joining in the aforesaid con-
spiracy, and that what he had been guilty of in other re-
spects, he had, like a true Christian, bewailed with the tears
of repentance ; and Lanfranc declared that he himself should be
blessed, if, after the end of his life, he should be able, to enjoy
his happy repose. After him, the care of the earldom of Nor-
thumbria was entrusted to Walcher, bishop of Durham.

After these transactions, the king led his army into Brittany,
and besieged the castle of earl Eodulph, which is called Dol,
until Philip, king of France, forced him to retire.

At this period, as the secular clergy chose rather to submit
to be excommunicated, than to put aside their wives, pope
Hildebrand, in order that he might, if possible, chastise them
by means of others, ordered in the following words that no
person should hear mass performed by a married priest :

" Gregory, the pope, who is also called Hildebrand, the
servant of the servants of God, to all throughout the realms
of Italy and Germany, who show due obedience to Saint
Peter, the Apostolic benediction. If there are any priests,
deacons, or sub-deacons, who are guilty of the crime of for-
nication, we do on behalf of Almighty God, and by the authority
of Saint Peter, forbid them entrance into the church, until
such time as they shall amend and be repentant. But if any
shall prefer to persist in their sinful course, no one of you
is to presume to listen to them while officiating ; inasmuch as
their blessing is changed into a curse, and their prayers into
sinfulness, as the Lord beareth witness by his prophet, saying,
' Your blessings I will curse,' " &c. 62

In the year 1076, Sweyn, king of the Danes, a man greatly
devoted to literature, departed this life, and was succeeded by
his son, Harold.

In the year 1077, Robert, the eldest son of king William,
because he was not allowed to take possession of Normandy,
which, before his arrival in England his father had given to
6 - Mai. ii. '2.



160 AXNALS OF ROGEB DE HOVEDEN. A.D.1080.

him in the presence of Philip, king of the Franks, fled to
France, and, with the aid of king Philip, frequently committed
great depredations in Normandy, burning towns and slaying
men, and thus caused no little trouble and anxiety to his
father.

In the year 1078, after the Assumption of Saint Mary,
Malcolm, king of the Scots, laid waste Northumbria, as far as
the great river Tyne; and having slain many persons and
captured more, returned home with a large amount of spoil.

In the year 1079, king William, while attacking his son
Robert before the castle of Gerbohtret, which king Philip had
given to. him, being wounded by him in the arm, was thrown
from his charger, but immediately, on Robert recognizing
his voice, he dismounted, and bade him mount his own horse,
and so let him depart ; on which, many of his men having
been slain, and some taken prisoners, and his son William
and many others wounded, he took to flight. The venerable
man Robert, who had received priests' orders, at the hands of
the most reverend Wulstan, the bishop of Worcester, was
ordained bishop of Hereford, at Canterbury, by Lanfranc, the
archbishop. This took place on the fourth day before the
calends of January, being the Lord's day.

In the year 1080, 63 Walcher, bishop of Durham, a native of
Lorraine, and a man distinguished for his virtues, was, with-
out reason, murdered by the Northumbrians, at a place which
is called Gatesheued, 64 that is to say, the " goat's head," on the
day before the ides of May, being the fifth day of the week ;
which act was done in revenge for Liulph, a man of noble birth
and high rank.

This person, by hereditary right, was entitled to many pos-
sessions throughout England ; but, because in those times the
Normans were incessantly giving loose in every direction to
their savage propensities, he betook himself with all his family
to Durham, as he was sincerely attached to the memory of
Saint Cuthbert. His wife was Adgitha, daughter of earl Aldred,
by whom he had two sons, Ucthred and Morcar. The sister of
this Adgitha was Elfleda, the mother of earl Waltheof ; for
which reason that earl entrusted his little cousin, Morcar, to

gives a very different account of the circumstances attending it.

the monks of Jarrow, to be nurtured by them in the love
of God. At this time earl Waltheof himself was at Tyne-
mouth ; which place, together with the little child, he placed
at the disposal of the monks. Liulph, the child's father, was
greatly beloved by the bishop ; so much so, that without his
advice he would by no means transact or dispose of the more
weighty questions of his secular business. For this reason
his chaplain, Leofwine, 65 whom he had raised to such a pitch
of favour that hardly anything in the bishopric and earldom 66
was done without his opinion being first consulted, was in-
flamed by the stings of envy, and being, in consequence of
his elevation, greatly inflated with excessive pride, arrogantly
set himself in competition with the above-named Liulph.

In consequence of this, he treated some of his judgments and
opinions with the utmost contempt, and used every possible
endeavour to render them of no effect ; in addition to which,
he would frequently wrangle with him before the bishop,
even using threats, and often provoke him to anger by the use
of contemptuous expressions. On a certain day, when Liulph
had been invited by the bishop to take part in his counsels,
and had given his opinion as to what was legal and just,
Leofwine obstinately opposed him, and exasperated him by the
use of contumelious language. Because Liulph on this occasion
answered him more sharply than usual, Leofwine withdrew
himself hastily from the court of justice, and, calling aside
Gilbert (to whom, being his relative, the bishop had entrust-
ed the earldom of Northumbria to manage as his deputy),
earnestly entreated him to avenge his wrongs and put Liulph
to death as soon as he possibly could effect it.

Gilbert immediately yielded to his iniquitous requests, and,

having assembled together his own men at arms, together with

* those of the bishop and the said Leofwine, proceeded on a certain

night to the house where Liulph was then staying, and most

65 The name of this person, who is called Leobin by William of Malmes-
bury, affords a singular illustration of the extreme incorrectness of the
text. In the same page it is written '* Leodwinus," " Leothwinus,"
"Leolwinus," "Leofwinus," and " Leolfwinus." This faultiness, how-
ever, is far from being confined to proper names.

66 It has been already stated that, after the unfortunate end of earl
Waltheof, the earldom of Northumberland was given in charge to the
bishop of Durham. Bracton informs us that the bishop of Durham had
as full power in the county of Durham as the king had in his own palace.

iniquitously slew him and nearly all his household, in his own
house. On hearing of this, the bishop heaved a sigh from the
inmost recesses of his heart ; and, taking his hood from off his
head, and throwing it on the ground, immediately said in
mournful accents, to Leofwine, who was then present, " By
your factious designs, and most short-sighted contrivances,
Leofwine, these things have been brought about. Therefore,
I would have you know for certain, that both myself, and your-
self, and all my household, you have cut off by means of the
sword of your tongue."

On saying this, he instantly betook himself to the castle,
and immediately sending messengers throughout all Northum-
bria, commanded all to be informed that he was not an ac-
complice in the death of Liulph, but that, on the contrary, he
had banished Gilbert, his murderer, and all his associates,
from Northumbria, and would be prepared to exculpate
himself before a court of ecclesiastical jurisdiction. After this,
having interchanged messages, he and the relatives of those
who were slain, having mutually given and received assurances
of peace, appointed a place and day on which to meet and
come to a better understanding. On the appointed day they
met at the place named, but as the bishop declined to plead
his cause in the open air, he entered the church there, to-'
gether with his clergy and those of his knights who were of
higher rank, and while a council was being held, several
times sent out of the church such of his own followers as he
thought fit, for the purpose of making peace with them.
The people, however, would by no means accede to his re-
quests, for they believed it to be a matter beyond a doubt that
Liulph had been slain by his command ; for, the night after
the death of his relative, 68 Leofwine had not only entertained
Gilbert and his associates at his house, in a friendly and hos-
pitable manner, but even the bishop himself had shown him
favour and hospitality just as before.

In consequence of this, all th ose of the bishop' s party who were
found outside of the church were first slain, only a few escaping
by flight ; on seeing which, the bishop ordered his relative, the

63 " Propinqui sui." This is probably an incorrect reading. We have
been previously informed that Gilbert was a relative of the bishop ; but it
does not appear that Liulph was related to the bishop or to Gilbert. It
may, however, mean " of his neighbour."



A.D. 1081. THE EMPEBOB DEPOSES POPE HILDEBEAND. 163

above-named Gilbert, whose life was sought, to go out of the
church, in order that his death might satisfy the fury of the
enemy. On going out, some knights followed him close for
the purpose of defending him, but being instantly attacked
by the enemy on all sides with swords and lances, they were
killed in an instant ; however, they spared two English thanes,
in consequence of their being of the same blood with them-
selves. They also slew Leofwine, who had so often given
the bishop advice to their disparagement, with some others of
the clergy, directly they came. out.

For when the bishop understood that their fury could by no
means be appeased, unless Leofwine, the head and author of
all this calamity, was slain, he begged him to go out of the
church ; and when he could by no means prevail upon him to do
so, the bishop himself went to the door of the church, and
begged that his own life might be spared, and on their refusal,
covered his head with the border of his garment and went
out of the door, and instantly fell dead, pierced by the swords
of the enemy. After him they ordered Leofwine to come
forth, and, upon his refusal, set fire to the roof and walls of
the church ; on which, preferring to finish his life rather by
being burnt than being slain with the sword, he endured the
flames for some time ; but, after he had been half roasted
alive, he sallied forth, and, being cut to pieces, paid the
penalty for his wickedness and died a shocking death.

To avenge the horrible deaths of these persons, king Wil-
liam, in the same year, ravaged Northumbria, sending thither
Odo, bishop of Bayeux, with a large body of soldiers. In the
autumn of the same year, the same king William sent his son,
Robert, against Malcolm, king of the Scots ; but after he had
proceeded as far as Egelbereth, he returned without completing
his object, and founded Newcastle upon the river Tyne.

William succeeded to the bishopric of Durham on the fifth
day before the ides of November, and on the fourth day before
the nones of January, was consecrated at Gloucester, by Thomas,
the archbishop of York.

At Pentecost, in this year, the emperor Henry, being at
Mentz, determined upon the deposition of pope Hildebrand.
and, on the nativity of Saint John the Baptist, appointed
Wibert, bishop of the city of Ravenna, pope in his stead.

In the year 1081, the emperor Henry marched with an

M 2



164 ANNALS OP KOGEB DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1083.

army to Rome against the pope, but, having laid siege to the
city, was unable to effect an entrance.

In the year 1082, after much slaughter and rapine had
ensued between the emperor Henry and pope Hildebrand,
on the night of Palm Sunday, a great number of persons were
slain. King William placed in confinement in Normandy his
brother, Odo, bishop of Bayeux.

In the year 1083, the emperor Henry stormed the city of
Home, and having taken it, established Wibert in the Apos-
tolic See ; on which, Hildebrand retired to Benevento, and
lived there till the day of his death, and Henry returned to
Germany.

A disgraceful quarrel took place between the monks, and
Turstin, the abbat, of Glastonbury, a man unworthy to be
named, and possessed of no prudence,, whom king William,
taking from the monastery of Caen, had appointed abbat of
that place. Among other doings, in his folly, he treated the
Gregorian chaunt with contempt, and attempted to compel the
monks to leave it off, and learn the chaunt of one William,
of Feschamp, and sing it ; this they took to heart, because
they had, both in this particular and in the other offices of
the church, grown used to the practices of the Roman Church.
Upon a certain day, when they did not expect it, he rushed
into the chapter-house, with an armed body of soldiers, and
pursued the monks, who in their extreme terror had fled into
the church, even to the altar ; and there the soldiers, piercing the
crosses, and images, and shrines of the Saints with darts and
arrows, even went so far as to slay one monk while embrac-
ing the holy altar, who fell dead pierced with a spear ; an-
other also fell at the verge of the altar, transfixed with
arrows ; on which, being compelled by necessity, the monks
stoutly defended themselves with the benches and candle-
sticks belonging to the church, and, though grievously wounded,
succeeded in driving all the soldiers beyond the choir. The
result was, that two of the monks were killed and fourteen
wounded ; some of the soldiers were also wounded.

Upon this, an inquisition was held, and as the principal
fault lay clearly on the abbat' s side, the king removed him,
and replaced him in his monastery in Normandy. A number
of the monks were also, by the king's command, dispersed



A.D. 1083. CHABTEB OF AECHBISHOP THOMAS. 165

among the bishoprics and abbacies, and there kept in confine-
ment. After the king's death, the same abbat repurchased
the abbey from his son, king William, for a sum of five hun-
dred pounds of silver, and wandering about for some years
among the possessions of that church, at a distance from the
monastery itself, just as was befitting a homicide, died in misery.
The monks assembled 69 at Durham, by command of king "Wil-
liam the Younger, on the seventh day before the calends of
June, being the sixth day of the week.

On the fourth day before the nones of November, being the
fifth day of the week, queen Matilda departed this life in Nor-
mandy, and was buried at Caen.

" Thomas, 70 by the grace of God archbishop of York, to the .
bishops and abbats, both those who now hold the said offices in
England also as those who shall succeed them hereafter, and
to all the archbishops, his successors for ever in the see of York,
greeting : Inasmuch as it is our office to perform the duties of
religion to all, so in especial are we bound to pay pious respect
to those Saints of God, from whose bounty it is manifest
that we have received especial benefits. Therefore, we having
been chastened with the scourge of God, and having been
parched in an incredible manner during a period of two
years with weakness from the attacks of fever ; and whereas
all the physicians declared that it was evident that death
alone would be the termination of our sufferings, and that there
were no means by which they might counteract the evil effects
of this prolonged weakness. Wherefore, being warned in a
vision, groaning and weeping I passed a night at the tomb of
Saint Cuthbert, where, being wearied out with disease and
fatigue, I was overcome with sleep ; upon which Saint Cuth-
bert appeared to me in a vision, and touching each of my
limbs with his hands, rendered me, when I awoke, whole
from all infirmity ; and whereas, at the same time, he com-
manded me to be duteous to him in all respects, and requested
that all things whatsoever in my diocese he or his should pos-
sess, should be free and discharged from all burdens whatso-

driven from the abbey by William the First, and placed in confinement ;
otherwise, the event is not inserted in its proper place.

introduction to this letter.

ever ; and inasmuch as, having been aided by the mercies of
the blessed confessor, I have been the more duteous to him,
as it was more especially my bounden duty to pay him the
greatest homage. And whereas William, bishop of Durham, has
brought a letter of pope Gregory the Seventh, from the Aposto-
lic See, to the council of king William sitting at Westminster,
and, with the consent of all, has obtained leave to remove the
secular clergy from his church and substitute monks therein.
Wherefore, greatly rejoicing at all these things, according to the
precept of the abovenamed pope, and according to the command
of our lord king William, and out of the love I am bound to owe
to Saint Cuthbert, with the consent and permission of the chap-
ter of York, and with the confirmation of the whole synod, I
have given and granted, and by this present deed confirmed,
and have afterwards, with my own hand, presented at the altar
unto Saint Cuthbert, the letter underwritten, which is ad-
dressed to Saint Cuthbert and his bishop, and all the monks
his servants Know then, all persons, both present and to come,
that I, Thomas, archbishop of York, in obedience to the pre-
cept of pope Gregory the Seventh, and with the ratification of
our lord king William, and with the attestation thereto of the
whole council of England, and with the consent of the chapter
of York, do give and do grant unto God and Saint Cuthbert, and
to all his bishops in succession, and to all the monks who shall
be there in time to come, that all churches whatsoever, which at
the present time they may happen to possess in my diocese, or
which hereafter they shall canonically obtain by royal grant
or gift of the faithful, or which they shall build upon their own
lands, they shall hold free and entirely acquitted for ever
by me and all my successors, of all claims which belong to me
or to my successors. Wherefore, I will and command that
they shall hold all their churches in their own hands, and pos-
sess them without molestation, and freely place in them their
own vicars, who shall only consult me and my successors as to
the faithful cure of souls, but them as to all other alms-deeds
and benefits ; and further, I do grant, confirm, and command,
that they, as well as their vicars, shall be for ever free and
acquitted from all synodals, 71 and from all aids, imposi-

and my deans and archdeacons, as well as the vicars and
servants of us all. I do also forbid, under penalty of ex-
communication, that any person shall annoy them or their
clergy, upon any pretence whatever, or compel them to go to
synods or chapters, unless they shall be willing so to do of
their own accord. But if any one shall have any complaint
against them or theirs, let him repair to the court of Saint Cuth-
bert at Durham, that he may there receive such redress as he
is entitled to. For, all the liberties and dignities which I or
my successors shall be entitled to in our own churches or in
our lands, we do freely grant for ever unto them and Saint
Cuthbert in all their churches and lands, and without any
deceit or gainsaying, I do, on behalf of myself and my succes^
sors, confirm the free and quiet possession thereof."

In the year 1084, pope Hildebrand, who was also called
Gregory, departed this life. William, king of the English,
levied upon every hide of land throughout England the suin
of six shillings.

In the year 1085, Edmund, abbat of Pershore, a man of re-
markable virtue, departed this life on the seventeenth day be-
fore the calends of July, being the Lord's day. In the same
year, Canute, son of Sweyn, king of the Danes, prepared, with
a strong fleet and the aid of his father-in-law, Robert, earl
of Flanders, whose daughter he had married, to invade Eng-
land ; whereupon, king William, having levied many thousand
soldiers throughout the whole of Gaul, foot and archers, and
taking some from Normandy, in the autumn returned to
England, and dispersing them throughout the whole king-
dom, commanded the bishops, abbats, earls, barons, sheriffs,
and royal bailiffs to supply them with provisions. But when
he learned that his enemies were checked, 73 he sent back part of
his army, and part he retained with himself throughout the
whole of the winter, and held his court at Gloucester during the
Nativity of our Lord ; in which place he gave bishoprics to
his three chaplains, namely, that of London to Maurice, that of
Thetford to William, amUhat of Chester to Robert.

king being slain by his soldiers.

In the year 1086, king William caused the whole of England
to be described, of how much land each of his barons was pos-
sessed, how many knights' fees, how many carrucates, how
many villains, how many animals, and even how much ready
money, each person possessed, throughout the whole of his
kingdom, beginning from the highest down to the lowest, and
how much rent each property could return : ' 4 the whole of
the country being in a state of disturbance in consequence of
the numerous murders occasioned thereby. After this, in the
week of Pentecost, at Westminster, where he was holding his
court, he knighted his son Henry, and shortly after ordered
the archbishops, bishops, abbats, earls, barons, and sheriffs,
with their soldiers, to meet him at Salisbury, on the calends
of August ; and on their coming thither, he compelled their
knights to swear fealty to him against all men.

At this period, the Clito Edgar, having obtained leave of the
king, passed over the sea with two hundred soldiers, and
went to Apulia. His sister, Christiana, entered a monastery
which has the name of Romsey, and assumed the habit of a
nun. In the same year there was a murrain among animals,
and a great pestilence in the air.

In the year 1087, the relics of Saint Nicolas were trans-
ferred from Myra to the city of Bar. In this year, Aldwin,
prior of Durham, departed this life. A raging fire consumed
many cities, and the church of Saint Paul, together with the
largest and best part of London.

On Saturday, the sixth day before the ides of July, the
Danes, in a certain church, conferred the honor of martyrdom
on their king, Canute. In this year, Stigand, bishop of Chi-

Bath, and Turstine, abbat of Pershore, departed this life.
In the same year, before the Assumption of Saint Mary, king
William entered France with an army, and burned with fire
a city which is called Mantes, and all the churches therein,
and two recluses, and then returned into Normandy. But,
upon his return, a dreadful pain in the intestines attacked
him ; and, becoming weaker and weaker every day, when, as
his illness increased, he saw that the day of his death was ap-
proaching, he released from confinement his brother, Odo, the
bishop of Bayeux, earls Morcar and Roger, Siward, surnamed

Barn, and Wulnoth, the brother of king Harold, whom he
had kept in confinement from his childhood, and all besides
whom he had imprisoned, either in Normandy or England.
After this, he gave the kingdom of England to his son
William, and, to his eldest son, Robert, who was then in exile
in France, he left the dukedom of Normandy. And then, being
fortified with the heavenly viaticum, 15 after having reigned
over the English nation twenty years, ten months, and twenty-
eight days, he parted with his kingdom and his life, on the
fifth day before the ides of September, and, having been there
interred, rests at Caen, in the church of Saint Stephen the
Proto-martyr, which he had built from the foundation, and
amply endowed.

WILLIAM THE YOUNGER

On this, his son, William, repaired to England with all haste,
taking with him Morcar and Wulnoth, but, shortly after his
arrival at Winchester, he consigned them to the same strict
confinement as before ; after which, on the sixth day before
Jhe calends of October, being the Lord's day, he was consecrated
king at Westminster, by Lanfranc, archbishop of Canterbury.
Then, returning to Winchester, he distributed the treasures of
his father, as he himself had commanded, throughout England ;
that is to say, to some of the principal churches ten golden
marks, to some six, and to some less. To each of the churches
situate in country places 76 he ordered five shillings to be given,
and crosses, altars, shrines, text-books, 77 candlesticks, chalices,
pipes, 78 and various ornaments, embellished with gold, silver,

mortis."

76 The words are " in villis sitis." The allusion is to the parish churches
throughout the country.

17 This seems the best translation for " textos." which means the book
of the Gospels, which was generally adorned with gold and jewels, and
kept in the treasury of the monastery, and laid on the altar on Saints'-
days and Sundays.

78 " Fistulas." Allusion is made to the pipes which (in the early centu-
ries of the church, when the Holy Eucharist was administered to the
laity in both kinds,) were used by the communicants for the purpose of
sucking the wine out of the cup. The object of this seems to have
been that, by the use of several pipes, more than one might partake of it
at the same time.

and precious stones, to be distributed among the most deserv-
ing churches and the monasteries.

His brother Robert, also, on his return to Normandy,
bounteously divided among the monasteries, churches, and
the poor the treasures which he found, in behalf of the soul
of his father ; and, after having knighted them, allowed
Dunecald, the son of Malcolm, king of the Scots, and Ulph,
the son of Harold, the former king of the English, whom he
had released from confinement, to depart.

In the year 1088, a great dissension arose among the nobles
of England. For a portion of the Norman nobility was in
favour of king William ; but the other, and larger part es-
poused the cause of Robert duke of Normandy, and desired
to invite him to govern the kingdom, and either deliver up
William alive to his brother, or, putting him to death, de-
prive him of his kingdom. The chiefs in this execrable affair
were Odo, bishop of Bayeux, who was also earl of Kent,
Geoffrey, bishop of Constance, Robert, earl of Mortaigne, 80
Roger, earl of Shrewsbury, and the chief men of eminence
throughout the whole kingdom, with the exception of arch-
bishop Lanfranc. This abominable deed they privately discussed,
during Lent, and, immediately after Easter, began to ravage
the country each in his own neighbourhood, and plunder and
pillage it, at the same time providing their castles with fortifi-
cations and provisions. Geoffrey, bishop of Constance, and
Robert de Mowbray repaired to Bristol, where .they had a very
strong castle, and laid waste all the country as far as the place
which is called Bathan. 81 '

The nobles also of Hereford and Shrewsbury, with a
multitude of people from Wales, proceeded as far as Worces-
ter, laying waste and destroying with fire everything before
them. They intended, also, to have taken the church and the
castle, which latter was at that period entrusted to the charge
of the venerable bishop Wulstan. When the bishop heard of
this he was greatly distressed, and, considering what plan he
should adopt, had recourse to his God, and entreated Him to
look down upon His church and His people, thus oppressed
by their enemies. While he was meditating upon these
things, his household sallied forth from the castle, and took
and slew five hundred of them, and put the rest to flight.

A.D. 1088. ODO STHtEENDERS PEVENSEY CASTLE. 171

Roger Bigot entered the castle of Norwich, and spread devas-
tation throughout the country." 2 Bishop Odo, through whom
these evils had arisen, proceeded into Kent, and laid waste
the royal vills, and ravaged the lands of all those who pre-
served their fealty to the king and gained possession of the
castle of Rochester.

On hearing of these things, the king caused the English to
be assembled together, and, pointing out to them the treachery
of the Normans, entreated them to give him their assistance,
on condition that, if they should prove faithful to him in
this emergency, he would grant them better laws, such as they
should make choice of; he also forbade all unjust taxes, and
returned to all their woods and right of venison ; but, whatever
he promised, he soon withdrew. The English however, then
assisted him faithfully. Accordingly, the king assembled
his army for marching on Rochester, where he supposed his
uncle, bishop Odo, was ; but, when they came to Tunbridge,
they found the castle closely shut against the king. How-
ever, the English, boldly storming it, destroyed the whole
castle, and those who were in it surrendered to the king.
After this, the king with his army directed his course towards
the castle of Pevensey ; for bishop Odo had withdrawn from
Rochester and fled to that castle, whither the king, with a
large army, followed him, and besieged the castle for six
entire weeks.

While these things were going on in England, Robert, duke
of Normandy, had assembled a considerable force, and was pre-
paring to send it to England, intending shortly to follow, as
though making sure of England through the agency of bishop
Odo and the others, who were his partisans there. But Wil-
liam the Younger had now taken measures of defence by sea
with his cruisers, which slew many of them on their passage
to England, and sank others at sea ; so much so, that no
man can tell the number of those who perished.

During the period of these transactions at sea, bishop Odo,
and those who were with him, being compelled by hunger,
surrendered the castle of Pevensey, and promised, on oath,
that they would leave England and not enter it again, except

82 The words after " Norwich " here are adopted from the Anglo-
Saxon Chronicle ; as the text has " et omnes vicit in malum," words
which admit of no sense whatever, and are clearly erroneous.



172 ANNALS OF BOGEB DE HOVEDEN. A. D. 1090.

with the leave of king William ; they also engaged that they
would first deliver up the castle of Rochester. But, when
Odo had come to Rochester with the king's men, who, on
the king's behalf, were to receive possession of the castle,
he was immediately placed in confinement together with them,
by those who were in the castle. Some persons assert that
this was done by the cunning contrivance of the bishop. How-
ever, in this castle there were some valiant knights, and almost
all the nobility of Normandy. There was also there, Eustace
the Younger, earl of Boulogne, and many of the nobles of
Flanders. When the king heard of this, he came with his
army to Rochester, and laid siege to the city ; upon which,
after a short time, those who were in it surrendered; and
thus the bishop, who was almost a second king of England,
irrecoverably lost his dignity. But, on arriving in Normandy,
he immediately received charge of the whole province 83 from
duke Robert. William, bishop of Durham, and many others
also, took their departure from England.

In the year 1089, Lanfranc, the archbishop of Canterbury,
departed this life, on the ninth day before the calends of July,
being the fifth day of the week. In the same year, on the
third day before the ides of August, being Saturday, about the
third hour of the day, there was a very great earthquake
throughout England.

In the year 1090, William the Younger, king of England,
with the intention of taking Normandy from his brother Robert
and subjecting it to his own dominions, first took the castle 6f
Walter de Saint Valery, and the castle which has the name
of Albemarle, and, afterwards, several other castles, and placed
knights in them, who committed ravages throughout Nor-
mandy. On seeing this, and discovering the faithlessness of
his own people, duke Robert sent ambassadors to Philip, king
of the Franks, his liege lord, who thereupon came into Nor-
mandy, and the king and the duke laid siege to one of the
castles which was garrisoned by his brother's troops. On this
being told to king William, he secretly sent a considerable
sum of money to king Philip, and, entreating him to desist from
besieging it, succeeded in his object.

83 These words are succeeded by the following detached sentence,
" cujus ordinem causae libellus in hoc descriptus ostendit." It is evidently
corrupt, and capable of no exact translation ; though it probably means,
" the reasons for which will appear from what is previously stated."



A. D. 1091. MALCOLM INVADES NOHTHT7MBRIA. 173

In the year 1091, king William the Younger went over to
Normandy in the month of February, with the design of
taking it from his brother Robert ; but, while he was there,
peace was made between them by treaty, on condition that
the duke should with good faith deliver up to the king
the earldom of Eu, 84 Feschamp, the abbey of Mount Saint
Michael, and Keresburg, 85 with the castles which had revolted
from him, and that the king should reduce to subjection to
the duke the province of Maine and the castles of Normandy,
which were then making resistance to him. It was also
agreed that the king should -restore their lands in England
to all the Normans who had lost them by reason of their
fidelity to the duke, and should also give to the duke as much
land in England as was then arranged between them. In
addition to this, they came to an understanding that if the
duke should die without a son lawfully born in wedlock, the
king should be his heir ; and, in like manner, if the king
should happen to die, the duke should be his heir. Twelve
barons on the king's side and twelve on the duke's guaranteed
this treaty by oath.

In the meantime, while these matters were being treated of,
their brother Henry, 86 having raised all the troops he could,
with the aid of some of the monks in the place, took posses-
sion of Mount Saint Michael, laid waste the king's lands,
and took prisoners some of his men, and spoiled others. In
consequence of this, the king and the duke, assembling an army,
besieged the Mount during the whole of Lent, and had frequent
skirmishes, and lost some men and horses. But the king,
growing wearied of the protracted siege, retired without
coming to terms, and, shortly after, dispossessed the Clito
Edgar of all the honors which the duke had conferred upon
him, and banished him from Normandy.

In the meantime, in the month of May, Malcolm, king of
the Scots, invaded Northumbria with a large army. If he
could only find provisions, his object was to make further
inroads and commit acts of violence upon the people of Eng-
land. But God ordained it otherwise ; and, therefore, he was
impeded in his designs. The king, on hearing of this, re-

84 Called "Owe" in the text. 85 Cherbourg.

86 Of course he would naturally be displeased at the little regard paid
to his interests in the compact then being made.



174 AUNALS OF ROGER DE HOVEDE1T. A.D. 1091.

turned to England with his brother Robert in the month of
August, and shortly after, set out for Scotland with a con-
siderable fleet and an army of horse, with the object of waging
war against Malcolm; on coming to Durham, he restored
bishop William to his see, three years on that very day after he
had left it ; that is to say, on the third day before the ides of
September.

But before the king had reached Scotland, a short time pre-
vious to the feast of Saint Michael, nearly the whole of his
fleet was lost, and many of his horse perished through hunger
and cold ; after w.hich, king Malcolm met him with his army in
the province of Loidis. 87 On seeing this, duke Robert sent for
the Clito Edgar, whom the king had banished from Normandy,
and who w as then staying with the king of the Scots, and, by
his assistance, made peace between the two kings, upon the un-
derstanding that Malcolm should pay homage to him, as he had
paid homage to his father, and that king "William should re-
store to Malcolm the twelve towns which he had possessed in
England under his father, and pay yearly twelve golden marks.
But the peace that was made between them lasted only a short
time. The duke also reconciled the king to Edgar.

On the ides of October, being the fourth day of the week,
a violent flash of lightning struck the tower of the church of
Winchelcomb, and made a wide opening in the wall, close to
the roof ; it split asunder one of the beams, and giving a severe
-blow to the image of Christ, 88 hurled the head to the ground,
and broke the right thigh. The image, also, of Saint Mary,
which stood near the cross, was struck by the flash, and fell
to the ground ; after which, there followed a great smoke, with
an excessive stench, which filled the whole church and lasted
until the monks of the place, chaunting psalms, had gone round
the buildings of the monastery with holy water and incense,
and relics of the Saints.

In addition to this, on the sixteenth day before the calends of
November, being the sixth day of the week, a violent whirl-
wind, coming from the south, blew down more than six hun-
dred houses in London, and a considerable number of churches.
It attacked the church which is called Saint Mary at Arches,
and killing two men there, lifted the roof with the rafters aloft,
and after carrying it to and fro in the air, at length fixed six of

the rafters in the same order in which they had been originally
inserted in the roof, so deep in the ground, that of some of
them only the seventh, of some the eighth part, was visible ;
and yet they were seven or eight and twenty feet in length.

After this, the king returned from Northumbria through
Mercia into Wessex, and kept the duke with him till nearly
the Nativity of our Lord, but was not willing to fulfil the
treaty that had been made between them. The duke being
greatly annoyed at this, on the tenth day before the calends of
January, returned to Normandy with the Clito Edgar.

At this period, according to the reports in England, there
were two so-called popes of Rome, who, disagreeing as to
their right to the title, divided the church of God into two
parties; these were Urban, who was formerly called Odo,
bishop of Ostia, and Clement, whose former name was
Wibert, archbishop of Ravenna ; this matter, not to speak of
other parts of the world, had so greatly occupied the attention
of the church of England for many years, that from the time
that Gregory, also called Hildebrand, departed this life, up to
the present period, it had refused to pay obedience or make
submission to any pope ; Italy and France, however, acknow-
ledged Urban as the vicar of Saint Peter.

In the year 1092, the greater part of the city of London
was destroyed by fire. On the nones of April, being the
second day of the week, Osmund, bishop of Salisbury, with
the assistance of Valceliine, bishop of Winchester, and of John,
bishop of Bath, dedicated the church which he had built with-
in the castle of Salisbury. Bishop Remigius also, who, with
the sanction of king William the Elder, had changed the seat of
his bishopric from Dorchester 91 to Lincoln, wished to dedicate
the church which he had built there, and which was well worthy
of the bishop's chair, as he perceived that the day of his
death was close at hand. But Thomas, the archbishop of York,
firmly opposed him, and asserted that the church was built in
his province. King William the Younger, however, in con-
sideration of a sum of money which Remigius gave him, gave
orders to the bishops of nearly the whole of England to
meet together on the seventh day before the ides of May and
consecrate the church ; but, two days before the time appointed,

91 In Oxfordshire.



176 ANNALS OF EOGEE DE HOVEDEN. A. D. 1093.

by the secret dispensation of God, bishop Remigius departed
from this world, and the dedication of the church stood over
for the present. After this, the king set out for the province of
Northumbria,and rebuilt the city which in the British language
is called Carleil, 92 and in Latin, Lugubalia, and erected a castle
there ; for this city, with some others in those parts, had been
destroyed two hundred years before, by the pagan Danes,
and had remained desolate from that time until the present
period.

In the year 1093, king William the Younger was attacked
by a severe illness at a royal town which is called Alvestan, on
which he repaired with all haste to Gloucester, and there lay ill
throughout the whole of Lent. Thinking that he should shortly
die, at the suggestion of the barons, he promised the Almighty
to correct his mode of living, no longer to sell churches or put
them up for sale, but to protect them with his kingly power,
to destroy unrighteous laws, and to enact righteous ones. The
archbishopric of Canterbury, which he had kept in his own
hands, he gave to Anselm, the abbat of Bee, who was then in
England, and the bishopric of Lincoln to his chancellor, Robert,
surnamed Bloet.

A new church was commenced to be built at Durham, on the
third day before the calends of August, being the fifth day of
the week, bishop William, and Malcolm, the king of the Scots,
and the prior Turgot, on that day laying the first stone of the
foundation. On the day of the feast of Saint Bartholomew the
Apostle, 93 Malcolm, the king of the Scots, came to Gloucester,
to meet king William the Younger, as had been previously
arranged between their ambassadors, in order that, according

92 Carlisle. Holinshed has the following remark upon a passage in
Matthew of "Westminster, " Here have I thought good to advertise you
of an error in Matthew of Westminster, crept in either through misplacing
the matter by means of some exemplifier, either else by the author's mis-
taking his account of years, as 1072 for 1092, referring the repairing of
Carlisle unto William the Conqueror, at what time he made a journey
against the Scots in the said year 1072. And yet not thus contented ; to
bewray the error more manifestly, he affirmeth. that the king exchanged
the earldom of Chester with Rafe or Ranulf de Micenis, alias Meschines,
for the earldom of Carlisle, which the said Meschines held before, and
had begun then to build and fortify that town ; whereas it is certain that
Ranulf de Meschines came to enjoy the earldom of Chester by way of
inheritance." > V. r. The ides.



A.D. 1093. RAVAGES OF THE SCOTS. 177

to the wish of some of the chief men of England, peace might
be renewed and there might exist a lasting friendship between
them; they separated, however, without coming to terms.
For "William, in his excessive haughtiness and pride, con-
temptuously refused to see Malcolm or to treat with him. In
addition to this, he also wished to force him to make redress
in his own court- solely according to the judgment of his own
barons, but Malcolm utterly declined to do so, unless the con-
ference were held upon the confines of the two kingdoms, where
the kings of the Scots had been in the habit of making redress
to the kings of England, and in conformity with the opinion of
the nobles of both kingdoms. Shortly after these events, a very
wonderful sign appeared in the sun.

In the same year, Roger, earl of Shrewsbury, Guido, abbat
of Saint Augustine's, and Paulinus, abbat of the church of
Saint Alban, departed this life. This Paulinus, having by
means of the violent conduct of earl Robert, 94 effected an en-
trance into the church of Tynemouth, in spite of the pro-
hibition of the monks of Durham, who had been the possessors of
it, was there attacked with an illness, and died on his way home
at Seteringtun. 94 * On the day of the feast of Saint Brice, 95
Malcolm king of the Scots, and Edward, his eldest son, were
slain in Northumbria with their men, by the soldiers of Robert
earl of Northumbria ; in whose death the judgment of God is
distinctly visible, from the fact that he and his men perished in
the same province which he had been in the habit, at the dic-
tation of avarice, of laying waste.

For, on five occasions he had afflicted it with dreadful ravages,
and had carried off its wretched inhabitants in slavery ; the first
time in the reign of king Edward, when Egelwin was bishop
of Durham, at the period when Tosti, the earl of Northumbria,
had gone to Rome ; the second time in the reign of king
William, the above-named Egelwin being still bishop, on
which occasion, Cleveland was laid waste ; the third time, in
the reign of the same king William, when Walcher was
bishop of Durham, at which period he proceeded as far as the
river Tyne, and after having slaughtered multitudes of men
and burned many places, re turned with a large amount of booty ;

the fourth time, in the reign of king William the Younger,
when William was hishop of Durham, on which occasion, with
an innumerable army, he came as far as Chester, 96 with the full
intention of proceeding further ; hut a small body of troops
uniting against him, he returned with all speed from very
fear.

The fifth time, having collected all the troops he possibly
could, he invaded Northumbria, with the intention of reducing
it to utter desolation, but was slain near the river Alne, 97
by Morell, 98 a most valiant knight, together with his eldest
eon, Edward, whom he had appointed his successor in the
kingdom. A portion of his army died by the sword of the
enemy, and those who escaped the sword were drowned in
the inundations of the rivers, which were at that time unusu-
ally swollen by the winter rains. The body of this king and
most blood-thirsty butcher, there being none of his own people
to cover it with earth, two of the country-people placed in a
cart, and buried it at Tynemouth ; and thus it came to pass that
in the very place where he had deprived multitudes of life,
liberty, and possessions, by the judgment of God, he himself
lost his life and possessions.

On hearing of his death, Margaret, queen of the Scots, was
affected with such violent grief, that she suddenly fell ex-
tremely ill ; immediately upon which, sending for the priests, she
entered a church, and having confessed to them her sins, caused
herself to be anointed with oil, and to be provided with the
heavenly viaticum, entreating the Lord with most urgent and
repeated prayers, that he would not allow her any longer to re-
main in this world of misery. Her prayers were heard, for on
the third day after the king's death, she was released from the
bonds of the flesh, and, as we have reason to believe, passed
to the joys of everlasting salvation. For, during her life, she
shewed herself a most devoted follower of piety, justice, peace,
and charity ; assiduous in her prayers, she mortified her body
by watching and fasting, enriched churches and monasteries,
and loved and honored the servants and handmaids of God ;
she broke bread to the hungry, clothed the naked, gave lodging,

food, and raiment to all strangers who came to her, and loved
God with all her heart.

After her death, the Scots chose" as their king, Dufenald,
the brother of king Malcolm, and expelled from Scotland all the
English who belonged to the royal court. On hearing of this,
Duncan, the son of king Malcolm, who was at that time in
the service 1 of king William, requested him to give him his
father's kingdom ; and, on his prayer being granted, swore fealty
to him, and immediately repaired with all haste to Scotland,
accompanied by a multitude of English and Normans, and,
expelling his uncle, Dufenald, 2 from the kingdom, reigned
in his stead. Shortly after, some of the Scots meeting together,
cut off nearly the whole of his men ; on which, with a few
others, he made his escape. However, they afterwards allowed
him to reign over them, on condition that he should no more
introduce Englishmen or Normans into Scotland, or allow
them to serve under him.

At this period, a meeting was held of nearly all the bishops
of England, among whom Thomas, the archbishop of York,
held the chief place ; and on the second day before the nones of
December they consecrated Anselm, abbat of Bee, archbishop
of Canterbury. In the same year, William, earl of Eu, being
overcome by his inordinate greediness for money, and allured
by the magnitude of the honors promised him, revolted from
his natural lord, Kobert, duke of Normandy, to whom he had
sworn fealty, and, coming to England, after acting the part
of a guilty seducer,* acknowledged himself a subject of king
William.

In the year 1094, Robert, duke of Normandy, by ambassa-
dors, informed king William that he should renounce the treaty

* " The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle also mentions this election. Upon the
passage, Mr. Ingram, the Translator, observes, " From this expression, it
is evident that, though preference was naturally and properly given to
hereditary claims, the monarchy of Scotland, as well as of England, was
in principle elective. The doctrine of hereditary, of divine, of indefeasible
right, is of modern growth."

which they had made ; he also called him a perjured and per-
fidious man, if he should refuse to observe the compact which had
heen made between them in Normandy. In consequence of this,
about the calends of February, the king went to Hastings, and
while staying there, caused the church of Battle 4 to be dedi-
cated in honor of Saint Martin ; there he also deprived Here-
bert, 5 bishop of Thetford, of his pastoral staff; for he had
secretly intended to go to pope Urban, to seek absolution from
him, on account of the bishopric which he had purchased for
himself, and the abbey he had bought for his father, Ro-
bert, 5 * from king "William, for a thousand pounds. After
this, at mid-Lent, the king went over to Normandy, and, a
truce being agreed on, held a conference with his brother, but
parted from him without coming to terms.

After this, they again mot in the field of Mars ; when those
who, on oath, were to effect a reconciliation between them,
laid all the blame on the king ; on which he would neither
admit his fault, nor observe the treaty. Being greatly em-aged
in consequence, they separated without coming to terms.
The duke took his departure for Rouen, but the king returned
to Eu, and there took up his quarters, and levied soldiers
on every side ; to some of the Norman nobles he gave gold, sil-
ver, and lands, and to some he promised them, in order that they
might revolt from his brother Robert, and subject themselves,
together with their castles, to his sway. Having accomplished
all these matters to his wish, he distributed his soldiers among
the castles which he had either previously held, or had then
gained possession of.

In the meantime, he took the castle which is called Bures, and
of the duke's knights which he found therein, some he sent in
captivity to England, and some he kept in confinement in Nor-

4 Battle Abbey, which had been commenced by William the Conqueror.

5 This was Herbert de Losinga ; whose letters, which were supposed
to be lost, have recently been discovered. Roger of Wendover gives a
different version of this story ; he says, " In 1094, Herebert, surnamed
Losinga, was abbot of Ramsey, but be now by purchase procured himself
to be made bishop of Thetford ; but afterwards, in penitence for his crime
lie went to Rome, where he resigned his simoniacal staff and ring into
the hands of the pope ; but by the indulgence of the Holy See, he re-
ceived the same back again, and returning home, transferred his see to
Norwich, where he established a congregation of monks."

mandy; and, harassing his brother in every way, used his
utmost exertions to deprive him of his patrimony. Accordingly,
Kobert, being compelled by necessity, brought his liege lord,
Philip, king of the Franks, into Normandy with an army ; on
which the king laid siege to the castle of Argenton, and on the
very same day, without any bloodshed, took seven hundred of
the king's knights, together with twice as many esquires, 6 toge-
ther with all the garrison of the castle, and ordered them to
be kept in close confinement, until each should ransom him-
self, after which, he returned to France.

Duke Robert, however, besieged a castle which is called
Holm, until William Peverel and eight hundred men who
defended it surrendered to him. "When this became known
to the king, he sent messengers to England, and ordered
twenty thousand foot soldiers to be sent to Normandy to his
assistance ; who being assembled at Hastings, for the pur-
pose of crossing the sea, by the king's orders, Ranulph took
from them the money that had been given them to purchase
provisions, namely, ten shillings from each man, and, ordering
them to return home, sent the money to the king. In the
meantime, the whole of England was afflicted with oppressive
and unceasing taxes, and a great mortality of the people both
in this and the following year.

In addition to this, first the people of North Wales, and
then those of South Wales, throwing off the yoke of servitude
by which they had been long oppressed, and lifting up their
necks, struggled to regain their liberty. Accordingly, a great
multitude having assembled together, they stormed the castles
that had been founded in West Wales, and, in the provinces
of Chester, Shrewsbury, and Hereford, burned the towns on
every side, carried off plunder, and slew multitudes of English
^nd Normans. They also stormed the castle in the Isle of
Anglesey, and reduced it to subjection.

In the meantime, the Scots treacherously slew their king,
Duncan, and some other persons, by the advice and entreaty of
Dufenald, and then chose him again for their king. Shortly
after, king William returned to England, on the fourth day
before the calends of January, to wage war against the Welch,
and immediately proceeded with his army into W'ales, where
he lost many men and horses.

In the year 1095, at the middle of the seventh hour, on the
night of Saturday, the eighteenth day of the month of January,
Wulstan, the bishop of Worcester, was removed from this world ;
a venerable man, and one of most exemplar) 7 life, who from his
youth had entirely devoted himself to his religious duties, and
who, bent upon gaining the glory of the heavenly kingdom,
with great devotion and humility of mind had carefully
served God with the utmost zeal, and departed after many
struggles of pious agony. This took place in the year, from the
first day of the world, according to the assured account con-
tained in the Holy Scriptures, five thousand two hundred and
ninety-nine, 7 in the four hundred and seventy-sixth year of the
present great year 8 from the beginning of the world, in the
one thousand and eighty-fourth from the Passion of our Lord
according to the Gospels, in the one thousand and sixty-sixth
year according to the Chronicle of Bede, in the thousand and
sixty-first year according to Dionysius, 9 in the year from the
arrival of the Angles in Britain seven hundred and forty-five,
from the arrival of Saint Augustine four hundred and ninety-
eight, from the death of Saint Oswald the archbishop, one hun-

Paschal cycle, in the five hundred and tenth year of the tenth

eighteenth lustrum of his age, and in the third year of the
seventh lustrum 14 of his pontificate.

In a wondrous manner, at the very hour of his departure,
he appeared in a vision to his friend, Robert, the bishop of
Hereford, to whom he was especially attached, at a town

the same thing. Possibly the figures are incorrectly stated.

called Cricklade, and ordered him to make haste to "Worces-
ter, to bury him. The ring, also, with which he had received
the pontifical benediction, God would allow no one to draw
from off his finger, lest, after his death, the holy man should
appear to have deceived his friends, to whom he had frequently
foretold that he would not part with it, either in his lifetime or
at the day of his burial.

On the day before the nones of April, it seemed at night as
though stars were falling from heaven. "Walter, bishop of
Albano, legate from the Holy Church of Some, being sent by
pope Urban, came to England "before Easter, to bring the pall
to king William, for which he had sent the year before ; which,
according to order, was, on the Lord's day, being the fourth
day before the ides of June, taken by him to Canterbury, and
laid upon the altar of our Saviour, and then assumed by
Anselm, and suppliantly kissed by all, as a mark of reverence
to Saint Peter.

On the sixth day before the calends of July, being the third
day of the week, Robert, bishop of Hereford, a man of extreme
piety, departed this life. The above-named "Wulstan, bishop
of "Worcester, appeared to him in a vision, on the thirty-second
day after he had departed from this world, and sharply rebuked
him for his negligence and heedlessness, admonishing him to
use his best endeavours to amend both his own life and those
of his flock, with the utmost vigilance : if he did this, he af-
firmed that he would soon obtain pardon of God for all his
sins, and added, that he would not long retain his seat in the
chair in which he then sat, but that, if he should choose to be
more vigilant, he would be enabled to rejoice with himself in
the presence of God. For both of these fathers had been most
zealous in their love of God, and most attached to each other ;
therefore we have reason to believe that he who was the first to
take his departure from this world unto God, felt an anxiety
for his most beloved friend, whom he had left in this world,
and used his best endeavours that he might, as soon as possible,
together with himself, rejoice in the presence of God.

At this period, Robert de Mowbray, earl of Northumbria,
and William de Eu, with many others, attempted to de-
prive king William of his kingdom and life, and to make
Stephen de AJbemarle, his aunt's son, king, but were dis-
appointed. For, on learning this, the king levied an army



184 ANNALS OF KOGEE DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1095.

throughout the whole of England, and, during two months, be-
sieged the castle of the above-named earl Robert, at Tynemouth;
and, having in the mean time taken a certain small fortress, he
captured almost all the earl's bravest soldiers, and placed them
in confinement, and then, laying siege to the castle, took it, and
placed in custody the earl's brother, and the knights whom he
found there. After this, over against Bebbanbirg, 14 * that is
to say, the city of Bebba, whither the earl had fled, he erected
a castle, and called it "Malvoisin," 15 and, having placed
soldiers therein, returned to the country south of the Humber.

After the king's departure, the garrison of Newcastle 16 pro-
mised oarl Robert that they would allow him to enter it if he
came secretly. Being overjoyed at this, he went forth on a
certain night for that purpose, with thirty knights ; on learn-
ing which, the knights who garrisoned the castle followed him,
and, through messengers, made known his departure to the
garrison of Newcastle. Not aware of this, on a certain Sun-
day, he made the attempt to carry out his plans, but failed,
having been thus detected ; on which, he fled to the monastery
of Saint Oswin, the king and martjT ; 1? where, on the sixth
day of the siege, he was severely wounded in the thigh, while
fighting with his adversaries, many of whom were also
wounded, and many slain. Some of his men were also
wounded, but all were captured, and he himself took refuge in
the church ; from which, being dragged forth, he was placed in
confinement.

In the meantime the Welch stormed the castle of Mont-
gomery, and slew there some of the men of Hugh, earl of
Shrewsbury ; at which the king being exasperated, he imme-
diately commanded an expedition to be directed against it ; and,
after the feast of Saint Michael, led an army into Wales, and
there lost many men and horses. On his return thence, he
ordered earl Robert to be taken to Bamborough, and his eyes
to be put out, unless his wife and his neighbour, Morel, 18 would
surrender the castle. Compelled by this necessity, they forth -

with surrendered the castle. The earl, being placed in close
confinement, was led to Windsor ; on which, Morell disclosed
to the king the causes of the conspiracy taking place.

In the year 1096, William, bishop of Durham, died at
Windsor, the royal palace, on the fourth day before the nones
of January, being the second day of the week, but was buried
at Durham, in the chapter-house there, on the northern side,
having on the south the body of bishop Walcher; in the
middle rests the body of Turgot, formerly bishop of the Scots,
and prior of that church.

On the octave of the Epiphany, a council was held at
Salisbury, and the king ordered William de Eu, who had been
conquered in single combat, to be deprived of his eyes and
his virility, and William Deandri, his sewer, his aunt's
son, who had been privy to his treason, he ordered to be
hanged ; earl Odo of Champagne, who was the father of the
above-named Stephen, and Philip, son of Roger earl of Shrews-
bury, and some others, who had a guilty knowledge of the
plot, he placed in confinement.

In this year, pope Urban came into France, and a synod
was held at Clermont, 19 during Lent. He exhorted the Chris-
tians to set out for Jerusalem, for the purpose of waging war
against the Turks, Saracens, Turcopoles, 19 * Persians, and other
pagans, who at that period had overrun Jerusalem, and, having
expelled the Christians, were in possession of Juda3a. Imme-
diately after his exhortation, at the same synod, Raymond,
earl of Saint Gilles, and many others with him, assuming
the emblem of the cross of Christ, engaged to undertake this
pilgrimage in the cause of God, and to do what he had invited
them to do : on hearing of which, other Christians in Italy,
Germany, France and England, vying with each other, made
preparations for the same expedition. The chiefs and leaders
of these were Adimar, bishop of Puy, with a great number of
other prelates, Peter the Hermit, Hugh the Great, brother to
Philip, king of the Franks, Godfrey, duke of Lorraine,
Stephen, count of Chartres, Robert, duke of Normandy,
Robert, earl of Flanders, the two brothers of duke Godfrey,

19 This council at Clermont, in Auvergne, continued from the 18th to
the 28th of November, A.D. 1095, and not in 1096.

19 * Turcopoles are supposed to have been the children of Christiau
mothers and Turkish fathers.

namely, Eustace, earl of Boulogne, and Bald win, Raymond, tlie
above-named earl, and Boamond, the son of Robert Guis-
card ; and with these followed an immense multitude of people
of all languages.

On the seventeenth day before the calends of July, being
the Lord's day, Sampson was consecrated bishop of Worcester,
in the church of St. Paul, at London, by Anselm, the arch-
bishop of Canterbury. After this, Robert, duke of Normandy,
having determined to set out for Jerusalem with the rest,
sent ambassadors to England, and requested his brother Wil-
liam to renew the treat}' of peace between them, and to lend
him ten thousand marks of silver and receive from him the
dukedom of Normandy as a security ; upon which, the king,
being desirous to comply with his request, gave orders to the
nobles of England that each one should, to the best of his
ability, supply him with money with all possible haste. Ac-
cordingly, the bishops, abbats, and abbesses, broke up the golden
and other ornaments of the churches ; the earls, barons, and
sheriffs stripped their soldiers and villains, and supplied the
king with no small amount of gold and silver. In the month
of September the king crossed the sea and made peace with
his brother, giving him six thousand six hundred and sixty-
six pounds of silver, and receiving from him Normandy in
pledge.

In the year 1097, "William, king of the English, returned
to England at the season of Lent, and, after Easter, set out a
second time 20 for Wales, with an army of horse and foot,
with the intention of destroying all persons of the male sex.
However, he was unable to take or slay hardly any of them, but
lost some of his own men, and a great number of horses.
After this, he sent the Clito Edgar to Scotland, with an army,
in order that, after expelling his uncle, Dufenald, who had
usurped the throne, he might make his cousin Edgar, the son
of king Malcolm, king in his stead.

On the thirteenth day before the calends of July, being
Saturday, the Christians took the city of Nice. On the third
day before the calehds of October, and the fifteen days fol-
lowing, a comet appeared. Some persons at this period affirmed
that they had seen in the heavens a wonderful sign, like a fire
burning in the shape of a cross.

* This was his third expedition. See under the years 1094 and 1095,



A.D. 1098. ANTIOCH TAKEN BY THE CHUISTIAXS. 187

Shortly after this, a misunderstanding arose between the
king and Anselm, the archbishop of Canterbury, because, from
the time he was made archbishop, he had not been allowed to
hold a synod and correct the evils which had sprung up
throughout England ; on which he crossed the sea, and re-
muining for a time in France, afterwards proceeded to pope
Urban at Rome. About the time of the feast of Saint
Andrew, the king set out from England for Normandy. On
the second day before the calends of January, Baldwin, abbat
of the monastery of Saint Edmund, a man of exemplary piety
and of French extraction, departed this life.

In the year 1098, on the third day before the nones of
January, being Sunday, Valcelline, the bishop of Winchester,
departed this life. In the spring of this year, William the
Younger, king of the English, subdued the city which is called
Le Mans, and by force reduced a great part of that province
to subjection. In the meantime, Hugh, earl of Shrewsbury,
and with him Hugh, earl of Chester, made a descent upon the
island of Mevania, which is usually called Anglesey, with a
body of troops, and slew many of the Welch whom they
there captured, and of others they cut off the hands or feet,
and then, depriving them of their virility, put out their eyes.
A certain priest also, named Kenred, a man of advanced age,
from whom the Welch had received advice in their affairs,
they dragged out of his church, and, having deprived him of
his virility and put out one of his eyes, cut out his tongue ;
but, on the third day after, by the Divine mercy, his speech was
restored to him.

At this period, Magnus, king of Norway, son of king
Olaf, the son of king Harold Harfager, wishing to add the
islands of Orkney and Anglesey to his realms, came thither, 21
with a few ships ; but, on his making an attempt to land,
Hugh, earl of Shrewsbury, accompanied by a great number of
armed knights, met him on the sea-shore ; and, according to
general report, being struck by an arrow from the king's own
hand, was slain on the seventh day after he had exercised his
cruelty on the above-named priest.

On the third day before the nones of July, being the fourth
day of the week, the city of Antioch was taken by the Chris-
tians ; a few days after which, the spear with which, while

suspended on the cross, the Saviour of the world was pierced,
was, through the revelation of the Apostle Andrew, the most
nxeek of the Saints, discovered in the church of Saint Peter the
Apostle. Being encouraged on finding this, on the fourth day
before the calends of July, being the second day of the week, the
Christians, carrying it with them, marched forth from the
city, and, engaging with the pagans, put to flight Corbaran,
the commander of the soldiers of Soldan, the king of Persia, and
the Turks, Arabs, Saracens, and many other nations, at the
edge of the sword, and, after slaying many thousands, by the
aid of God gained a complete victory.

Throughout the whole of the night of the fifth day before
the calends of October in this year, there was an extraordi-
nary brightness. In the same year, the bones of Canute, the
king and martyr, were raised from the tomb, and, with due
honor, placed in a shrine. Roger, the duke of Apulia, having
assembled a great army, laid siege to the city of Capua, which
had revolted against his authority. Pope Urban, attended,
according to his command, by Anselm, the archbishop of Can-
terbury, set out for the council which he had appointed to be
held at Bar, on the calends of October. At this council, many
points of the Catholic faith were discoursed upon by the suc-
cessor of the Apostles, with great eloquence. Here also, a
question being mooted on the part of the Greeks, who wished
to prove, on the authority of the Evangelists, that the Holy
Ghost proceeded only from the Father, the above-named
Anselm treated and discoursed and explained so admirably
on the subject, that there was no one at the meeting who
did not pi'onounce himself satisfied thereby.

In the year 1099, in the third week after Easter, pope
Urban held a great council at Home, at which he excommuni-
cated all laymen who gave investiture to churches, and all who
received investiture from the hands of laymen, as well as all
those who consecrated persons for the duties of the office so
bestowed. He also excommunicated those who, to gain eccle-
siastical honors, did homage to laymen; affirming that it
seemed most shocking that hands which had attained a dis-
tinction so high that it was granted to none of the angels,
namely, by their touch, 22 to create the God who created all

22 " Siguaculo ;" probably in allusion to marking with the sign of the

things, and in the presence of God the Father, to offer up his
own self for the salvation of the whole world, should he re-
duced to such a pitch of disgraeefulness or folly as to become
the handmaids of those hands which by day and night are
denied by obscene contact, or, used to rapine and the unrighteous
shedding of blood, are stained thereby ; upon which, all shouted
with one consent, " So be it ! So be it !" and thereupon the council
was concluded. After this, the archbishop 24 proceeded to Lyons.

William the Younger, king of the English, returned to Eng-
land from Normandy, and, .at Pentecost, held his court at
London, and gave the bishopric of Durham to Ranulph, whom
he had appointed manager of the affairs of the whole kingdom ;
and, shortly afterwards, he was consecrated there by Thomas,
archbishop of York.

On the 'ides of July, being the sixth day of the week, Jeru-
salem was taken by the Christians ; and, soon after, on the
eleventh day before the calends of August, Godfrey, duke of
Lorraine, was elected king by the whole army. On the
fourth day before the calends of August, being the fifth day of
the week, pope Urban departed this life. On the second day
before the ides of August, being the same day of the week,
the Christians fought a very great battle before the city of
Ascalon, with Lavedal, 25 the commander of the army and
second in rank in the whole kingdom of Babylon, 26 and, by
the exceeding bounty of Christ, gained a wondrous victory.
Paschal, a venerable man, who had been ordained priest
by pope Hildebrand, having been elected pope by the Eoman
people, was consecrated on the following day. On the third
day before the nones of November, the sea overflowed the land,
and swept away a great number of towns and men, and oxen
and sheep innumerable.

In the year from the incarnation of our Lord 1100, pope
Clement, who was also named Wibert, departed this life.

William the Younger, king of the English, while engaged
in hunting in the New Forest, which in the English language
is called Itene, 27 was struck by an arrow incautiously aimed
by Walter, a Frank, surnamed Tyrell, and died, in conse-

quence, on the fourth day before the nones of August, being
the fifth day of the week, in the eighth year of the indic-
tion. The body was carried to Winchester, and buried at
the old monastery there, in the church of Saint Peter. And
not undeservedly did this befall him, for, as popular rumour
affirmed, this was undoubtedly the great might of God and
his vengeance. For, in ancient times, that is to say, in the
days of king Edward and the other kings of England, his
predecessors, that same district flourished most abundantly
in inhabitants, and worshippers of God, and churches, but, by
the command of king William the Elder, the people being
driven away, the houses half destroyed, and the churches pulled
down, the land was rendered fit only for the habitation of
wild beasts; and this, according to general belief, was the
cause of the mishap ; for it was the fact that, some time be-
fore, Richard, the brother of this same king William the
Younger, lost his life in the same forest ; and a short time
previously, his cousin Richard, son of Robert duke of Nor-
mandy, while hunting there, was pierced by an arroAv dis-
charged by one of his knights, of which wound he died. In
the place, also, where the king fell, in former times a church
had been built, but, as previously stated, in his father's time,
it was levelled with the ground.

In the days of this king, as in part already mentioned,
there were many portentous signs beheld in the sun, moon, and
stars ; the sea, also, frequently flowed beyond its usual limits
on the shore, and swept away men and animals, towns, and a
vast number of houses. In a village which is called Berk-
shire, 28 just before the king's death, blood flowed from a spring
during a period of three weeks. 29 The devil, also, showed
himself frequently, in a frightful shape, to many Normans in
the woods, and made many communications to them respect-
ing the king and Ranulph and some other persons. Nor is this
to be wondered at, for in their time almost all equity on part
of the laws was silent, and all grounds for justice being sup-
pressed, money alone held sway with the men in power. In
fine, at this period, some persons paid more obedience to the
royal wishes than to justice ; so much so, that Ranulph, con-

bury says that this took place at the village of Finchampstead, in the
county of Berks. w William of Malmesbury says fifteen days.

trary to ecclesiastical law and the prescribed rules of his order
(for he was a priest), first put up to sale abbacies, and then
bishoprics, the holders of which were dead, having lately re-
ceived the presentations from the king, to whom he paid
yearly no small sum of money. The influence of this man
became so extensive, and so greatly did his power increase
in a short space of time, that the king appointed him judge
and general manager of the whole kingdom.

Having secured this extent of power, in every quarter
throughout England he mulcted some of the richest and most
wealthy by taking from them their property and lands. The
poorer classes he unceasingly oppressed by heavy and unjust
taxes, and, in many ways, both before he received his bishopric
and after, persecuted both great and small in common, and
ceased not to do so up to the period of the king's death. For
on the very day on which the king met with his death, he
held in his own hands the archbishopric of Canterbury and
the bishoprics of Winchester and Salisbury.



HENRY THE FIIIST.

King "William reigned fourteen years all but twenty-eight
days, and was succeeded by his younger brother, Henry.
Shortly after, on the nones of August, he was consecrated king
at Westminster, by Maurice, the bishop of London ; and, on
the day of his consecration, he set free the holy church of
God, which had been sold and let to farm in his brother's time;
he did away with all bad customs and iniquitous exactions by
which the kingdom of England was unrighteously oppressed ;
he also established unbroken peace in his kingdom, and com-
manded that it should be maintained. To all in common he
restored the laws of king Edward, together with those amend-
ments to them which his father had made : but the forests,
which he had made and held, he retained in his own hands.

Not long after this, on the seventh day before the ides of Sep-
tember, he placed Eanulph, the bishop of Durham, in confine-
ment in the Tower of London, and recalled Anselm, arch-
bishop of Canterbury, from Gaul.

In the meantime, Robert, earl of Flanders, and Eustace, earl
of Boulogne, returned home first, and after them Robert, duke of



192 ANNALS OF ROGER DE HOVEBEN. A.D. 1101.

Normandy, with the wife whom he had married in Sicily.
Shortly after this, Henry, king of the English, assembled the
elders of England 30 at London, and took to wife Matilda, the
daughter of Malcolm, king of the Scots, and of queen Margaret,
and sister of the kings Edgar, Alexander, and David; on
which she was consecrated queen, and crowned hy Anselm,
archbishop of Canterbury, on the Lord's day, being the day of
the feast of Saint Martin.

Thomas, archbishop of York, a man whose memory was
revered, and of exemplary piety, affable, and beloved by all,
departed this life at York, on the Lord's day, being the ftmr-
teenth day before the calends of December, and was succeeded
by Gerard, the bishop of Hereford.

In the year 1101, Louis, king of the Franks, visited the
court of king Henry at London, at the time of the Nativity of
our Lord. On the calends of February, Ranulph, the bishop
of Durham, escaped from confinement, by means of extreme
artfulness, and, crossing the sea, went to Robert, duke of Nor-
mandy, and persuaded him to make a hostile invasion of Eng-
land. In addition to this, many of the powerful men in this
country sent ambassadors to him, and begged him to come
with all haste, offering him the crown and the kingdom. On
the eighth day before the ides of June, the 'city of Gloucester,
together with the principal monasteiy there and many others,
was destroyed by fire.

In consequence of the above representations, Robert, duke
of Normandy, having collected a vast number of knights, archers,
and foot, assembled his ships at a place which, in the Norman
language, is called Treport ; 31 on learning which, king Wil-
liam gave orders to his sailors to watch the seas, that no one
might approach the English territory from the country of
Normandy, and, having collected an innumerable army through-
out the whole of England, he himself pitched his camp not
far from Hastings, in Sussex ; for he considered it a matter of
certainty that his brother would land in that neighbourhood.

But duke Robert, acting on the advice of bishop Ranulph,
so wrought upon some of the king's sailors, by making them
promises of different kinds, that, forsaking the fealty which
they owed the king, they went over to him, and acted as
his guides to England. All things, therefore, being in readi-

ness, together with, his army, he embarked, and, about the
time of the feast of Saint Peter ad Vincula, landed at a
place called Portesmudh, 31 and immediately moving on his
army towards Winchester, encamped in a suitable spot. On
learning his arrival, some of the chief men of England at
once, as they had previously arranged, went over to him, while
others, concealing their sentiments, remained with the king.
But the bishops, the common soldiers, and the English, with
resolute determination, sided with him, and were unanimously
prepared to go forth to battle in his cause.

However, the more prudent men on both sides, having held
a discreet conference among themselves, made peace between
the brothers on the following terms : that the king was to pay
yearly to the duke three thousand marks of silver and restore
gratuitously to all the ancient dignities in England which they
had lost in consequence of their fidelity to the duke ; and in
like manner, the duke was to restore them to those, who, for
the king's cause, had lost their dignities in Normandy, without
any recompense. On these terms being made, the king's army
returned home, and part of the duke's returned to Normandy,
while part remained with him in England.

In this year, Godfrey, king of Jerusalem, son of Eustace the
elder, earl of Boulogne, who had been previously the most
powerful duke of Lorraine, departed this life, and rests entombed
in the church of Golgotha. After his death, the Christians
unanimously elected his brother, Baldwin, their king. At
this period, Robert de Belesme, earl of Shrewsbury, the son
of earl Roger, commenced (with the view of opposing king
Henry, as the event proved,) to repair with a broad and high
wall the castle which Agelfleda, lady of the Mercians, in the
reign of her brother Edward the Elder, had formerly built on
ihe western side of the river Severn, at a place called Bridge j 33
ne also began to build another in Wales, at a place which is
called Carrocove.

In the year 1102, the above-named earl Robert de Belesme,
who also at that time ruled over the earldom of Ponthieu, and
was possessed of a considerable number of castles in Nor-
mandy, strongly fortified the city of Shrewsbury and the castle
there, as also the castles of Arundel and of Titchil, 34 with

provisions, engines of war, arms, knights, and foot-soldiers,
against king Henry. He also hastened, by every possible me-
thod, working day and night, to complete the walls and towers
of the castles of Bridge and Carrocove ; the Welch also, and
his own men, he encouraged by gifts of honors, lands, horses,
and arms, and by various other presents, to become more zeal-
ous and faithful to himself, and more ready to do what he
wished.

These attempts, however, and his efforts were very soon
stopped short. For his plots and intentions being, by means
of certain information, discovered, the king pronounced him
a public enemy. On this, at once assembling all the Welch
and the Normans he possibly could at that moment, he and
his brother Arnold laid waste part of the borough of Staf-
ford, and carried away thence into Wales many beasts of
burden and animals, together with some of the people. The
king, however, without delay, laid siege first to his castle of
Arundel, and, having erected castles around it, retired. He
then ordered Robert, bishop of Lincoln, to lay siege to the
castle of Tickill ; while he himself, with an army levied
throughout the whole of England, besieged the castle of
Bridge, and ordered his people to construct engines of war
and erect a castle there. In the meantime, by some trifling
presents, he easily prevailed upon the Welch, in whom earl
Robert placed great confidence, to disregard the oaths they
had sworn to him, and entirely forsake him, and join in the
attack against him. The consequence was, that, within thirty
days, the city and all the castles were surrendered ; and, having
now subdued his enemy, Robert the king, ignominiously expelled
him from England, and, shortly after, condemned his brother
Arnold to a like fate, as a reward for his perfidious conduct.

After these events, king Henry being at London, with all
the chief men of his kingdom, both ecclesiastics and those of
the secular order, at Westminster he invested two of his clergy
with bishoprics, appointing Roger, his chancellor, bishop of
Salisbury, and Roger, his chief of the larder, bishop of Here-
ford. Here, also, Anselm, archbishop of Canterbury, held a
great synod, upon matters relating to the Christian reli-
gion, the following prelates sitting there with him : Gerard,
archbishop of York, Maurice, bishop of London, William,
bishop elect of Winchester, Robert, bishop of Lincoln, Samson>

bishop of "Worcester, Robert, bishop of Chester, John, bishop
of Bath, Herbert, bishop of Norwich, Ralph, bishop of
Chichester, Gundulph, bishop of Rochester, and the two
who had lately received investiture, Roger and the second
Roger. Osborn, 35 bishop of Exeter, being kept away by his
infirmities, was unable to take part in the synod. At this
synod, many abbats of French extraction, and some English,
were deposed and deprived of their dignities, which they had
unrighteously acquired, or had led a disgraceful life while
enjoying them; namely, Guido, abbat of Pershore, Aldwin,
abbat of Ramsey, the abbat of Middleton, Bodric, abbat of
Burgh, Richard, abbat of Ely, and Robert, abbat of Saint
Edmund's.

The above-named Roger, bishop elect of Hereford, was at-
tacked with a malady, at London, and died; upon which,
the queen's chancellor, Reinelm by name, was, with a similar
investiture, substituted in his place. Henry, the king of the
English, this year, gave Mary, the sister of queen Matilda, in
marriage to Eustace, earl of Boulogne.

In the year 1103, a great disagreement arose between king
Henry and archbishop Anselm, because the archbishop would
not consent to the king conferring the investiture of churches,
nor hold communion with those to whom the king had pre-
viously presented churches, as the successor of the Apos-
tles had forbidden him and all others to do so. For this
reason, the king ordered Gerard, the archbishop of York, to con-
secrate the bishops on whom the king himself had conferred
investiture; 37 namely, "William Giffard, and Roger, who had
been his chaplain, 38 and to whom he had lately given the
bishopric of Salisbury. Accordingly, Gerard obeyed the king's
command ; but, in the cause of justice, William Giffard dis-
regarded it, and rejected the benediction of archbishop Gerard.
In consequence of this, by the king's sentence, he was stripped
of everything, and banished from the kingdom ; the others,
however, remained unconsecrated.

Shortly before this, Reinelm had returned to the king the
bishopric of Hereford, because he was sensible that he had
offended God, in having received the investiture of a church
from the hand of any layman. After this, at Easter, the king

held his court at Winchester ; where, after receiving many
injuries and divers affronts which he put up with, arch-
bishop Anselm, at the king's request, set out for Rome on the
fifth day before the calends of May, as had been arranged
between him and the king, having in his company William,
the bishop elect of Winchester, and some abbats who had been
deprived of their abbeys, namely, Richard, abbat of Ely, and
Aldwin, abbat of Ramsey.

Robert, duke of Normandy, came over to England to confer
with the king, his brother ; and, before he left England,
gave up to him the three thousand marks of silver which the
king, according to treaty, was to pay him each year. In the
province which is called Berkshire, at a place the name of
which is Hamstede, blood was seen 39 by many to spring out of
the earth.

In the same year, on the third day before the ides of August,
there was a violent storm of wind, which did such great mischief
to the fruits of the earth throughout England that those who
were then living had never seen the like at any previous time.

In the year 1104, the venerable men, Walter, abbat of
Evesham, and Serlo, abbat of Gloucester, departed this life ;
the former on the thirteenth day before the calends of February,
the latter on the third day before the nones of March. At
Pentecost, king Henry held his court at Westminster. In the
same year, on the seventh day before the ides of June, being
the third day of the week, four circles of a white color were
seen around the sun, at about the sixth hour, one circle within
another, just as though they had been painted there. All
were astonished who saw this, as they had never before seen
the like. In this year William, earl of Mortaigne, was de-
prived of all the lands he possessed in England. It is not
easy to describe the misery which at this period the land of
England endured, by reason of the king's exactions.

In consequence of the unbelief of certain abbats, in the
pontificate of bishop Ranulph, the body of Saint Cuthbert the
bishop was shown, and was, by Ralph, abbat of Seez, 41 after-

year 1100, the name of the place being added. The Saxon Chronicle
mentions it under this year ; William of Malmesbury, as taking place in
the reign of king William.

wards bishop of Kochester, and after that, archbishop of
Canterbury, and the brethren of the church of Durham, by
clear proofs, found uncorrupted, together with the head of
Saint Oswald, the king and martyr, and the relics of Saint
Bede, and many others of the Saints, in the presence of earl
Alexander, the brother of Edgar, king of the Scots, and after-
wards king. This disinterment took place four hundred and
eighteen years five months and twelve days after his burial ;
being the sixth year of the reign of king Henry, and the sixth
of the bishopric of Kanulph, and being from the beginning of
the world, according to Bede and the Hebrew version, in the
year five thousand three hundred and eight/ 2 and according to
the Seventy 43 interpreters, in the year six thousand three hun-
dred and eight.

In the year 1105, Henry, king of the English, crossed the
sea ; and nearly all the chief men among the Normans, on his
arrival, disregarding the duke, their liege lord, to whom they
had sworn fealty, ran after the king's gold and silver, which he
had brought from England, and delivered up to him the castles
and fortified cities. He burned Bayeux, together with the
church of Saint Mary there, and took Caen from his bro-
ther ; after which, he returned to England, as he was unable
to reduce the whole of Normandy to subjection, and in order
that, supported by a large sum of money, he might return
in the following year, and deprive his brother thereof, and ren-
der subject to himself the part that remained. However,
William de Mortaigne, wherever he had the power, did injury
to the king's property and men, on account of his own estates
which he had lost in England.

In the year 1106, Robert, duke of Normandy, came to
England, for the purpose of conferring with his brother, king
Henry, whom he met at Northampton. On this occasion the
duke begged him to restore the places he had taken from him
in Normandy; with which request the king refusing to comply,
the duke, being greatly enraged, crossed the sea to Normandy.

In the first week of Lent, on the evening of the calends of
March, being the sixth day of the week, a star of unusual
appearance became visible, and, during twenty-five days, in

the same manner, and at the same hour, was seen to shine
between the south and the west. It seemed itself to be of small
size and dim, but the brightness which was produced by it
was very brilliant, and a train of light, just like a large beam,
darted from the east and north into the star. Some affirmed
that, at this period, they had seen more stars of unusual ap-
pearance. On the day of our Lord's Supper were seen two
moons, shortly before daybreak, one in the east, the other in
the west, both of them full ; the same day being the fourteenth
day of the moon.

In this year there was a shocking quarrel between Henry,
emperor of Germany, and his son Henry; so much so, that
they met in battle, and the father was slain by the son, after
having reigned fifty years ; upon which he was succeeded by
his son the above-named Henry. Before the month of August,
Henry, king of the English, crossed the sea and went to Nor-
mandy, on which nearly all the chief men of the Normans made
submission to him, with the exception of Robert de Belesme
and William de Mortaigne, and a few others, who adhered to
duke Robert. At the Assumption of Saint Mary, Henry, king
of the English, came to Bee, where he and archbishop Anselm
holding a conference, became reconciled ; and not long after, by
the command and request of the king, the said archbishop
returned to England. After this, the king assembled his army,
and proceeding to a certain castle of the earl of Mortaigne,
which is called Tenchebrai, laid siege to it. In the mean-
time, while the king was thus engaged, his brother Robert
came upon him with his army, on the vigil of Saint Michael, 4 *
and with him Robert de Belesme and William, earl of Mor-
taigne. A battle then taking place, king Henry gained the
victory. On this occasion Robert, duke of Normandy, Wil-
liam, earl of Mortaigne, and Robert de Stuteville, with Wil-
liam Crispin and many others, were taken prisoners, while
Robert de Belesme escaped by flight. In consequence of this
success, king Henry subdued the whole of Normandy, and
rendered it subject to his will, informing archbishop Anselm
thereof by letter.

In the year 1108, Edgar, king of the Scots, departed this
life, on the sixth day before the ides of January, and was
succeeded by his brother Alexander. Normandy having now

been reduced to subjection by the king, Eobert, duke of Nor-
mandy, and William, earl of Mortaigue, being first sent over
to England as prisoners, the king himself returned to his king-
dom before Easter. On the calends of August there was a
meeting held at London of all the bishops, abbats, and nobles
of the kingdom ; and, during three days, in the absence of
archbishop Anselm, there was a full discussion held between
the king and the bishops upon the investitures of churches.
Some of them urged, that the king ought to make them after
the example of his father and brother, and not according to the
precepts of and in obedience to the successor of the Apostles.
But pope Paschal, standing firm in the opinion which had been
promulgated from the papal chair, had conceded everything 45
which pope Urban had forbidden to be received as investi-
tures, and by these means had made the king agree in his
view on the subject of investiture.

After this, in the presence of Anselm, a great multitude
being present, the king asserted and decreed that, from that
time forward, no person should ever be invested in a bishopric
or abbey by the king, or by any lay hand, in England, by the
gift of the pastoral staff or of the ring ; while Anselm conceded,
that no person elected to a prelacy should be refused conse-
cration to the dignity so received by reason of the homage
which he should perform to the king. Gerard, archbishop of

45 This passage, which might seem somewhat obscure, is probably explain-
ed by the more full account given by Roger of Wendover of what passed
when Anselm and the deposed abbats appeared before the pope. " Pope
Paschal received Anselm kindly ; and, on a day appointed, William de
Warewast, clerk and proctor for the king of England, brought forward
his cause, and, amongst other things, firmly asserted that he would never
resign the investiture of churches, even if he were to lose his kingdom,
and confirmed this assertion with words of threatening import. To this
the pope replied, ' If, as you say, your king would not give up the
donation of churches to save his kingdom, neither would I, to save my life
let him keep it.' Thus the king's business terminated, and archbishop
Anselm began to intercede with the pope for the degraded bishops and
abbats, that he would give them a dispensation to recover their lost dig-
nities. Then the Holy See, which is never wanting to any one, if any-
thing of a white or red colour passes between the parties, manfully restored
the aforesaid bishops and abbats to their former dignities, and sent them
back with joy to their own habitations." The allusion to the white or
red colour refers to the power of silver or gold at the papal court, which
was then open to great corruption.

York, placing Ms hand in the hand of Anselm, as he himself
desired, promised, upon his faith, that he would pay the same
obedience and be in the same subjection to him and his suc-
cessors in the archbishopric, as he had promised to him when
about to be consecrated by him to the see of Hereford.

Walter Giffard, bishop elect of Winchester, Roger of Salis-
bury, Reinelm of Hereford, William of Exeter, and Urban
of Glamorgan, in Wales, came to Canterbury at the same time,
and were consecrated together by Anselm, on the third day
before the ides of August, being the Lord's day, the following
suffragans of his province assisting him in his duties : Ge-
rard, archbishop of York, Robert, bishop of Lincoln, John,
bishop of Bath, Herbert, bishop of Norwich, Robert, bishop of
Chester, Ralph, bishop of Chichester, and Ranulph, bishop ot
Durham. There was no one then living, who could remember in
past times so many pastors being elected and consecrated at
one time in England, except in the days of Edward the Elder,
when archbishop Plegmund consecrated seven bishops to seven
churches in one day.

In the same year, Maurice, bishop of London, Richard, ab-
bat of Ely, Robert, abbat of Saint Edmund's, Milo Crispin,
Robert Fitz-Haimon, Roger Bigot, and Richard de Rivers
departed this life.

In the year 1108, Gundulph, bishop of Rochester, died on
the nones of March. Henry, king of the English, for the pur-
pose of protection, enacted a law that, if any one should be
detected in the act of theft or larceny, he should be hanged.
He also enacted that base and spurious coin should be guarded
against with such strictness, that whosoever should be detected
coining spurious money, should lose his eyes and the lower
part of his body without any ransom ; and, inasmuch as,
very frequently, while pennies were being coined, 46 they were
bent, or broken, and then rejected, he ordered that no penny
or obol, 47 which he also ordered to be made of a round form,
or even farthing, if it was a good one, should be rejected.
From this provision much good resulted to the whole king-

dom, because the king thus exerted himself in secular matters
to retrieve the troubles of the land.

In this year, Gerard, archbishop of York, departed this
life, in whose place was elected Thomas, the cousin of
Thomas, his predecessor. Philip, king of the Franks, de-
parted this life, and was succeeded by his son Louis. Arch-
bishop Anselm, at the king's request, consecrated Eichard, the
bishop of London elect, in his chapel at Paggaham, being as-
sisted in the performance of this duty by William, bishop of
Winchester, Roger, bishop of" Salisbury, Ralph, bishop of
Chichester, and WilHam, bishop of Exeter, having first re-
ceived from him the usual profession of obedience and subjec-
tion. After this, coming to Canterbury on the third day be-
fore the ides of August, he consecrated Ralph, abbat of Seez,
a religious man, bishop of Rochester, in succession to Gun-
dulph, William, bishop of Winchester, Ralph, bishop of Chi-
chester, and Richard, bishop of London, assisting him in the
performance of that duty; which same Richard, after the
custom of his predecessors, on the same day presented a hand-
some gift to his mother church of Canterbury.

These are the provisions relative to archdeacons, priests,
deacons, subdeacons, and secular clergy of whatever degree,
which, in the year of our Lord's Incarnation 1108, Anselm,
archbishop of Canterbury, and Thomas, archbishop elect
of York, and all the other bishops of England, in the pre-
sence of the glorious king Henry, with the assent of his
earls and barons, enacted : " It is hereby decreed, that
priests, deacons, and subdeacons, shall live in chastity, and
shall have no women in their houses save only those who are
connected with them by close relationship, according to the
rulo which the holy Synod of Nice has laid down. But those
priests, deacons, and subdeacons who have, since the prohibi-
tion pronounced by the synod held in London, either retained
their wives or married others, if they wish any longer to
celebrate the mass, let them so entirely put them away from
themselves as not to let them enter their houses ; nor are they
themselves to go into the houses of such women, or knowingly
to meet them in any house ; nor are any women of this descrip-
tion to live upon lands belonging to the church. But if for any
proper reason it is necessary for either party to communicate
with the other, having two lawful witnesses, let them converse

together outside of the house. And if, upon the testimony of
two or three lawful witnesses, or by the public report of the
people of the parish, any one of them shall be accused of having
violated this enactment, he shall clear himself, if he is a priest,
by bringing six proper witnesses of his own order ; if a deacon,
four ; if a subdeacon, two. But as for him, who shall not thus
clear himself, he shall be deemed to be a transgressor of this
holy enactment. And as for those priests who, despising the
divine altar and the holy canons, have preferred to live with
women, let them be removed from the holy office, deprived
of all ecclesiastical benefices, and placed without the choir,
being pronounced infamous ; and he who, being a rebel and con-
tumacious, shall not leave the woman, and shall presume to
celebrate the mass, if, when called upon to make satisfaction,
he shall neglect to do so, is to be excommunicated. The same
sentence embraces the archdeacons and all the secular clergy,
both as to leaving these women and avoiding cohabitation with
them, and the severity of the punishment if they shall trans-
gress these statutes. All archdeacons shall also swear that they
will not receive money for tolerating the transgression of
this enactment, nor suffer priests whom they know to be
keeping women to chaunt the mass, or to have substitutes ; 48
deans also shall swear to the same effect. The -archdeacon, or
deacon, or dean, who shall refuse to take oath to this effect,
is to lose his archdeaconry or deanery. As to those priests,
who, leaving the women, shall make choice to serve God and
the holy altars, let them cease during forty days from the per-
formance of their duties, and in the meantime employ sub-
stitutes in their places, such penance being imposed on them
as to their bishops shall seem fit."

In the year 1109, Anselm, archbishop of Canterbury, de-
parted this life at Canterbury, on the eleventh day before
the calends of May, being the fourth day of the week, and on
the following day, which was the Supper of the Lord, was
buried with great honor. About the time of the Rogation
Days, Henry, king of the English, returned to England, and
at Pentecost held his court at Westminster ; where Thomas,
archbishop elect of York, was consecrated at London, 48 * on the
fifth day before the calends of July, by Richard, bishop of

London, and afterwards on the calends of August, being
Sunday, received, at York, from the hands of Cardinal Ulric,
the pall which the pope had sent him, and on the same
day consecrated Turgot, prior of Durham, to the bishopric
of Saint Andrew's in Scotland, which is called Cenrimunt.
In the same year, king Henry changed the abbacy of Ely
into an episcopal see, and made Hervey, bishop of Bangor,
bishop of that see. In the month of December a comet was
seen, near the milky circle, making its way with its train
towards the southern part of the heavens.

In the year 1110, Henry, king of the English, gave his daugh-
ter in marriage to Henry, king of Germany. In the same
year, different prodigies appeared throughout England. A very
great earthquake took place at Shrewsbury. The river at
Nottingham, which is called the Trent, was dried up for the
space of a mile from morning until the third hour of the
day, so much so, that men walked with dry feet upon its bed.
On the sixth day before the ides of July, a comet appeared,
and was seen to shine for a period of three weeks.

In the year 1111, Henry, king of Germany, came to Rome,
and taking pope Paschal prisoner, placed him in confinement,
but shortly after, when they were celebrating the festival of
Easter on the Campus Martius at the bridge on the Salarian
road, 49 was reconciled to him. In this year died Baldwin,
earl of Flanders, and was succeeded by his son Baldwin.
Henry, king of the English, removed the people of Flanders
who inhabited Northumbria, with all their chattels into Wales,
and gave them orders to colonize the district which bears the
name of Ros. 50

The new monastery which had been built within the walls
f Winchester, through the influence of William, bishop of
Winchester the king ordered to be rebuilt without the walls,
and shortly after crossed the sea.

In the same year there was a most severe winter, a dread-
ful famine, a plague among men, and a murrain among animals,
both wild and domestic ; there was also a very great mortality
among birds.

In the year 1112, on the third day before the nones of May,
being Sunday, Samson, the twenty-fifth bishop 51 of Worcester,
departed this life. In October, Henry, king of the English,
placed earl Robert de Belesme in confinement at Cherburg.

In the year 1113, the city of Worcester was, on the calends
of July, destroyed by fire, with the principal church and all
the others, and the castle. One of the monks, a person of the
greatest utility to the monastery, together with two servants
and fifteen citizens, perished in the flames. In the month of
July, Henry, king of the English, returned to England, and
bringing with him earl Robert de Belesme from Normandy,
placed him in close custody at Wareham. On the fourth day
before the nones of October, two men of exemplary virtue
departed this life ; Thomas, the prior, and Coleman, a monk, of
the venerable church of Saint Mary at Worcester, men of noble
extraction. On the fifth day before the calends of January,
being the Lord's day, Teulph, the king's chaplain, received the
bishopric of Worcester at Windsor.

In the year 1114, on the eighth day before the ides of
January, Matilda, daughter of Henry, king of the English,
was married to Henry, the emperor of the Romans, at Mentz,
and consecrated empress. On the sixth day before the calends
of March, being the third day of the week, Thomas the
Younger, archbishop of York, departed this life. When he
was first taken ill, his medical men told him that he could
not recover, except by means of carnal knowledge of a woman ;
on which he made answer, " Shame upon a malady which
requires sensuality for its cure !" and being thus chosen by the
Lord while of virgin purity closed his temporal life. On the
sixth day before the calends of May, being the Lord's day,
Ralph, bishop of Rochester, was elected at Windsor arch-
bishop of Canterbury. On the third day before the nones of
May, being the third day of the week, the city of Chichester,
together with the principal monastery, was, through culpable
carelessness, destroyed by fire.

On the day of the Assumption of Saint Mary, Turstin, the
king's chaplain, was, at Winchester, elected to the archbishopric
of York, and Arnulph, abbat of Burgh, was chosen bishop of
Hereford. Henry, king of the English, after leading an
army into Wales, before the feast of Saint Michael crossed the

sea. In this year, the river which hears the name of Medway,
for a distance of some miles, receded so far from its hed, on
the sixth day before the ides of October, that in the very mid-
dle of it not even the smallest vessel could make the slightest
way. On the same day, the river Thames was also sensible of
a similar decrease ; for between the bridge and the royal tower, 83
and even under the bridge, so greatly was the water of the
river diminished, that an innumerable multitude of men and
boys forded it on foot, the water scarcely reaching to their
knees. This ebb of the tide continued from the middle of the
preceding night until dark on the following night. We have
heard also on good authority that on the same day a similar
low tide happened at Girvemuthe 53 and other places throughout
England.

In the year 1115, there was a most severe winter, so much
so, that nearly all the bridges throughout England were broken
by the ice. The emperor Henry, after besieging the city
of Cologne and losing many of his men in a pitched battle,
made peace, which he ratified by oath at the city of Neuss. 54
On the fifth day before the calends of July, being the Lord's
day, Ealph, archbishop of Canterbury, received the pall
from Anselm, 55 the legate of the holy Roman Church, at Canter-
bury, and on the same day was consecrated with great honor ;
at which place, also, were assembled the bishops of the whole
of England. Teulph, bishop of Worcester, departed this life,
and was succeeded by Wilfrid, bishop of Saint David's, in
Wales ; up to this time, the bishops of that see had been
Welchmen, but he was succeeded by Barnard, the queen's
chancellor. On the octave of the Apostles Saint Peter and Paul,
a great council, was held at Chalons, by Conon, a cardinal of the
Eoman church, at which he excommunicated those bishops who
were not present at the council, and degraded some ; some
abbats also he deprived of their staffs and removed from
their offices, forbidding them the performance of ecclesiastical
duties.

and afterwards bishop of the Scots, 56 having returned to Durham,
there departed this Hfe. About the period of the feast of All
Saints, Reinelm, bishop of Hereford, died, and was succeeded
by Gosfrid, the king's chaplain. On the day of Saint Stephen
the Martyr, Ralph, archbishop of Canterbury, ordained at
that place Arnulph, abbat of Burgh, bishop of Rochester,
and Gosfrid, the king's chaplain, bishop of Hereford.

In the year 1116, during the spring, Griffin, the son of
Rees, 56 * carried off considerable booty into Wales, and burned
some castles, in consequence of which, Henry, king of
England, was unwilling to allow him to possess a particle of
the lands of his father. On the fourteenth day before the
calends of April, the earls and barons of the whole of England
met at Salisbury. Here a trial took place relative to a dis-
pute which had continued during a whole year, between
Ralph, archbishop of Canterbury, and Turstin, archbishop
elect of York. The latter, on being requested by the arch-
bishop to do what was his duty to the church of Canterbury,
and after the ecclesiastical usage, receive his benediction, made
answer that he would willingly receive the benediction, but
would on no account make the profession 58 which he required.
On this, king Henry, perceiving that Turstin persisted in his
obstinacy, openly protested that he must act after the manner
of his predecessors, both as to making the profession, as also in
other matters pertaining to the dignity of the church of
Canterbury of ancient right, or else give up the archbishopric
of York altogether, as well as the benediction ; on hearing
which, without previous consideration, Turstin renounced the
archbishopric, and promised the king and the archbishop that he
would not claim it again as long as he lived, nor would make
any charge relative thereto, whoever might be substituted
in his place.

At this time, Owen, king of the Welch, was slain. Henry,
king of the English, crossed the sea. attended by Turstin,
the archbishop elect of York, who hoped to obtain re-instal-
ment into the see, and by the king's command receive the
benediction from the archbishop, without the profession being
exacted of him. The above-named Anselm, the legate of
the Roman church who had brought the pall from Rome to the
archbishop of Canterbury, returned from Rome about the month

of August, and came to Normandy to king Henry, bringing
letters from the successor of the Apostles, which directed him
to act in England on behalf of the Apostolic see. This being
soon spread abroad throughout the whole of England, by the
advice of the queen and some of the nobles, Ralph, the arch-
bishop of Canterbury, after the nativity of Saint Mary, crossed
the sea, and went to the king whom he found staying at
Rouen, and after having carefully conferred with him on the
business on which he had come, taking each matter in its
proper order, by the king's advice set out on his way to Rome.

In the year 1117, by the command of king Henry, the new
works at Cirencester were begun. In Lombardy, a great
earthquake took place, and, according to the testimony of those
who knew the fact, lasted for a period of forty days, during
which time many buildings fell to the ground ; and, a thing
marvellous to be seen and spoken of, a certain town, of
very considerable magnitude, was suddenly moved from its
original site, and is at the present day to be seen by all at a
place far distant. While some men of patrician rank at
Milan were discoursing on matters of state, sitting beneath a
certain tower, a voice from outside resounded in the ears of
all, calling one of them by name, and begging him to come
out immediately ; on his delaying, a person appeared, and
with entreaties, begged the man who had been called, to come
forth ; on doing which, the tower was suddenly overthrown, and
in its dreadful fall buried all who were there.

On the calends of December, there was great thunder and
lightning, which was followed by a vast deluge of rain and
hail ; on the third day before the ides of the same month, the
moon appeared at first of the colour of blood, after which it
became overshadowed. Robert, bishop of Chester, died.
' In the year 1118, pope Paschal of holy memory departed
this life, on the fourteenth day before the calends of February ;
and in his place was appointed one John, a native of Gaeta,
who, changing his name, was called Gelasius. From his in-
fancy he had been brought up as a monk, at the monastery of
Monte Casino, and after he had grown up had assiduously
fulfilled the duties of chancellor, during the ministration of
the venerable successors of the Apostles, Desiderius, Urban,
and Paschal.

Henry, king of Germany, who was also emperor of Rome,

on hearing that the pope was dead, flew to Rome, and nomi-
nated the bishop of Braga, who had been excommunicated at
Beneventum by the same pope the previous year, to be pope,
changing his name from Bourdin to Gregory ; on which Gelasius
retired from the city. On the day before the calends of May,
Matilda, queen of the English, departed this life at West-
minster, and was becomingly buried at the monastery there.
At this period, many of the Normans, forsaking the fealty
which they had sworn to king Henry, and having no fear of
retribution, betook themselves to Louis, king of the Franks
and his principal men, who were the enemies of their natural
lord. In this year died Robert, earl of Mellent.

The above-named pope Gelasius came by sea to Burgundy,
and his arrival soon became known throughout Gaul. On
the seventeenth day before the calends of February, he sent
a letter throughout Gaul to the archbishops, bishops, abbats,
secular clergy, and principal men, complaining that he had
been expelled with violence by the emperor from Home, and
that the bishop of Braga, an excommunicated person, had been
thrust into the Apostolic See ; at the same time, exhorting
them to prepare themselves by their assistance in common to
avenge the cause of the mother Church. These letters hav-
ing been circulated throughout the provinces, all the men
of influence were aroused, together with the middle classes,
to go to meet the successor of the Apostles, and prepared
with every possible effort to be present at the council, which
he declared he would hold at Rheims at the time of Mid-Lent.

In this year, a certain church having been dedicated at a
town in England, called Momerfield, by Geoffrey, bishop of
Hereford, as the people were returning home who had at-
tended the dedication, after the serenity of the weather
which had previously prevailed, on a sudden a most vio-
lent tempest arose, attended with thunder ; some persons
were struck with lightning and perished, while unable to
get away from a place in which they had taken shelter.
They were five in number, namely, three men and two
women, one of which last was struck by a thunderbolt and
killed, while the other woman was shockingly smitten from
the navel down to the soles of her feet, and perished, enveloped
in flames ; the men alone with difficulty escaped with their
lives, while their five horses were destroyed by the lightning.



A.D. 1119. COUNCIL AT KHEIMS. 209

In the year 1119, pope Gelasius died at Clugny, and was
buried there ; and in his place the cardinals and other Ro-
mans who had followed him, elected Guido, archbishop of
Vienna, and gave him the name of Calixtus. While these
transactions were going on in Burgundy, the Apostolate of the
Roman Church was administered by the above-named Gregory.
In consequence of the elevation of these two to the papacy,
the world was shaken and divided into two factions, some
giving their adhesion to the one, and some to the other ; by
reason whereof, the church was stricken with great scandal.
On the fourth day before the nones of February, Geoffrey,
bishop of Hereford, and, on the tenth day before the calends
of September, Herbert, bishop of Norwich, departed this life.
On the fourth day before the calends of October, being the
Lord's day, at about the third hour of the day, a great earth-
quake took place at many places throughout England.

On the thirteenth day before the calends of November,
'pope Calixtus held a general council at Rheims ; at this council
there was a vast concourse of archbishops, bishops, abbats,
and chief men of the various provinces, together with an im-
mense multitude of the clergy and common people. There
were counted there four hundred and twenty-four staffs of
persons with pastoral honors ; among whom was Turstin, the
archbishop elect of York, who having with difficulty obtained
the king's permission, had come thither in reference to his own
business. But the king had previously sent his ambassador
to the successor of the Apostles, for the purpose of telling him,
among other things, not to consecrate the archbishop elect
of York, or command or allow him to be consecrated by any
other person than the archbishop of Canterbury, as used to be
the custom. In answer to which, the successor of the Apostles
replied : " Let not the king imagine that I would act in rela-
tion to the matter upon which he treats in any other way
than he wishes, even though his request should be an un-
reasonable one : nor, indeed, has my inclination ever led me
to wish to debase the ancient dignity of the church of Canter-
bury."

Moreover, on the morning of the Lord's day preceding
the day of the appointed council, Turstin, having made
preparations for his consecration to the archbishopric, the
deputies of the archbishop of Canterbury charged that his

VOL. i. p



210 ANNALS OF SOGEE DE H.OVEDEN. A.D. 1119.

consecration ought to be performed by the archbishop of Can-
terbury, according as the ancient usage and that observed up
to the present time required ; in answer to which, the succes-
sor of the Apostles replied : " It is our wish to do no injustice
to the church of Canterbury, but maintaining its dignity, we
will do that which we purpose." Nevertheless, Turstin was
consecrated by the successor of the Apostles, Ranulph, the bishop
of Durham, who had been sent by the king to prevent his
consecration, not having yet arrived; he, however, arrived
some time after.

On the following day the council was held, and all persons
taking their seats in the order of their ecclesiastical rank, and
Louis, king of the Franks, and many other men of the highest
station being there seated, by the consent of all the fathers, the
statutes of enactment and of prohibition 59 were renewed, of
which these are the five heads. "The laws which, by the sanction
of the holy fathers, have been established in relation to simo-
niacal sin, Ave do also, by the judgment of the Holy Ghost and
the authority of the Apostolic See, confirm. If any one there-
fore, shall, either by himself or by any person suborned there-
to, buy or sell any bishopric, abbacy, priory, archdeaconry,
presbytery, provostship, prebend, altar, or any ecclesiastical
benefices, dignities, ordinations, consecrations, dedications of
churches, clerical tonsure, seat in the choir, or any eccle-
siastical duties, let both seller and buyer be subject to the
peril of losing their dignities, offices, and benefices ; and,
unless he shall repent, let him be pierced by the point of
anathema, and in every way cut off from the church of God,
which he has injured. The investiture of bishoprics, abba-
cies, or any ecclesiactical possessions whatsoever, we do utterly
forbid to be performed by lay hands ; whoever, therefore, of
the laity shall henceforth presume to give investiture, let him
be subject to the penalties of anathema : and further, let him
who has received such investiture be utterly, without hope of
recovery thereof, deprived of the honor with which he has been
invested. The universal possessions of the churches we do
decree to be unshaken and inviolate for everlasting. But if any
one shall take them away, or seize them, or by tyrannical power
withhold the same, let him be smitten everlastingly with
anathema, according to that decree of Saint Symmachus, which
69 " Statuta de statuendis, et rescidenda de rescidendis."



A. D. 1119. THE EMPERORS CONTEST WITH THE POPE. 211

begins, ' Let no bishop, no priest, no member of the clergy
whatsoever, part with ecclesiastical dignities or benefices to
any one, as though of hereditary right.' This, also, we do
enjoin in addition thereto, that no payment shall be demanded
for receiving baptism, chrism, holy oil, and burial. To priests,
deacons, and subdeacons, we do utterly forbid the society
of wives and concubines. And if any persons of this cha-
racter shall be found, let them be deprived both of their
ecclesiastical offices and benefices ; and if they do not even
then correct their uncleanness, let them be deprived of all
communion with Christians." 60

These decrees were sent to the emperor Henry, as he was
not far distant, first from the council by persons of rank, and
then by the successor of the Apostles himself, in order that, be-
fore the breaking up of the council, it might be ascertained
whether, in the churches throughout his kingdom and each
province subject to him, he would consent to canonical elec-
tions, that is to say, bishops and abbats being chosen by
the church ; and whether, to free consecrations, as is the case
where those who are elected are consecrated where and by
whom it is befitting; 61 and whether he would also consent
that no lay person whatsoever should claim a right to the inves-
titure in ecclesiastical matters, so that those elected might,
through investiture with the pastoral staff and ring, enter
through the door, that is, through Christ.

To these requests he made answer, that he would give up
none of these particulars that belonged to him of right, and
which the ancient customs of his ancestors had conferred upon
him. At length, however, being prevailed upon by the authority
of the general council, he conceded the first three points ; but
the last, namely, the right of investiture in ecclesiastical matters,
he would not concede ; in consequence of which, on the pope
returning to the council, sentence of excommunication was
pronounced against him. Some who were present at the
council being indignant at this, the successor of the Apostles
gave his commands that those who were offended thereat,
should go forth and separate themselves from the society of
their brethren, quoting the example of those seventy who,
being offended as to eating the flesh of our Lord and

60 Under the penalties of anathema.

drinking his blood, 62 returned home, and no longer walked
with him; and " inasmuch as," he said, "he who gathereth
not with the Lord, scattereth ; and he who is not with him,
is against him, and that tunic which is not sewn together
but woven, namely, the Holy Church, those who think
with us are unwilling to have rent asunder, while those who
differ from us are striving to rend it asunder." The successor
of the Apostles having spoken to this effect, forthwith all
were brought round to the same opinion, and sentence of ex-
communication was fulminated against the emperor Henry.

At length, some days after the council had broken up, Henry,
king of the English, being offended at archbishop Turstin,
because he had caused himself to be consecrated without his
consent, and not in the way that ancient usage required, for-
bade him to return to any place in his dominions. After this,
pope Calixtus came to Gisors, where the king of the English
came to meet him, for the purpose of holding a conference.
Many things were treated of between them, on account of
which it was right that such great personages should meet ; and,
among the rest, the king obtained the pope's consent that he
would grant him all the liberties his father had possessed in
England and Normandy, and especially that he would allow no
one to fill the office of legate at any time in England, unless
he himself (on any important difference arising which could
not be put an end to by the bishops of his kingdom) requested
this to be done by the pope. All these points being settled for
the present, the pope requested the king to become reconciled
to Turstin, and in consideration of his love towards himself,
his restoration to the archbishopric to which he himself
had consecrated him. But the king confessed that he had
vowed upon his faith that he would not do so, as long as he
lived ; to which the pope made reply : "I am the successor
of the Apostles, and, if you do what I ask, will release you
from the stringency of this oath." " I will discuss the
matter," said the king, "and notify to you the result of
my determination." Upon this, the pope withdrew, and
the king, by messengers, gave him this answer upon the
subject : "I will admit Turstin to the archbishopric upon
condition, that he pay that obedience to the church of Canter-
bury which his predecessors did, otherwise, so long as I reign,
62 In allusion to St. John, vi. 66.



A.D. 1120. HOMAGE PAID TO HENBY's S03T. 213

he shall not preside over the see of York." Matters being
thus concluded, the successor of the Apostles took his depar-
ture, and Turstin remained in France.

William, the son of king Henry and queen Matilda, a youth
seventeen years of age, this year took to wife the daughter of
the earl of Anjou. Baldwin, earl of Flanders, died of the effects
of a wound which he had received at Eu.

In the year 1120, Henry, king of the English, and Louis,
king of the Franks, after many losses on both sides, on a day
appointed, held a conference ; at which, peace having been
made by mutual consent, by the command of king Henry, his
son, William, did homage to the king of the Franks, and
received under him the principality of Normandy ; and thus,
the kings departing in peace, the whole of the seditions which
had raged throughout Normandy were suppressed, and those
who had raised their arms against their lord, king Henry,
having bowed their necks to his dominion, returned to obe-
dience. And, inasmuch as archbishop Turstin had shown
himself both vigilant and active in effecting a reconciliation
between the kings, in consequence of his usefulness, he ren-
dered the king's feelings more inclined to sanction his return.
In addition to this, as the king was preparing to return to
England, a letter came directed to him from the successor of
the Apostles, enjoining him to receive archbishop Turstin,
and. all other pretexts and excuses set aside, to restore him to
his see. But in reply to this precept, the king deferred until
his return to England what answer to give, in order that,
having assembled his council there, he might consider with
more mature deliberation what was to be done.

By the king's command, the chief men of Normandy did
komage to his son William, a youth then just eighteen years
of age ; they also swore fealty to him, confirming it by oath.
After this, all who had rebelled against him being either con-
quered or reconciled, and every thing prosperously concluded
according to his wish, the fifth year after he had gone thither
being not yet completed, the king returned to England by ship
in better spirits than usual. To his son and all his retinue he had
given a ship, a better one than which there did not seem to be
in all the fleet, but as the event proved, there was not one more
unfortunate ; for while his father preceded him, the son fol-
lowed somewhat more tardily, but with a still more unhappy

result. For the ship, when not far from land, while in full sail,
was driven upon the rocks which are called Chaterase, and
being wrecked, the king's son, with all who were with him,
perished on the sixth day before the calends of December,
being the fifth day of the week, at nightfall, near Barbeflet. 63
In the morning, the king's treasures which were on board the
ship, were found on the sands, but none of the bodies of
those lost.

There perished with the king's son, his illegitimate brother,
earl Eichard, together with the king's daughter, 64 the wife of
Rotrou ; Richard, earl of Chester, with his wife, the king's
niece, and sister of earl Tedbald, the king's nephew. There
also perished Othoel, the governor of the king's son, Geof-
frey Riddell, Robert Maldint, 65 William Bigot, and many other
men of rank ; also several noble women with no small num-
ber of the king's children ; besides one hundred and forty sol-
diers, with fifty sailors and three pilots. A certain butcher was
the only person who made his escape, by clinging to a plank
of the wrecked vessel. The king having had a fair voyage,
on reaching England, thought that his son had entered some
other port ; but on the third day he was afflicted with the sad
tidings of his death, and at first, from the suddenness of the
calamity, fainted away, as though a person of weak mind ;
but afterwards, concealing his grief, in contempt of fortune he
resumed his kingly spirits For this son being the only one
left him by lawful wedlock, he had named him heir to the
kingdom in succession to himself.

In the year 1121, at the Purification of Saint Mary, having
assembled the council of the whole of England at Windsor,
Henry, king of the English, took in marriage Adeline, the
daughter of Godfrey, duke of Lorraine. Richard, the king's
chaplain, was elected bishop of Hereford, and Robert Peche, 66
another royal chaplain, bishop of Coventry. Herbert, almo-
ner of Saint Peter's at Westminster, was chosen abbat of that
place. Edwin, a monk of the church of Canterbury, having
been elected in the preceding year bishop of Saint Andrew's
in Scotland, gave up his intention of ruling that see and re-

turned to his former place. William Deschapelles, bishop of
Chalons, departed this life on the fifteenth day before the
calends of February, having assumed the monastic habit eight
days before his death.

There came a letter from pope Calixtus, relative to Tur-
stin, directed to king Henry and Ralph, archbishop of Canter-
bury, in which he interdicted the latter from all sacerdotal and
episcopal duties; and both in the mother church of Canterbury,
and in the principal church at York, together with its provinces,
forbade the celebration of all divine offices together with the
burial of the dead, except the baptism of infants and the abso-
lution of the dying, 67 unless within one month after the re-
ceipt of that letter, Turstin should be, without exacting the
profession of obedience, restored to his archbishopric.

In the same year, after Easter, pope Calixtus departed from
the city with a large body of men, and besieged the city of
Sutri, until he took both Bourdin the anti-pope and the place
itself, as the subjoined letter will more plainly show.

"Calixtus the bishop, servant of the servants of God, to his
dearly beloved brethren and sons, the archbishops, bishops, ab-
bats, priors, and others, both clergy and laity, the faithful ser-
vants of Saint Peter throughout the Gauls, health, and the
apostolic benediction. Because the people have forsaken the law
of the Lord, and walk not in his judgments, the Lord visits their
iniquities with a rod, and their sins with stripes. But retain-
ing the bowels of paternal affection, those who put trust in his
mercy he does not repel ; though for a long time, their sins
so requiring, the faithful of the church have been disturbed
by Bourdin, that idol of the king of Germany ; some indeed
have been taken captives, and others through starvation in
f rison have been afflicted unto death. Lately, however, after
celebrating the feast of Easter, when we could no longer pas-
sively endure the complaints of the pilgrims and of the poor,
we left the city with the faithful servants of the church, and
laid siege to Sutri, until the Divine power delivered the before-
named Bourdin, the enemy of the church, who had there made a
nest for the devil, as well as the place itself, entirely into our
hands. We beg your brotherly love therefore, with us to
return thanks to the King of kings for benefits so great, and

administration of the " viaticum."

that you will remain most firmly in your obedience to the Ca-
tholic church, and in your duty to God, as you will receive
from Almighty God, through His grace, the recompense for so
doing, both here and hereafter. We beg also, that this our
letter be sent from one to the other, all negligence laid aside.
Done at Sutri, on the fifth day before the calends of May."

In this year, the daughter of Fulk, earl of Anjou, for-
merly the wife of William the son of king Henry, who had
been drowned, was, at the request of her father, sent back
by the king to her own country. The sons of the king
of the Welch, on hearing of the death of Richard earl of
Chester, burning two castles and slaying many men, laid
waste, with great ravages, some places in that earldom. King
Henry, being indignant at this, having levied an innumerable
army throughout all England, marched for the purpose of
ravaging Wales ; but, on his arrival at Snawedun, 68 the king
of the Welch was reconciled to the king, appeasing him by
presents and hostages, and, shortly after, the army returned
home. At this period, king Henry having, by digging, made
a long trench from Torkesey as far as Lincoln, by turning into
it the river Trent made a passage for shipping. Ranulph,
bishop of Durham, also began a castle at Norham, on the banks
of the river Tweed. On the vigil of the Nativity of our
Lord, an unusual wind blew down not only houses, but even
towers built of stone.

In the year 1 122, king Henry was at Windsor during the
festival of the Nativity, at Easter, at Northampton, and during
Pentecost, at Windsor ; whence he proceeded to London and
Kent, and afterwards to Durham, in Northumbria. In the
same year, died Ralph, archbishop of Canterbury, and John,
bishop of Bath.

In the year 1123, during the festival of the Nativity, king
Henry was at Dunstable, and thence proceeded to Berkhamp-
stead. Here, a certain chancellor of the king, Ranulph by
name, who had been afflicted with a malady for twenty years,
but who had always gloried at court in his wickedness, being
ready for all crimes, oppressing the innocent, and plundering
the lands of many, while escorting the king to entertain
him at his house, on coming to the top of a hill whence his
castle could be seen, was so elated in spirits that he fell off
68 The mountain of Snowdon.

his horse, and a monk galloped over him ; 69 in consequence
of which he was so crushed that he ended his life in a few
days. The king went thence attended by Robert, bishop of
Lincoln, on his road to Woodstock ; where the bishop being
attacked by a sudden malady, lost his speech, and, being car-
ried to an inn, soon afterwards breathed forth his spirit. 70
This happened on the tenth day of the month of January.

In the year 1124, at the feast of the Purification, the king
gave the archbishopric of Canterbury to William de Curbuil,
prior of the canons of Chiche. 71 After this, at Easter, king
Henry, when at Winchester, gave the bishopric of Lincoln to
Alexander, the nephew of Roger, bishop of Salisbury, justiciary
of all England ; he also gave the bishopric of Bath to Godfrey,
the queen's chancellor, and about Pentecost, crossed the sea ;
on which a dispute arising, the earl of Mellent revolted from
him ; whereupon the king laid siege to his castle, the name of
which is Pontaudemer, and took it.

In the year 1125, great success smiled on the king; for
William de Tankerville, the king's chamberlain, fighting a
pitched battle with him, took the above-named earl of Mel-
lent prisoner, together with Hugh de Montfort, his brother-
in-law, and Hugh FitzGervaise, and delivered them to the
king ; on which he placed them in confinement. In the same
year died Teulph, bishop of Worcester, and Ernulph, bishop
of Rochester.

In the year 1126, king Henry remained during the whole
of the year in Normandy, and there gave the bishopric of
Worcester to Simon, the queen's clerk, and that of Chiches-
ter to Sefrid, abbat of Glastonbury. William, archbishop t>f
69 The corresponding passage in Roger of Wendover's account is :
A monk of St. Alban's, whose lands he had unjustly seized on, involun-
tarily galloped over him."

" This circumstance is mentioned more fully in the Anglo-Saxon
Chronicle. *' It fell out on a Wednesday, being the fourth day before the
ides of January, that the king rode in his deer-park, and Roger, bishop
of Salisbury, was on one side of him, and Robert Bloet, bishop of Lin-
coln, on the other : and they rode there talking. Then the bishop of
Lincoln sank down, and said to the king, ' My lord king, I am dying;'
and the king alighted from his horse and took him between his arms, and
bade them bear him to his inn, and he soon lay there dead."

1118, for canons of the Augustine order, and that there are considerable
remains of it.



218 ANNALS OF EOGEK DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1126.

Canterbury, also gave the bishopric of Rochester to John, his
archdeacon. At Easter, John of Crema, a Roman cardinal, came
over to England, and, after visiting the bishoprics and abbeys,
not without great presents, at the nativity of Saint Mary. held
a solemn synod at London, where a great mishap befell him.

for, having at the synod spoken in the severest terms rela-
tive to the wives of the clergy, saying that it was the greatest
wickedness to arise from the side of a harlot to make the body
of Christ, while he himself had that same day made the
body of Christ, he was, after nightfall, surprised in the com-
pany of a harlot. The thing being thus notorious throughout
London, could not be denied; and thus the great honor in
which he was held everywhere previously, was turned into
the greatest disgrace. He returned home, therefore, by the
judgment of God, in confusion and disgrace.

In the same year died Henry, emperor of the Romans,
son-in-law of Henry, king of the English. But by some it is
alleged that the same emperor, being led by a feeling of peni-
tence for having killed his own father, after having gone on a
certain night, according to his usual custom, to the bed of the
empress Matilda, the daughter of Henry king of the English, the
lights being put out and the servants having withdrawn, re-
tired barefoot and dressed in woollen garments, leaving behind
the imperial vestments, his wife, and his kingdom, and was
never after seen, nor was it discovered what became of him.
On this, the empress, taking with her the uncorrupted hand
of Saint James the Apostle, and the imperial crown, returned
to king Henry, her father. After the decease or departure of
the emperor Henry, Lothaire succeeded to the throne. Henry,
king of the English, being greatly rejoiced at gaining the
hand of Saint James the Apostle, founded the noble abbey
of Reddinges, 72 and enriched it with many valuables, and
placed in it the hand of Saint James the Apostle ; the impe-
rial crown he placed in his own treasury.

The moneyers throughout almost the whole of England
were, by king's order, seized for having secretly debased the
coin, and, their right hands being first cut off, were then deprived
of their virility. In this year there was a great famine, and so
great was the dearness of provisions, that no one in our time

has seen the like, for a horse-load of corn was sold at the price
of six shillings. In this year, also, William, archbishop of
Canterbury, Turstin, archbishop of York, and Alexander, bishop
of Lincoln, went to Rome.

In the year 1127, during the Nativity, and Easter, and
Pentecost, king Henry remained in Normandy, and, having
made an honorable peace with the king of France, before the
feast of Saint Michael this most victorious king returned to
England, and brought with him his daughter the empress, the
widow of so great a man, as previously mentioned. In this
year, also, Robert, bishop of Chester, died.

In the year 1128, at the Nativity, king Henry held his
court at Windsor, and proceeded thence to London. During
Lent and Easter he was at Woodstock, where word was brought
to him that Charles, earl of Flanders, his most beloved friend,
had been, by the basest treachery, slain by his nobles in a
church at Brige, 13 and that the king of France had given
Flanders to William, the son of Robert Curthose, his nephew
and enemy, who, being now firmly established, had punished
all the traitors to Charles with many torments. Accordingly,
the king, being disturbed at these matters, held a council at
London at the time of the Rogation Days ; and, in similar
manner, did archbishoo William do the same at Westminster,
in the same city.

About Pentecost, the king sent his daughter to Normandy,
to be married to Geoffrey, son of the earl of Anjou, and after-
wards, in August, the king himself followed. Richard, bishop
of London, departed this life, and the king gave the bishopric
to Gilbert, a man most learned in all subjects. At this time,
also, died Richard, bishop of Hereford.
* In the year 1129, king Henry, having remained a whole
year in Normandy, marched in a hostile manner into France,
because the king of the Franks was supporting his nephew and
enemy ; and encamping for eight days at Epernon, as securely
as though he had been in his own kingdom, he compelled
king Louis not to give aid to the earl of Flanders. While
here, on enquiring into the origin and career of the kingdom
of the Franks, king Henry was answered by a certain learned
man to the following effect :

" Most powerful among kings, like most of the nations of

Europe, the Franks derive their origin from the Trojans. For
Antenor, flying with his people on the fall of Troy, built a city
in the territories of Pannonia, called Sycambria. After the
death of Antenor, they appointed as their leaders Turgot and
Francion, from whom the Franks derive their name. On
their death, these were succeeded by Marcomer, who was the
father of Pharamond, the first king of the Franks ; Pharamond
begat Clodius Crinitus, 74 from whom the kings of France have
the name of 'Criniti ;' and Clodius was succeeded by Meroveus,
his kinsman, from whom the kings of France received the name
of Merovingians. Meroveus begat Childeric, and he begat
Clodovius, 75 who was baptized by Saint Pvemigius. Clodo-
vius begat Clotaire, who begat Chilperic, and he Clotaire the
Second. Clotaire begat Dagobert, that most famous king,
who begat Clodovius ; by Saint Batilda, his queen, Clodovius
begat three sons, namely, Clotaire, Childeric, and Theoderic.
King Theoderic begat Childebert, and he Dagobert, who begat
Theoderic, the father of Clotaire, the last of this line. In suc-
cession to him reigned Hilderic, who afterwards received the
tonsure, and retired to a monastery, Pepin being made king.
In another genealogical line, by the daughter of king Clotaire
Ansbert begat Arnold, and Saint Arnold Arnulph, afterwards
bishop of Metz. Saint Arnulph begat Anchises, and he Pepin,
the mayor of the palace ; Pepin begat Charles Martel, and he
king Pepin. King Pepin was father of the emperor, Charles
the Great. 76 who shone like a constellation among his prede-
cessors and successors. Charles begat the emperor Louis, and
he the emperor Charles the Bald, and he king Louis, the father
of Charles the Simple. Charles the Simple begat Louis, and
he Lothaire, who begat Louis, the last king of that line. After
his death, the Franks set over themselves duke Hugh, 77 the
son of the great duke Hugh. King Hugh was the father of
Robert, a most pious king, which king Ptobert begat three
sons, Hugh, a most beloved duke, and Henry, a most amiable
king, and Exbert, duke of Burgundy. King Henry was the
father of king Philip, who, at the close of his life, became a

fabulous. Supposing that the Trojan war took place about B.C. 1000,

monk, and of Hugh the Great, who, with the great army of
Christians and many of the chieftains of Europe, laid siege to
Jerusalem, and rescued it from the hands of the pagans. In
the year from the incarnation of our Lord 1129, 78 king Philip
begat Louis, who reigns at the present time ; and if he only
followed in the footsteps of his ancestors, you would not be
remaining so securely in his kingdom." After these things
were said and done, king Henry returned to Normandy.

About this time, a certain duke, Theoderic by name, came
from the parts of Germany to make certain claims upon Flan-
ders, and having with him certain noblemen of that country ;
and this he did at the persuasion of king Henry. "William,
earl of Flanders, having collected an army and set his forces
in battle array, marched against him, and a fierce battle en-
sued. By his invincible prowess, earl "William made up for
the deficiency of his forces, which were few in number. All
his arms being stained with the blood of the enemy, he cleared
the ranks of the foe with his sword like lightning, and, in
consequence, his enemies being unable to bear the terrible
might of his youthful arm, in utter dismay, took to flight.
Thus did the earl gain a complete victory ; but, while he was
besieging a castle 79 of the enemy, and was on the morrow to
receive its surrender, the foe being now almost annihilated,
by the will of God, receiving a slight wound in the hand,
lie died in consequence thereof. This most noble youth, dur-
ing his short life, earned endless glory, and, in his praise, a
poet has said : " Mars has died on earth, the deities bewail a
deity their equal."

This year, also, Hugh de Pains, master of the knights of the
Temple at Jerusalem, came to England, and brought many
with him from Jerusalem ; among whom was Fulk, the bro-
ther of Geoffrey, earl of Anjou, who was destined to be king.
Eanulph Flambard, bishop of Durham, and William Giffard,
bishop of Winchester, departed this life.

In the year 1130, Louis, king of the Franks, caused his
son Philip to be made king ; and king Henry, having made
peace in all parts with France, Flanders, Normandy, Brittany,
Maine, and Anjou, returned in high spirits to England. On the
calends of August, he held a great council at London, on the

subject of prohibiting the priesthood from taking wives. There
were present at this council William, archbishop of Canter-
bury, Turstin, archbishop of York, Alexander, bishop of Lin-
coln, Gilbert, bishop of London, Roger, bishop of Salisbury,
John, bishop of Eochester, Siffrid, bishop of Sussex, 80 Godfrey,
bishop of Bath, Simon, bishop of Worcester, Everard, bishop
of Norwich, Bernard, bishop of Saint David's, and Hervey,
the first bishop of Ely. The bishops of Winchester, Durham,
Chester, and Hereford were absent. These constituted at this
period the pillars of the kingdom, and the rays of its sanc-
tity. But, through the simplicity of archbishop William,
the king deceived them ; for they conceded to the king the
right of administering justice on the question of the wives of
priests ; and were deemed imprudent for so doing, as afterwards
proved to be the fact, when the matter turned out to their
extreme disgrace ; for the king received an endless amount
of money from priests, and then relieved them from the penal-
ties attendant on so doing. Then, but to no purpose, did the
bishops repent of having made this concession, when, before
the eyes of all nations, were made manifest the deception prac-
tised on the prelates, and the oppression of the king's subjects.

In the same year, misfortunes befell those whom Hugh
de Pains, already mentioned, had taken with him to Jeru-
salem ; for, by their sensuality, rapine, and various excesses,
the inhabitants of that holy land had offended the Lord. But, .
as it has been written in the books of Moses and of Kings,
their wickedness in those places did not long remain un-
punished. For, on the vigil of Saint Nicholas, a multitude
of the Christians were overcome by a small number of the
pagans, whereas, previously to that, just the reverse used
to happen. For, at the siege of Damascus, when a great part
of the Christians had gone forth for the purpose of seeking
for provisions, the pagans were astonished at the spectacle
of a multitude of Christians, most valiant men, taking to
flight like women, and, on pursuing them, slew almost count-
less numbers. But those who took refuge in the mountains,
God himself pursued that same night with a tempest, accom-
panied with drifts of snow and cold to such a degree, that
hardly any one escaped.

It also happened that, while the son of the king of the

Franks, who, as previously mentioned, had been graced with
the crown of the kingdom, was sportively spurring on his horse,
he was met by a pig, which, running against the legs of the
horse while in full career, the new-made king fell off, and,
breaking his neck, expired. Consider what a dreadful mishap,
and how deserving of our astonishment ! Behold the loftiness
of his position, and by what trivial means it was annihilated !

In the year of the Word become flesh 1131, being the thir-
teenth year of his reign, king Henry passed the festival of the
Nativity at Worcester, and Easter at Woodstock, where Geof-
frey de Clinton was accused of treason against the king, and dis-
graced. During the Rogation Days, the king was at Canter-
bury, at the dedication of the new church there. At the feast
of Saint Michael, the king went over to Normandy. In the
same year, pope Honorius departed this life, on whose death a
division arose ; for two persons were elected to the papacy of
Rome, Innocent and Anacletus.

In the year 1132, at Chartres, the king acknowledged In-
nocent as pope, and rejected Anacletus ; for the Romans, di-
viding into two factions, had made choice of both of them.
Innocent being violently expelled from the city by Anacletus,
whose previous name was Peter de Leves, was, by the influence
of king Henry, received throughout the whole of the Gauls.
After this, king Henry returned to England, taking with him
his daughter, whom, with the universal consent of the chief
men of the whole of England, he afterwards restored to her
husband, the earl of Anjou, who then demanded her. In
this year died Hervey, bishop of Ely.

In the year 1133, the king passed the festival of the Nati-
vity at Dunstable, and Easter at Woodstock. In the same
year died Baldwin, king of Jerusalem, and was succeeded by
f?ulk, the brother of Geoffrey, earl of Anjou. This Fulk, king of
Jerusalem, had by his wife, the daughter of the above-named
king Baldwin, two sons, namely, Baldwin and Amauri.
Baldwin succeeded his father, Fulk, in the kingdom of Jeru-
salem, and died without issue. After his death, his brother
Amauri succeeded him as king, and reigned eleven years ; he
was the father of Baldwin the Leper, who was afterwards king,
and two daughters, namely, Sibyl and Milicent, of whom fur-
ther mention will be made in the sequel.



224 j4TTNALS OF EOGEE DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1135.

In the year 1134, after Pentecost, Henry, king of England,
gave the bishopric of Ely to Nigel, his treasurer, and that
of Durham to Geoffrey, his chancellor ; the king also created
a new bishopric at Carlisle, arid gave it to Adelulph, the prior
of Saint Oswald. In the same year an eclipse of the sun
took place on the fourth day before the nones of August, at
about the sixth hour of the day, to such a degree, that the
whole of the sun's disk appeared as though covered by a black
shield. That same day, the king, although some opposed it,
fearing danger, and tried to dissuade him from it, crossed the
sea without accident.

In the year 1 1 35, Gilbert, bishop of London, departed this life.
King Henry remained in Normandy in consequence of the joy
he felt on account of his grandsons, whom Geoffrey, earl of An-
jou, had become father of by his daughter, and commanded the
earls and barons of all his dominions to swear fealty to the em-
press Matilda, his daughter, and Henry, her youngest son, naming
him king after himself. After this, king Henry frequently
purposed to return to England, but his daughter, the empress,
detained him in consequence of the various quarrels which, on
many occasions, arose between the king and the earl of Anjou,
being, in fact, caused by the artfulness of his daughter. By
the excitement arising therefrom, the king was excited to anger
and rancorous feelings, which by some was said to be the cause
of a chill of his constitution, and afterwards of his death. For
when the king had returned from hunting, at Saint Dennis, in
the wood of Lions, he ate the flesh of some murense, or lam-
preys, a fish which he was always very fond of, and which
always disagreed with him. But although the physician had
forbidden him to eat of this fish, the king did not obey his
wholesome advice, in conformity with the saying, "We al-
ways strive for what is prohibited, and desire what is denied." 81

This food, therefore, was a source of most noxious humours,
and a strong exciter of others of a kindred nature, and suddenly
caused a deadly chill in his aged body, creating a great dis-
order thereby. Nature struggling against this, caused an acute
fever, in its attempts to resist the attack resulting from this
most noxious substance; but the disease gaining the ascen-
dancy, this mighty king departed this life, after having reigned

81 "Nitimur in vetitum semper, cupimusque negata."



A.D. 1135. DEATH OF KING HEKRY. 225

five years and three months, on the first day of December;
relative to whom one of our writers says :

" King Henry is dead ! the glory once, now the grief of the
world. The Deities lament the death of their fellow divinity :
Mercury, his inferior in eloquence, Apollo, in strength of
mind, Jupiter, in command, and Mars, in might ; all bewail
him. Janus, his inferior in caution, Alcides, in prowess, Pal-
las, in arms, Minerva, in arts; all bewail him. England,
who, springing from her cradle, had shone exalted on high
beneath the sceptre of this divinity, now sinks in shade. She,
with her king, Normandy, with her duke, waxes faint ; the
one nurtured him as a child, the other lost him as a man."

This happened in the year from the arrival of the Britons
in England, two thousand two hundred and sixty-five ; from
the arrival of the Normans, sixty-nine ; from the beginning of
the world, five thousand three hundred and seventeen ; 8Z in
the year of grace, eleven hundred and thirty-five.

On the decease of the great king Henry, as is generally the
case after death, the judgment of the people was freely pro-
nounced upon him. Some asserted that he shone resplendent in
, three particulars ; supreme wisdom, victory, and riches. . In
wisdom, because he was considered most profound in counsel,
remarkable for foresight, and distinguished for eloquence. In
victory, because, besides other exploits which he had successfully
performed, according to the laws of warfare, he had overcome
the king of the Franks. In riches, because in that respect he
far outstripped his predecessors. Others again, animated by oppo-
site feelings, charged him with three vices ; excessive avarice,
inasmuch as, while he was wealthy, in order that he might render
all his relatives poor, greedily gaping for their riches, he laid
hold of everything, with the hooks of informers, by means of
taxes and exactions ; cruelty, inasmuch as he put out the eyes
of his kinsman, the earl of Moretuil, whom he had thrown
into prison, (a horrid crime, which was not known until
death had revealed the king's secrets) ; other instances were
cited besides, which we will omit ; and sensuality, because
after the manner of king Solomon, he was continually a slave
to his passion for the female sex.

82 This is clearly wrong, both according to our present reckoning, and
his own previous mode of calculation, which places the first year of the
Christian era in the year from the beginning of the world 4204.

Such matters as these did the common people freely discuss.
In the course of time, however, in consequence of the shocking
events which were kindled through the frantic perfidies of the
Normans, whatever Henry had done, either in a tyrannical
manner, or as befitted a king, seemed most excellent, in com-
parison with doings still worse. For after this, without delay,
Stephen, the younger brother of Theobald, earl of Blois, repaired
thither, a man of great activity and boldness ; and although he
had taken the oath of fealty, in the English kingdom, to the
empress and her son Henry, still, like a tempest, he rushed upon
the crown of the kingdom of England. William, archbishop of
Canterbury, who had been the first to take the oath, oh shame!
consecrated him king ; in consequence whereof, God pronounced
the judgment against him which he had pronounced against
the high priest, the smiter of Jeremiah, 8 ** namely, that he
should not live beyond that year. In like manner, Koger,
bishop of Salisbury, who had been the second to take the
before-mentioned oath, and had dictated it to the rest, gave
him the crown and the support of his assistance ; in consequence
of which, by the just judgment of God, at a subsequent period,
being taken prisoner by him whom he had created king, and .
consigned to torture, he met with a miserable end.

But why make any further remark? All who had taken
the oath, both bishops as well as earls and chief men, gave
in their adherence to Stephen and did homage to him. This
was, indeed, a bad sign, that thus suddenly all England, with-
out any delay or resistance, as though in the twinkling of an
eye, became subject to him.

KING STEPHEN.

In the year of grace 1136, on Saint Stephen's day, king Ste-
phen was crowned, and held his court at London. At his
coronation, according to report, the " Pax Domini" \JPeace
of the Lord~\ was neither said at the mass, nor repeated before
the people when this sacrament was performed.

As yet the body of king Henry remained unburied in Nor-
mandy ; for he had died on the first day of December. His
body was brought to Rouen, where his entrails, brains, and

82 * Alluding to the fate of Pashur, son of Immer, the priest, who

A.D. 1136. BURIAL OF KING HEXIiT. 227

eyes were buried ; but the remainder of his body being cut
asunder with knives in every part, and then sprinkled with a
quantity of salt, was wrapped up and sewed in bull's hides, to
avoid the offensiveness of the smell, which being strong and con-
tinued, was overpowering to those who stood near it. In con-
sequence of this, even the person who, in consideration of a large
sum, had opened the head with a hatchet for the purpose of ex-
tracting the brain, which was in a most corrupt state, although
he had wrapped up his own head in napkins, still met with
Ms death therefrom, and had poor reason for rejoicing at his
bargain. He was the last of the many slain by king Henry.

His attendants then conveyed the royal corpse to Caen,
where, while it was lying in the church in which his father
had been buried, it was steeped in a quantity of salt and
wrapped up in numerous hides, still a black and disgusting
liquid matter coming through the hides oozed forth therefrom,
and being caught in vessels placed beneath the bier, was carried
away by the servants fainting with disgust.

See, therefore, reader, whoever thou art, how the body of a
most potent king, whose head had been decked with a crown,
gold, and the choicest gems, with splendour almost divine,
whose two hands had been radiant with sceptres, the rest of
whose person had glittered all over with tissue of gold, whose
mouth used to be supplied with food so exquisite and delicious,
before whom all were wont to arise, whom all had dreaded, all

congratulated, all admired See, I say, to what that body

was reduced ; how horribly it was put out of sight, how shock-
ingly thrust aside ! Behold the result of human affairs,
upon which the judgment ever depends, and learn to have a
contempt for all that thus terminates, all that is thus reduced
to, annihilation.

At last, the remains of the royal corpse were brought to
England, and were, in twelve days after, on his birth-day, 83
buried at the abbey of Beading, which the same king Henry
had founded and enriched with many possessions. Thither,
also, came king Stephen from his court, which, at the feast of
the Nativity, he had been holding in London, to meet the body
of his uncle ; and with him, William, archbishop of Canter-

83 "Natalis" here, is probably a misprint for "Natali." Roger of
Wendover says that he was buried on Uis birth-day.

bury, and many bishops and nobles, and there they buried
king Henry with the respect due to a man so great.

King Stephen proceeded thence to Oxford, where he repeated
and confirmed the concessions which he had promised to make
to God, the people, and the holy Church, on the day of his
coronation, which were these : In the first place, he promised
on oath that, on the death of bishops, he would never retain
the sees in his own hand, but immediately consent to the
election and invest them with bishops. Secondly, he promised
on oath, that he would retain in his hand the woods of no clerk
or layman, as king Henry had done, who had every year
impleaded them, if they either took venison in their own
woods, or rooted them up or thinned them to supply their
own necessities : which kind of unjust impleading was carried
to so annoying a length, that, if the supervisors set eye from
a distance upon the wood of any person whom they deemed
to be a moneyed man, they immediately obtained an injunc-
tion against waste thereon, whether it had suffered waste or
not, in order that, by some means or other, they might be
enabled to mulct him. In the third place, he promised on
oath, that Danegelt, that is to say, two shillings on every
hide of land, which his predecessors had been accustomed
to receive yearly, he would give up for ever. These are
the principal things which he promised on oath to God ;
there were others besides; but none of these promises did
he keep.

In the meantime, while, at the close of the festival of the
Nativity, king Stephen was staying at Oxford, he received
tidings which informed him to this effect: "David, king of
the Scots, on pretence that he was coming with peaceful in-
tent for the purpose of visiting you, has come to Carlisle and
Newcastle, and stealthily taken possession of them both ;" to
which king Stephen made answer ; " What he has taken by
stealth, I will recover by victory ; " and thereupon, without
delay, the king moved forward his army, which was so mighty,
so valiant, and so numerous, that none in England could be
remembered like it. However, king David met him in the
neighbourhood of Durham, and, making a treaty with him,
restored Newcastle, but retained Carlisle with the king's con-
sent. David, however, did not do homage to king Stephen ;
because he had previously, as the first of the laity, promised



A.D. 1137- STEPHEN CEOSSES INTO NOBMANDT. 229

on oath to the empress, the daughter of king Henry and his
own niece, to maintain her in possession of England after the
death of king Henry. However, the son of king David, Henry
by name, did homage to king Stephen ; on which, the latter
presented him with the horough which is called Huntingdon,
by way of gift.

After this, the king returned at Lent, and held his court at
London during the festival of Easter, amid such dazzling
splendour, that there was never one in England more brilliant
than it in its multitudes, magnificence, gold, silver, jewels,
garments, and luxuries of every description.

At the time of the Rogation Days, the king was seized with
a lethargy, and it was currently reported that he was dead. On
hearing of this, Hugh Bigod secretly effected an entrance into
Norwich castle, and would not restore it to any person except
to the king himself on his repairing thither, and then very
reluctantly. It was now that the frenzied conduct of the Nor-
mans, which has been previously mentioned, began to produce its
effects in perjury and treason. The king, therefore, took Bading-
ton, the owner of which was one Robert, a traitor, who had re-
belled against the king; after which, he laid siege to the city of
Exeter, which Baldwin de Redwers 85 held against him ; and
being long detained there, and constructing many engines of
war, consumed a large portion of his treasures in so doing. At
length, however, the castle was surrendered to him, and the
king, following the most pernicious advice, did not exercise
vengeance upon the traitors. But if he had exercised it
on this occasion, so many castles would not have afterwards
held out against him. The king proceeded thence to the Isle of
Wight, and took it from Baldwin de Redwers, previously
Mentioned, whom he banished from England.

The king, elated at these successes, went to hunt at
Bramton, which is one mile distant from Huntingdon, and
there he held pleas as to the forests of his nobles, that is to say,
with reference to their woods and hunting, and thereby broke
the vow and promise which he had made before God and the
people.

In the year of grace 1137, being the second year of the
reign of king Stephen, the king, at the season of Lent,
crossed over into Normandy. Alexander, bishop of Lincoln, and
85 Or Rivers.

many nobles besides, crossed over with him ; and there, the
king, who was well versed in martial enterprises, enjoyed
brilliant success in all his enterprises ; thwarted the strata-
gems of the enemy, reduced the fortresses of the foe, and
proved himself the most distinguished among the greatest of
men. He made a treaty with the king of the Franks, and his
son Eustace did homage to the king of the Franks, for Nor-
mandy, which is subject to the superior lordship of the Franks.
This became known to the earl of Anjou, who was his most in-
veterate enemy, inasmuch as he had married the empress of
Germany, the daughter of king Henry, who had received the
oaths of Stephen with reference to England, and in conse-
quence, the husband and wife demanded possession of England,
but, in the end, consented to a treaty with king Stephen.
For the earl saw that, at present, he could not possibly cope
with the king's strength, both by reason of his great military
renown, and the money, of which an abundance was still left
from the treasures of the deceased king.

In the same year, Louis the Fat, king of the Franks,
departed this life, and was succeeded by his son Louis.
These two years, in fact, were the most prosperous ones of
king Stephen's reign ; but the third, of which we shall now
make mention, was of a doubtful and varied character, Avhile the
two succeeding ones were replete with loss and calamity.

In the year of grace 1138, being the third year of the reign
of king Stephen, the king, immediately on his return to
England, flew to Bedford, on the vigil of the Nativity of our
Lord, and besieged it throughout the whole festival of the
Nativity ; and, indeed, it was the opinion of many that he
incurred the displeasure of God, because the festival of fes-
tivals he paid little or no attention to. In the same year,
Peter de Leves, the anti-pope, departed this life. Bedford
having surrendered to king Stephen, he immediately moved
his army onwards to Scotland.

For king David, having sworn fealty to the daughter of
king Henry, as though under the veil of respect for his oath,
by means of his troops, was perpetrating the most execrable
deeds. Pregnant women they ripped asunder, and tore the
offspring prematurely from the mother's womb, tossed children
on the points of their lances, beheaded the priests upon the altars,
and then placed the heads which they had cut off from the



A.D. 1138. BISHOP RALPH ADDRESSES THE ARMY. 231

crucifixes upon the bodies of the slain, and, by way of ex-
change, placed the heads of the slain upon the crucifixes. In
consequence of this, wherever the Scots came, the places were
filled with cruelty and horror, the shrieks of women, the out-
cries of aged men, the groans of the dying, and the despera-
tion of the youthful.

On this, king Stephen aroused himself, and burned and ra-
vaged the southern parts of king David's kingdom, while David
himself did not dare to confront him. After Easter, however,
the disgraceful fury of the traitors became greatly inflamed. For
one of the rebels, Talbot by name, held Hereford, in Wales,
against the king ; to which, however, the king laid siege, and
reduced it to submission. Earl Robert, 86 the illegitimate son of
king Henry, held against him a most strongly fortified castle,
the name of which was Bristowe, 87 and another called Slede. 83
William Lovel held the castle of Kari ; 89 Paganel held the
castle of Ludiow ; "William de Houn held the castle of
Dunster ; M Robert de Nichole 91 held the castle of Wareham ;
Eustace Fitz-John, a one-eyed vile traitor, held the castle
of Malton; William Fitz- Allan held the castle of Salopes-
bury, 92 which last the king took by force of arms, and hanged
some of those who were taken prisoners ; on hearing of which,
Walkelm, who held Dover castle, immediately surrendered it
to the queen who was then besieging it.

While king Stephen was thus engaged in the southern parts
of England, David, king of the Scots, led an innumerable
army into England. By the advice and exhortation of Tur-
stin, archbishop of York, the nobles of the north of England
went out to meet him, with William, the illustrious earl of
Albennarle, and planted the standard 93 or royal banner at Al-
wrton, 94 on Cutune moor. As, in consequence of illness, the
archbishop of York could not be present at the battle, he sent
in his place Ralph, bishop of the Orkneys, 96 who, standing
in the midst of the army, on an elevated spot, addressed
them to the following effect :

232 ANXALS OF BOGEE DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1138.

"Most illustrious nobles of England, Kormans by birth,
(for when about to enter on the combat, it befits you to hold
in remembrance your names and your birth), consider who
you are, and against whom, and where it is, you are waging war;
for then no one shall with impunity resist your prowess. Bold
France, taught by experience, has quailed beneath your valour,
fierce England, led captive, has submitted to you ; rich Apulia,
on having you for her masters, has flourished once again ;
Jerusalem so famed, and illustrious Antioch, have bowed
themselves before you ; and now Scotland, which of right is
subject to you, attempts to show resistance, displaying a teme-
rity not warranted by her arms, more fitted indeed for rioting
than for battle. These are people, in fact, who have no
knowledge of military matters, no skill in fighting, no mode-
ration in ruling. There is no room then left for fear, but
rather for shame, that those whom we have always sought
on their own soil and overcome, reversing the usual order
of things, have, like so many drunkards and madmen, come
flocking into our country. This, however, I, a bishop, and the
substitute for your archbishop, tell you, has been brought about
by Divine Providence ; in order that those who have in this
country violated the temples of God, stained the altars with
blood, slain his priests, spared neither children nor pregnant
women, may on the same spot receive the condign punishment
of their crimes ; and this most just resolve of the Divine will,
God will this day put in execution by means of your hands.
Arouse your spirits then, ye civilized warriors, and, firmly rely-
ing on the valour of your country, nay, rather on the presence of
God, arise against these most unrighteous foes. And let not their
rashness move you, because so many insignia of your valour cause
no alarm to them. They know not how to arm 96 themselves for
battle ; whereas you, during the time of peace, prepare your-
selves for war, in order that in battle you may not experience the
doubtful contingencies of warfare. Cover your heads then with
the helmet, your breasts with the coat of mail, your legs with
the greaves, and your bodies with the shield, that so the foeman
may not find where to strike at you, on seeing you thus sur-
rounded on every side with iron. Marching then against them
thus, unarmed and wavering, why should we hesitate ? On

98 This is probably said in allusion to the absence of defensive armour,
with the half-naked Scotch.






A.D. 1138. DEFEAT OF THE SCOTS. 233

account of their numbers perhaps ? But it is not so much the
numbers of the many as the valour of the few that gains the
battle. For a multitude unused to discipline is a hindrance to
itself, when successful, in completing the victory, when routed,
in taking to flight. Besides your foi-efathers, when but few in
number, have many a time conquered multitudes ; what then is
the natural consequence of the glories of your ancestry, your con-
stant exercises, your military discipline, but that though fewer
in number, you should overcome multitudes ? But now the ene-
my, advancing in disorder, warname to close what I have to say,
and rushing on with a straggling front, gives me great reason for
gladness. I therefore in the place of the archbishop of you who
are this day about to avenge the sins committed against the
house of the Lord, against the priests of the Lord, and against
your king under the Lord's protection, whoever of you shall
fall fighting, do absolve him from all punishment for sins, in
the name of the Father, whose creatures they have so shame-
fully and horribly slain, of the Son, whose altars they have
polluted, and of the Holy Ghost, whose inspired ones, in their
frenzy, they have slaughtered." To this all the troops of the
English answered "Amen, Amen;" and the mountains and
hills re-echoed with their cries.

At the same instant, the Scots raised the shout of their
country, and the cries of " Albany ! Aloany !" ascended to
the heavens ; but the shouts were soon drowned in the dread-
ful crash and the loud noise of the blows. When the ranks
of the men of Lothian, who had obtained from the king of
Scotland, though reluctantly on his part, the glory of striking
the first blow, hurling their darts and presenting their lances
of extraordinary length, bore down upon the ranks of the En-
glish knights encased in mail, striking as it were against a wall
of iron, they found them impenetrable. But the archers of the
English, mingling with the cavalry, poured their arrows like
a cloud upon them, and pierced those who were not protected
by armoiir. Meanwhile the whole of the Normans and the
English, stood in one dense phalanx around the standard,
perfectly immoveable. The chief commander of the men of
Lothian fell slain, pierced by an arrow, on which the whole of
his men took to flight. For the most high God was offended
with them, and all their valour was destroyed even as a spi-
der's web. On seeing this, the main body of the Scots, which



234 AXNALS OF fiOGEK DE HOVEDES. A.D. 1139-

was fighting with the greatest valour in another part of the
field, was alarmed and took to flight. Next, the king's troop,
which king David had formed of several clans, as soon as it
perceived this, began to drop off, at first ; man by man, and
afterwards in bodies, the king standing firm, and being at last
left almost alone. The king's friends seeing this, forced him
to mount his horse and take to flight ; but Henry, his valiant
son, not heeding what he saw being done by his men, but solely
intent on glory and valour, while the rest were taking to flight,
most bravely charged the enemy's line, and shook it by the
wondrous vigour of his onset. For his troop was the only one
mounted on horseback, and consisted of English and Normans,
who formed a part of his father's household. His horsemen,
however, were not able long to continue their attacks against
soldiers on foot, cased in mail, and standing immoveable in
close and dense ranks ; but, with their lances broken and their
horses wounded, were compelled to take to flight. Eumour says,
that many thousands 98 of the Scots were slain on that field, be-
sides those who, on being taken in the woods and standing corn,
were put to death. Accordingly, the English and Normans
happily gained the victory, and with a very small effusion of
blood.

In this battle the commanders were the above-named Ralph,
bishop of the Orkneys, the illustrious William, earl of Albe-
marle, of the blood royal, and famed for his military prowess,
"Walter Espec, a celebrated nobleman, William Piperel of Not-
tingham, and Gilbert de Lacy, whose brother was the only
knight there slain.

On hearing of the result of this engagement, king Stephen
and all who were with him gave hearty thanks to God. This
battle was fought in the month of August. At the Advent of
our Lord, Alberic, legate of the Roman church and bishop of
Ostia, held a council at London, on which occasion, with the
consent of king Stephen, Theobald, abbat of Bee, was made
archbishop of Canterbury.

In the year of grace 1139, being the fourth year of the
reign of king Stephen, after the Nativity, the said king took
the castle of Slede l by siege ; and afterwards proceeded to
Scotland, where he laid waste the country on all sides with
fire and sword, on which the king was obliged to make terms
99 Roger of Wendover says, eleven thousand. 1 Leeds.



A.D. 1139 CONDUCT OF STEPHEN TO THE BISHOP OF SALISBrKY. 235

with him. King Stephen thereupon returned to England,
taking with him Henry, the son of the king of the Scots
[as a hostage]. He then laid siege to Ludlow, where the
same Henry, being dragged from his horse by an iron hook,
was nearly taken prisoner, but the king himself valiantly res-
cued him from the enemy. After this, without accomplish-
ing his object, he returned to Oxford, where a thing took place
remarkable for its disgraceful character, and at variance with
all civilized usage. For the king, after having received them
in peace, violently arrested at his own court Roger, bishop
of Salisbury, and Alexander, 1 * bishop of Lincoln, who, BO far
from refusing to settle matters with justice, had most earnestly
entreated permission so to do.

Having thrown bishop Alexander into prison there, he took
the bishop of Salisbury with him to his castle, called Devizes,
a finer one than which there was not in all Europe. There
he tortured him with the pangs of hunger, and tied a halter
round the neck of his son, 2 who had been the king's chan-
cellor, as though he were about to be hanged ; and by such
methods extorted from him the surrender of the castle, far
from remembering the benefits which, at the beginning of
his reign, beyond all others, he had conferred upon him;
such, then, was the reward he bestowed on him for his de-
votedness. In a similar manner he gained possession of Sy-
resburn, 2 * which was very little inferior to Devizes in magni-
ficence. On obtaining the bishop's' treasures, by means of them
he gained Constance, sister of Louis, king of the Franks, in
marriage for his son Eustace. On retiring thence, the king
took bishop Alexander, whom he had left in confinement at
Oxford, with him to Newark, where that bishop had built
castle, near the river Trent, extremely well fortified and
most amply supplied. On coming there, the king imposed
on the bishop a fast not prescribed by the law, 8 and declared,
on his oath, that he should be deprived of all food whatever
until the castle was surrendered to him. In consequence
of this, with considerable difficulty, by means of prayers and
entreaties, the bishop prevailed on his own people to transfer

1# Some historians call him the nephew of the bishop of Salisbury,
but he was suspected to be his son.

bishop of Salisbury, by Maud of Ramsbury, his mistress.

236 A.NNALS OF EOGEE DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1139.

his castle from his own authority into the hands of strangers.
In a similar manner, another castle of his was surrendered,
called Slaford, 4 not inferior to the other either in appearance
or excellence of situation.

Not long after, when Henry, bishop of Winchester, the king's
brother, who was now legate of the Roman Church, was hold-
ing a council at Winchester, Theobald himself, the archbishop
of Canterbury, and all the bishops who were with him, threw
themselves at the king's feet, and begged with the most earnest
supplications that he would restore their possessions to the
above-mentioned bishops, and promised that they themselves
would cordially forgive the king for all he had done against
them. But the king, listening to the voice of persons evilly
inclined, slighted the supplications of so many venerable men
of such high station, and would not accede to their requests.
In consequence of this conduct, the house of king Stephen was
consigned to impending destruction.

For, immediately upon this, the daughter of king Henry,
who had been empress of the Romans, and to whom the king-
dom of England had been secured by oath, came to England ;
on which, king Stephen besieged her at Arundel, and, either
through listening to perfidious counsels, or else seeing that the
castle was impregnable, allowed her to go to Bristowe. 5

In the same year, Roger, bishop of Salisbury, pined away,
being wasted as much by grief as by old age, and ended his life.
Let all, then, who read of this, be astounded at so great and so
sudden a change of events. For, from his youth upwards, so
many blessings had fallen to the lot of the man above-named,
and, without interruption, had so wondrously accumulated
upon him, that all said that, in his case, Fortune was forgetful
of her fickle disposition. Nor did he suffer any adversity dur-
ing the whole of his life, until at last so vast an accumulation of
miseries, befalling him at the same moment, overwhelmed him.
Let no one then feel confidence as to the long continuance of
his happiness, let no one presume on the stability 6 of Fortune,
let no one imagine that his seat can long be firm upon her
revolving wheel !

In the year of grace 1 140, being the fifth year of the reign
of king Stephen, after the Nativity, the said king banished

A.D. 1110. DEATH OF TUESTIN. 237

Nigel, bishop of Ely, from his see, as he was the nephew
of the above-named bishop of Salisbury; in consequence of
which relationship 1 he had become an object of the king's
hatred. As to where the king was at the feast of the Nativity,
or where at Easter, it matters not to say. For now, courts
held in regal state, and the pomp of royalty, handed down from
the ancient line of kings, were utterly put an end to, the vast
amount of treasures had been entirely expended, there was no
such thing as peace in the kingdom, all quarters were threat-
ened with slaughter, conflagration, and rapine. Shrieks, grief,
and terror re-echoed in tones like thunder on every side, and in
every place there were the tumultuous alarms of depredation
and violence. In consequence of this, the following Elegiac
lines were composed :

" Who shall give me a spring, for what else but a spring of
tears do I need r that with tears I may bewail the wicked
deeds of my native land ? A darkness hath come upon it,
sent from the depths of hell, which in lowering clouds covers
the face of this realm ! Lo ! frenzy, shrieks, conflagrations,
theft, rapine, slaughter, and bad faith, in strict alliance come
rushing on ! At the present day men act the thief both to-
wards the wealth and the owners of the wealth, and, strange
kind of theft ! while sleeping in their very, castles they sur-
prise them. Perjury is good faith, lying a noble act; even
the betrayal of their lords is a deed worthy of men. The
band of robbers breaks open temples and tombs, and even oh
shocking deed ! lays hands upon the priests. The anointed
of the Lord, and women as well, they torture, and oh
shame ! that they may purchase their liberty, devise how
to rack them with torments ! Famine, therefore, comes on
ajace ; their flesh consumed, to skin and bone reduced, they
breathe forth their fleeting souls ! Who can give sepulture to
crowds so vast of the dying ? Behold the face of hell, and a
calamity its like !"

In the same year, king Stephen gave Northumbria to Henry,
the son of David, king of the Scots. In the same year died
Turstin, archbishop of York, on whose decease there imme-
diately arose a division in the church of York, as to the elec-
tion of an archbishop. For some of the canons made choice of

7 " Progeniem," in the text, hinting that he was son of the bishop of

Salisbury.



238 ANNALS OF KOGEH DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1141.

"William, treasurer of the church of York, who was accordingly
consecrated by Henry, bishop of Winchester, legate of the
Church of Rome. But the other canons chose as their arch-
bishop Henry Murdac, who prevailed, and retained the arch-
bishopric as long as he lived, while archbishop William re-
mained with Henry, bishop of Winchester, who had consecrated
him, until the decease of Henry Murdac.

In the year of grace 1141, being the sixth year of the reign
of king Stephen, that king, before the Nativity, laid siege to
the city of Lincoln, the castle of which, Ranulph, earl of
Chester, had treacherously seized ; and there the king took up
his quarters until the Purification of Saint Mary ; when earl
Ranulph brought with him Eobert, the son of king Henry, his
own son-in-law, and some other valiant nobles, in order to raise
the siege by the king ; and the most valiant earl, having
with difficulty crossed a marsh, which was almost impassable,
on the same day, drawing out his troops in battle array, offered
the king battle. He himself, with his own men, formed the
first line ; those whom king Stephen had deprived of their
inheritance, the second ; and the great earl Robert, with his
men, the third ; on the flank there was a multitude of Welch-
men, better provided with daring than with arms. After
this, the earl of Qhester, a consummate warrior, glittering with
conspicuous arms, thus addressed earl Robert and the other
nobles :

" With the greatest sincerity, to you, most invincible chief-
tain, and to you, nobles and fellow-soldiers, do I return many
thanks, who have magnanimously shewn your goodwill to-
wards me at the hazard of your lives. Since then, I am the
occasion of your peril, it is only fair that I should be the first
to expose myself to peril, and be the first to pierce the ranks
of this most faithless king, who, after making a treaty, has
broken the peace. Wherefore, trusting both in the king's
injustice and in my own valour, I will straightway cleave asun-
der the royal ranks, and with my sword make way through the
midst of the foe. It shall be the part of your prowess to fol-
low me while I, lead the way, and to imitate my example as I
strike. I already seem to myself, in my presaging mind, to be
passing through the royal ranks, trampling the nobles beneath
my feet, and piercing the king himself with my sword."

Thus he spoke ; on which earl Robert addressed the youth,



A.D. 1141> FARL ROBERT ADDRESSES HIS TROOPS. 239

and standing upon an elevated spot, delivered a speech to this
effect :

" It is not without reason that you demand the honor of the
first blow, both on the ground of your noble descent, and the
valour wherein you excel. But still, if you stand upon noble
descent, I am not surpassed by you, being the son of a most
noble king, and the grandson of a most mighty monarch : if
upon valour, here are many men of most consummate bravery,
before whom not a man living can be preferred for prowess.
But it is a far different reason that influences me. For, con-
trary to the oaths which he made to my sister, the king has
cruelly usurped the kingdom, and, causing confusion on every
side, has been the occasion of death to many thousands, 8 and
after his own example, has distributed lands among those who
have no right thereto, violently taking them away from those
who rightfully possessed them. By those who have been thus
wickedly disinherited, with the aid of God, the Supreme Judge,
who prepares vengeance, must he be first attacked. He who
judges His people in equity, will look down from His habita-
tion on high in the heavens, and will never desert us in this
our great necessity, who with justice seek what is just. There
is one thing, however, most valiant chieftains, and all you
fellow-soldiers, which I desire firmly to impress upon your
minds, namely, that by the marshes through which with diffi-
culty you have passed, there can be no way of escape by
flight. Here, therefore, we must either conquer or die ; in
flight, hope of escape there is none. This alone remains for
you, to make a way into the city with your swords. But if
my mind presages aught of truth, the fact that you have no
possible means of escape is the very thing which, this day,
with the help of God, will gain for us the victory. For he
nfust needs have recourse to prowess, who has not any possible
means of escape. On the other hand, the citizens of Lincoln,
who stand close to their city, with minds quailing beneath the
vigour of your onset, you, proving victorious, will see flying
for refuge to their homes. Besides, consider who it is against
whom you are waging war. Alan, duke of the Bretons, comes
forth in arms against us, nay, rather, against God ; an infamous
man and one polluted with all kinds of crimes ; who in mis-

chief knows not his equal, who has never wanted the desire to
do injury, and who would consider it his only and extreme re-
proach not to be incomparable to any one in cruelty. There
is also come out against us the earl of Hellent, crafty in his
deceitfulness ; a planner of treachery ; in whose heart iniquity
is rooted, and guile in his mouth ; slothful in deeds ; pre-
sumptuous in heart ; magnanimous in words ; pusillanimous
ia acting ; the last to attack, the first to run away ; tardy
in battle, swift in flight. There is also come out against us
earl Hugh, to whom it seems a trifle to have broken his oath
to the empress, but he must commit perjury a second time
in the most glaring manner, by affirming that king Henry
gave the kingdom to Stephen and deprived his own daughter
thereof. There is also come out the earl of Albemarle, a
man of singular constancy in crime, ready for daring evil,
and slow to relinquish it ; whom his wife, taking to flight,
has abandoned by reason of his intolerable filthiness. There
is also come out the earl, who has taken away his wife from the
last named earl, a most avowed adulterer ; of singular impurity ;
a devotee of Bacchus ; a stranger to Mars ; wreaking with
wine, and unacquainted with warfare. There is also come out,
Simon, earl of Hampton, 8 * whose deeds consist of words alone ;
whose only gifts are promises ; who when he has said a thing,
has done it; when he has promised, has given. There are
also come out, other nobles just like their king, accustomed to
robberies ; enriched with rapines ; fattened upon murders ; all,
in fact, defiled by perjury. You, therefore, most valiant
men, whom the great king Henry has advanced, and man
has humbled, whom he has raised, this man has depressed,
arouse your courage, and trusting in your valour, nay, rather,
in the justice of God, take the vengeance thus offered to you
by God upon these wicked persons, and confer imperishable
glory upon your posterity. If then it is now your determi-
nation to be the instruments of this judgment of God, vow
that you will press onward, abjure all thoughts of flight, and
with one consent raise your right hands towards heaven."
Hardly had he concluded, when all, raising their hands to-
wards heaven, with a thrilling shout abjured flight, and getting
their arms in readiness for the attack, moved onward against
the enemy in splendid array.

A.D. 1141. BALDWIN ADDRESSES THE KING'S ABMT. 241

King Stephen in the meantime, his mind fluctuating amid
mighty cares, had the mass performed with the greatest so-
lemnity. But when, according to the usual custom, he was
placing in the hands of bishop Alexander a wax taper, an
offering to God worthy of a king, it broke. This was an omen
of sorrow to the king. The pix 9 also fell down upon the altar
in which was the body of the Lord, the string breaking in
the presence of the bishop. This was an omen of the king's
ruin. After this, the valiant king went forth, and with the
greatest coolness disposed his troops in battle array ; he him-
self on foot ranged in the closest possible order the whole
body of his men in armour, dismounted from their horses.
The earls with their troops on horse-back 10 arranged to fight in
two bodies ; but these bodies of horsemen appeared to be very
small, as the earls had brought but few with them, though
pretended to be more in number. But the king's army was
very numerous, and marshalled under only one standard, that
of the king ; upon which, as king Stephen had not an agreable
voice, the speech to the army by way of exhortation was de-
legated to Baldwin, a man of great nobleness, and a most
valiant soldier, who, standing on an elevated spot, when, by a
modest silence he had called the attention of all to his words,
thus commenced, with the gaze of all intently fixed upon him ;

" All those who, when the lines of battle are drawn up, are
about to engage, ought to see beforehand to three things : first,
the righteousness of their cause ; next, the number of their
men ; lastly, the prowess of their troops. The righteousness
of their cause, lest danger to the soul should be incurred ; the
number of their men, lest they should be overwhelmed with
the number of the enemy ; the prowess of their troops, lest,
tmisting in a multitude, they should, by relying on the weak,
still be overthrown. On all these points we see ourselves suit-
ably prepared in the matter upon which we are engaged. For
the righteousness of our cause is this, that, observing what we
have sworn to our king before God, we stand facing those who
1 1 uve proved perjured towards him to the peril of death. As
to our numbers, in horsemen we are not inferior, in foot more

nists of Stephen, and the liberty has been taken here of adapting the pas-
sage to that sense.

numerous. But the prowess of so many earls, so many nobles
and knights always accustomed to warfare, who in words
can express ? Besides, the boundless valour of the king him-
self will stand for you in the stead of thousands. Since, then,
your liege lord is in the midst of you, the Lord's anointed,
to whom you have sworn allegiance, perform your vows be-
fore God ; inasmuch as you shall receive the greater reward from
God, the more faithfully and constantly you fight for your
king, the faithful against the unfaithful, the observers of the
law against the perjured. Then, be of good comfort and filled
with entire confidence. Consider against whom you fight. The
might of earl '.Robert is well known : according to his practice,
he threatens much, and does but little, having the mouth of
the lion and the heart of the hare eloquent in words, and al-
ways in the back-ground through his slothfulness. As for the
earl of Chester, he is a man of unreasonable boldness, ready for
plotting, inconstant in performing, impetuous in warfare, un-
provided against danger, contriving schemes too lofty for his
reach, bent upon impossibilities, and bringing with him few
good soldiers : collecting a straggling multitude of strangers,
there is no reason why he should be dreaded. For whatever
he begins like a man, he always leaves like a woman ; since
in all matters in which he has been concerned, he has met
with misfortune, either overcome in the encounter and running
away, or if, on extraordinary occasions, victorious, sustaining
greater loss than those overcome. The Welchmen whom he
has brought with him are only objects of our contempt, oppos-
ing their unarmed rashness to the front of battle, devoid of skill
and all knowledge of the art of war, like cattle running upon
the hunting-spears. The others, both nobles and common sol-
diers, are deserters and vagabonds, and I only wish they had
been brought here in greater numbers, for the more they are
in number, the worse will they prove in the trial of them.
You, therefore, earls and men of noble rank, ought to be
mindful of your valour and your dignity. This day elevate
your prowess, so inestimable, to the most exalted pitch, and, in
imitation of your ancestors, leave to your sons an everlasting
glory. The constant success of your arms should be to you
an incentive to fight ; the continuance of reverses will be to
them a motive for running away. And indeed, already, if
I am not deceived, they repent of coming hither, and are at

this moment thinking of flight, if the rugged nature of the
spot would allow of it. Since then, it is not possible for them
to fight or fly, what else have they done but, by the will of
God, offer both themselves and their baggage unto you ? Ac-
cordingly, you see their horses, their arms, and their bodies
subject to your determination. Lift up your hearts, there-
fore, and stretch forth your invincible right hands, ye war-
riors ! to receive with extreme joyousness that which God
himself has presented to you."

Already, before he had concluded his speech, the shouts of
the enemy were heard, the clanging of clarions, the neighing
of horses, the re-echoing of the ground. The troop of the
proscribed which formed the van, charged the king's line, in
which were earl Alan, the earl of Mellent, Hugh, earl of
East Anglia, earl Simon, and the earl of Warrenne, with
such fury, that instantly, in the twinkling of an eye, it was
routed, and became divided into three parts ; some of them
were slain, some taken prisoners, while some took to flight.
The division which was commanded by the earl of Albemarle
and William of Ypres charged the Welch, who were advancing
on the flank, and put them to flight. But the troops of the
earl of Chester attacked the body of the above-named earl,
and, like the first line, it was scattered in an instant. All
the king's knights took to flight, and with them William of
Ypres, 11 a native of Flanders, a man of the rank of an earl,
and of great prowess.

In consequence of this, king Stephen was left with his body
of foot in the midst of the enemy. Accordingly, they sur-
rounded the king's troops on every side, and assaulted them in
every quarter, just in the way that an attack is made upon a
fortified place. Then might you have seen a dreadful aspect
of battle, on every quarter around the king's troops fire flash-
ing from the meeting of swords and helmets, a dreadful
crash, a terrific clamour, at which the hills re-echoed, the
city walls resounded. "With horses spurred on, they charged
the king's troop, slew some, wounded others, and dragging
some away, made them prisoners. No rest, no breathing-
time was granted them, except in the quarter where stood
that most valiant king, as the foe dreaded the incomparable

force of his blows. The earl of Chester, on perceiving this,
envying the king his glory, rushed upon him with all the
weight of his armed men. 12 Then was seen the might of the
king, equal to a thunderbolt, slaying some with his immense
battle-axe, and striking down others. Then arose the shouts
afresh, all rushing against him, and he against all. At length,
through the number of the blows, the king's battle-axe was
broken asunder. Instantly, with his right hand, drawing his
sword, well worthy of a king, he marvellously waged the com-
bat, until the sword as well was broken asunder. On seeing
this, William de Kahamnes, a most powerful knight, rushed
upon the king, and seizing him by the helmet, cried with a
loud voice, " Hither, all of you, come hither ! I have taken
the king !" All flew to the spot, and the king was taken.
Baldwin was also captured, who had made the speech for the
purpose of exhorting them, pierced with many wounds, and
bruised with many blows, while earning undying fame by
his glorious resistance. Richard Fitz-Urse was also taken,
who in giving blows and receiving them was distinguished
by his prowess. After the king was made prisoner, his troop
still fought on; indeed, being surrounded, they could not
take to flight ; but at last were all either taken prisoners or
slain. According to the usages of war, the city was plundered,
and the king, in a piteous condition, was taken there.

The judgment of God being thus wrought upon the king, he
was led to the empress, and placed in captivity in the castle at
Bristowe. 13 The empress was recognized as mistress by all the
people of England, except the men of Kent, where the queen 14
and William of Yypres fought against her with all their
strength. She was first received by the bishop of Win-
chester, the Roman legate, and, shortly after, by the citizens
of London. However, she soon became elated to an in-
tolerable degree of pride, because her affairs, after their uncer-
tain state, had thus prospered in warfare ; conduct which alien-
ated from her the affections of almost all the people. Irritated
at this, with all the spitefulness of a woman, she ordered the
king, the Lord's anointed, to be placed in irons. A few days

after, in conjunction with her uncle, the king of the Scots,
and her brother Robert, having collected their troops, she laid
siege to the fortress of the bishop of Winchester ; on which,
the bishop sent for the queen and William of Ypres, and
nearly all the nobles of England. In consequence of this,
large armies were soon formed on either side. Daily combats
took place, not rank meeting rank, but in skirmishes on the ex-
terior of the lines. Their exploits, therefore, were not con-
cealed amid the haze of battle, but the prowess of each was
conspicuous, and proportionate renown attended his exploits ;
so much so, that to all men of prowess this period seemed
rich in the dazzling exploits of illustrious men.

At length the army of the Londoners came up, swelled to
vast numbers, and, fighting against the empress, compelled
her to take flight. Many were taken while flying, and, among
them, Robert, the brother of the empress, was captured, in
whose castle the king was kept prisoner, and through whose
capture alone the king could be ransomed : and, accordingly,
they were both set at liberty. Thus then, through the judgment
of God, the king was lamentably taken prisoner, and, through
the mercy of God, he was mercifully liberated, and received
with v great rejoicings by the nobles of England.

In the same year, Alberic de Vere was slain at London, in a
sedition of the citizens. In this year, also, died Geoffrey,
bishop of Durham, and was succeeded in that see by William,
dean of the church of Saint Barbara, at York, who was con-
secrated by Henry, bishop of Winchester, the legate of the
Church of Rome.

In the year of grace 1142, being the seventh year of the
reign of king Stephen, that king built a castle at Winchester. 15
Just then, an immense multitude of the enemy coming upon
him unawares, the king's soldiers, on meeting them, were
not able to withstand their attack; on which they forced
the king to take to flight. Many of his men, however, were
taken prisoners ; and, among them, William Martel, the king's
sewer, who, for his ransom, gave up the fine castle of Sherburne.

In the same year, the king besieged the empress at Oxford,
from after the feast of Saint Michael till the Advent of our
Lord; and, shortly before the festival of the Nativity, the

14 It would appear from Gervase's Chronicle, that this battle took place
at Wilton, and not at Winchester, in the year 1 143.

empress fled across the river Thame, which was frozen, clothed
in white garments. The reflection of the snow and the simi-
larity deceiving the eyes of the besiegers, she escaped to the
castle of Wallingford ; upon which, Oxford was at length sur-
rendered to the king.

In the year of grace 1143, being the eighth year of the
reign of king Stephen, that king was present at a council
held at London in the middle of Lent. For, at this period,
no respect was paid by those who plundered to either the
clergy or the Church of God, and, whether clerks or lay-
men, they were equally taken prisoners and held to ran-
som. Upon this, the bishop of Winchester, the Roman
legate, held a council at London, which at the time was
absolutely necessary for the safety of the clergy. At this
council it was decreed, that no one who should violently lay
hands upon a clerk could possibly receive absolution from any
one, not even from the pope himself, and appearing in his pre-
sence. In consequence of this, a slight gleam of serenity, with
great difficulty, shone forth at last upon the clergy.

In the same year, the king seized Geofirey de Mandeville, 16
at his court at Saint Alban's, more in retribution for the
wickedness of the earl, than according to the law of nations ;
more from necessity than from virtuous motives. For, if he
had not done so, through the perfidy of this earl, whom from a
baron he had created an earl, he would have been deprived of
his kingdom. Accordingly, in order that the king might give
him his liberty, he surrendered to him the tower of London
and the castles of Walden and Plessis. In consequence of this,
the above-named earl, being stripped of his possessions,
attacked the abbey of Saint Benedict at Ramsey, expelled
the monks, and introduced his plunderers, turning the church
of God into a den of thieves. He was a man of the greatest
prowess, but of the greatest perverseness towards God ; of ex-
treme activity in worldly matters, but extremely neglectful
towards God.

In this year, shortly before the festival of the Nativity, the
bishop of Winchester, and soon after, the archbishop of Can-
terbury, repaired to Rome, to treat for the legateship, pope
Innocent being dead, and having been succeeded by Celestinus.

In the year of grace 1144, being the ninth vear of the

A.D. 1144. MIEACLES WBOFGIIT AGAINST THE WICKED. 247

reign of king Stephen, that king laid siege to Lincoln, where,
while he was building a fort opposite the castle which the
earl of Chester held by force, nearly eighty of his workmen
were smothered by the enemy ; consequently, abandoning the
work, the king retreated in confusion.. In the same year, earl
Geoffrey de Mandeville greatly harassed the king, and shone
forth with great glory in all his exploits. But, in the month of
August, the Divine power showed a miracle worthy of its
justice : for two persons, who had committed the like offence
in expelling the monks, and turning the churches of God into
castles, it punished with a similar retribution.

For Robert Marmion, a skilful warrior, had perversely acted
thus towards the church of Coventry ; while, as already
mentioned, Geoffrey de Mandeville had been guilty of the
like wickedness towards the church of Ramsey. Robert
Marmion, while attacking the enemy, and in the very midst
of a large body of his own men, was slain, singly, before that
very monastery, and, having been excommunicated, has death
for his everlasting portion.

In a similar manner, Geoffrey, the new-made earl above-
named, while amid the dense ranks of his own men, was,
singly, pierced with an arrow by a foot- soldier of the lowest
rank. He himself at first laughed at the wound ; but, after a
few days, died in consequence of it, and while excommunicated.
Behold here the laudable vengeance of God, similarly attend-
ant upon similar crimes, and worthy to be disclosed to all
generations ! Also, while the church was held by him as a
castle, blood gushed forth from the walls of the church and
the adjoining cloisters, in manifestation of the Divine dis-
pleasure, and foreboding the extermination of the wicked.
This was seen by many persons; and, in fact, I myself 11
' beheld it with my own eyes.

Wherefore, because they wickedly said that God was asleep,
God was aroused ; which is evident from these signs and mani-
festations. For, in this same year, Arnulph also, the son of
earl Geoffrey, who, after his father's death, retained possession
of the church as a castle, was taken prisoner and banished the

17 This is the earliest mention made by the writer of himself in the
capacity of witness of what he relates. He must have been very young
at the time ; consequently it was easy to impose on his credulity. He
may, however, be possibly alluding to the extermination of the wicked.

kingdom by reason thereof, and the leader of his troops, falling
from his horse at his inn, 18 dashed out his brains and expired.

In addition to this, the commander of his infantry, Reimer
by name, whose habit it was to pull down churches or destroy
them by fire, was crossing the sea with his wife, when, ac-
cording to the statements of many, the ship became motionless.
The sailors, astonished at this prodigy, made enquiry into
the cause of the circumstance, by drawing lots, on which the
lot fell upon Reimer. He, however, contradicting, with all his
might, that this was the fact, the lots were drawn a second
and a third time, and fell upon him still. Upon this, he was
placed in a boat, with his wife and the money which he had
most wickedly acquired, and immediately thereupon the ship
ploughed the sea with the swiftest speed, just as before. The
boat, however, with these most wicked people, being whirled
round by a whirlpool suddenly formed, was sucked in and
came to destruction.

In the same year, pope Celestinus having departed this life,
Lucius was appointed in his stead.

In the year of grace 1 145, being the tenth year of the reign
of king Stephen, that king was at first occupied in business
relative to the departure of Hugh Bigot. But, in the spring,
earl Robert, and the whole body of the king's enemies, built
a castle at Ferendimer ; 19 on which, the king, displaying his
usual activity, collected his forces and hurried thither, taking
with him a numerous and warlike body of Londoners. After
having assailed the fortress for whole days together, while
earl Robert and his supporters were not far from the king's
army, waiting for additional troops, by a display of military
prowess attended with the most laborious efforts, he gained
possession of it, though not without great bloodshed. Then,
at length, the king's fortunes began to change for the better,
and to soar aloft.

In the same year pope Lucius died, and was succeeded by
pope Eugenius. In this year also, Alexander, bishop of Lincoln,
went again to Rome, and was honorably entertained by Euge-
nius, the new pope, a man worthy of that highest dignity.

A.D. 1147. STEPHEN CBOWNED AT LINCOLN. 249

His mind was always kindly disposed, his discretion always
to be relied on, his countenance always not only cheerful but
even joyous. The bishop, returning the second year after this
to Lincoln, with wonderful taste repaired the church there so
skilfully, that it appeared more beautiful than when it was
first built.

In the year of grace 1 146, being the eleventh year of the
reign of king Stephen, that king, having assembled a large
army, built an impregnable castle, situate opposite to Walling-
ford, where Eanulph, earl of Chester, who was now on friendly
terms with the king, was staying with a large number of his
followers. But, shortly after, as the earl was coming in a
peaceful manner to the king's court, the king seized him at
Northampton, while apprehending no such attack, and thrust
him into prison until he had restored to him the most famous
castle of Lincoln, which he had taken from him by stratagem,
and all the rest of the castles which had belonged to himself ;
upon which, the earl was released from prison and restored to
liberty.

In the same year, the noble city of Edessa, in Syria, which
is now called Roaise, was taken through treachery by the
Saracens, on the night of the Nativity of our Lord, while the
bishop and Raymond, earl of Saint Gilles, and innumerable
troops collected from the whole kingdom, and the people of
the city were engaged in their religious duties ; who, on the
capture of the city, were put to death by the pagans. In this
city the remains of Saint Thomas the Apostle, which were
formerly transferred from India, are said to rest.

In the year of grace 1147, being the twelfth year of the
reign of king Stephen, that king, at the festival of the Nativity
' >f our Lord, was crowned at the city of Lincoln, which no
king had dared to enter, in consequence of certain supersti-
tions 20 preventing them. After the king's departure thence, the
earl of Chester came to Lincoln with his troops, for the pur-
pose of assaulting it ; upon which occasion, the commander of
his troops, a man of invincible bravery, was slain at the en-
trance of the north gate, and, after losing many of his men,
the earl was forced to take to flight. On this, the citizens of
Lincoln, being victorious, were filled with extreme joy, and,

king so doing.

with great pomp, returned thanks, attended with praises, to the
Virgin of virgins, their protectress.

At Pentecost, Louis, king of the Franks, Theodoric, earl of
Flanders, and the earl of St. Gilles, with numberless troops
from the well-peopled kingdom of the Franks, besides many of
the English nation, having assumed the cross, set out for Je-
rusalem, for the purpose of expelling the pagaas, who had
taken the city of Roaise. Conrad also, the emperor of Ger-
many, led a still greater body of troops, and both armies passed
through the dominions of the emperor of Constantinople, who
afterwards betrayed them.

In the month of August, Alexander, bishop of Lincoln, set
out for Auxerre, to meet pope Eugenius, who was then at that
place, having previously been to Paris. He was received by
the pope in the most honorable manner ; but, in consequence
of the excessive heat of the weather, brought with him to
England the seeds of disease and death, and died in the follow-
ing year, having for his successor Ptobert de Chedney.

In the year of grace 1148, being the thirteenth year of the
reign of king Stephen, the armies of the emperor of Germany
and of the king of the Franks, which, graced by those most
noble chieftains, marched onward with the greatest pomp,
were annihilated, because God utterly despised them. For the
incontinence ascended to the sight of God, of which they were
guilty in acts of fornication and manifest adultery ; a thing
which greatly displeased the Almighty, and was aggravated by
the rapine and all kinds of crime of which they were afterwards
guilty. Accordingly, at first they fell, attacked by famine,
through the treachery of the emperor of Constantinople, and
afterwards by the edge of the enemy's sword. The king of
France and the emperor of Germany, upon this, with a very
small number of followers, fled ignominiously, first to Antioch,
and afterwards to Jerusalem. On arriving there, the king of
France, as though about to do something to compensate his loss
of glory, having obtained the aid of the knights of the Temple
at Jerusalem, and gathering forces on every side, laid siege to
Damascus ; but having effected nothing there, he returned to
France.

In the meantime, a naval force, headed by no influential
men, and relying upon no mighty chieftain, but only on Al-
mighty God, inasmuch as it had set out in a humble spirit,



A.D. 1148. HENRr IS MADE DTTKE OF NORMANDY. 251

earned the favour of God and manifested great prowess. For,
though but few in number, by arms they obtained possession
of a famous city of Spain, Lisbon 21 by name, and another,
called Almeida, together with the parts adjacent. How true
is it that God opposes the proud, but to the humble shows
grace ! For the army of the king of the Franks and of the
emperor was larger and better equipped than the former one,
which had gained possession of Jerusalem ; and yet they were
crushed by a very few, and routed and demolished like webs
of spiders ; whereas these other poor people, whom I have just
mentioned, no multitude could resist, but the greater the num-
bers that made head against them, the more helpless were they
rendered. The greatest part of them had come from England.

In the meantime, Geoffrey, earl of Anjou, husband of the
above-named empress, the daughter of king Henry, entered
Normandy with a great army and ravaged it, and took many
castles and fortified cities ; and the nobles of Normandy, keep-
ing in mind the oaths they had made to the said empress
and her heirs regarding Normandy, readily changed to their
ride. For Eustace, the son of king Stephen, who had been
the duke of Normandy, and had married Constance, sister of
Louis, king of France, was now dead, and the king of France
had given his sister Constance in marriage to Raymond, earl
of Saint Gilles ; and from this period the wars so greatly in-
creased against king Stephen in England, that he could give
no attention to the defence of Normandy.

At this time, Henry, son of the empress Matilda, being
now a youth sixteen years of age, and having been brought
up at the court of David, king of the Scots, his mother's uncle,
was dubbed a knight by the same king David, at the city of
Ctrlisle, having first made oath to him that if he should come
to be king of England, he would restore to him Newcastle and
the whole of Northumbria, and would allow him and his
heirs to hold for ever in peace, without challenge of their
right, the whole of the land which lies between the rivers
Tweed and Tyne. After this, the same Henry, by the advice
and assistance of David, king of the Scots, crossed over into
Normandy, and being received by the nobles, was by them
made duke of Normandy.

?1 Great part of Portugal was at this time in the hands of the Moors.



252 AHTTALS OF BOGEB. DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1153.

In the year of grace 1149, being the fourteenth year of the
reign of king Stephen, Henry, duke of Normandy came into
England with a great army, on which many castles were sur-
rendered to him, and a great number of towns ; he also coined
new money, which they called " the duke's money ;" and not
himself only, but all the influential men, both bishops as well as
earls and barons, coined their own money. But from the time
when the duke came over, he rendered null the coin of most of
them.

In the same year, Louis, king of the Franks, and Eleanor,
his wife, returned from Jerusalem to France.

In the year of grace 1150, being the fifteenth year of the
reign of king Stephen, the abbey of Holcoltram was founded,
also the abbey of Kinross, in Moray. In the same year, also,
the Praemonstratensian order came to Dryburgh, at the feast of
Saint Martin

In the year of grace 1151, being the sixteenth year of the
reign of king Stephen, pope Eugenius sent by his legate, John
Papirius, four palls to Ireland, whither a pall had never been
sent before, and appointed archbishops at four places, one at
Armagh, another at Cashel, a third at Dublin, 22 and a fourth at
Connaught. In the same year, Geoffrey, earl of Anjou, departed
this life, and his son Henry succeeded him in the earldom.

In the year of grace 1152, being the seventeenth year of
the reign of king Stephen, during this year as also two pre-
ceding ones, king Stephen and Henry, duke of Normandy,
frequently engaged in battle, and did not withdraw from the
combat, except with a great loss of substance and of men ; but
the duke of Normandy always gained the day. For his re-
sources increased more and more, and became more abundant
every day, while the king's power decreased more and more.
For the chief men of the kingdom, bearing in mind the oaths
they had taken to the empress and her heirs, nearly all gave
in their adhesion to the above-named empress and her son, the
duke of Normandy. In the same year, Henry, earl of Nor-
thumbria, son of David, king of the Scots, and Matilda, his
daughter, departed this life.

In the year of grace 1 153, being the eighteenth year of
the reign of king Stephen, peace was restored to England, a
treaty being made between king Stephen and Henry, duke of

A.D. 1154. DEATH OF KING STEPHEN. 253

Normandy, whom king Stephen adopted as his son, and ap-
pointed his heir and successor in the kingdom, through the
mediation of the venerable man Theobald, archbishop of Can-
terbury, and Henry, bishop of Winchester. The king also
appointed the duke justiciary of England under him, and all
the affairs of the kingdom were transacted through him ; and
from this time forward the king and the duke were of one
mind in the government of the realm, so much so that, from
this period, no disagreement ever arose between them.

In the same year died David, king of the Scots, on the ninth
day before the calends of July, on which, his grandson Malcolm,
the son of earl H<zory, a boy twelve years of age, succeeded him
in the kingdom. In the same year, pope Eugenius departed
this life, and was succeeded in the papacy by Anastasius. In
this year died Bernard, abbat of Clernlle ; William, bishop of
Durham, also died in this year, and was succeeded by Hugh
de Pudsey, 23 treasurer of the church of York, nephew of the
above-named king Stephen. He was consecrated at Rome, by
pope Anastasius, on the Lord's day preceding the Nativity of
our Lord. In the same year died Henry, archbishop of York,
on whose decease archbishop William, whom pope Eugenius
had suspended, set out for Rome, and finding grace with pope
Anastasius, the archbishopric of York was restored to him.

In the year of grace 1154, being the nineteenth and last
year of the reign of king Stephen, Eustace, the son of king
Stephen, departed 24 this life. In the same year, William,
archbishop of York, was honorably restored to his see ; but
shortly after, by the treachery of his clergy, after receiving the
Eucharist, during his ablutions, he was destroyed by means of
some liquid of a deadly nature ; on which he was honorably
interred by Hugh, bishop of Durham, in the church of Saint
Peter at York ; and on the presentation of king Stephen, Roger,
archdeacon of Canterbury, succeeded him in the archbishopric.

In the same year king Stephen laid siege to many castles, and
took them, and levelled many of them with the ground ; almost
the very last of which was the castle of Drax; shortly after

23 Or De Pusat, or Pusar.

24 There is clearly a mistake here ; as the death of Eustace is mentioned
above as having taken place before the year 1148, in which year his widow
Constance was given in marriage to the earl of Saint Gilles. 1152 is
probably the date of his death.



254 ANXALS OF BOGEB DE HOVEDEN. A. a. 1154.

which, king Stephen died, and was buried at the abbey of Fever-
sham. He was succeeded on the throne by Henry, duke of Nor-
mandy, son of the empress Matilda, who was crowned and conse-
crated king by Theobald, archbishop of Canterbury, at London,
on the Lord's day before the Nativity of our Lord.

In the same year, Theobald, archbishop of Canterbury, gave
to Thomas Becket, his clerk, the archdeaconry of Canterbury.
In this year also, Louis, king of the Franks, caused himself to
be divorced from his wife Eleanor, daughter of the duke of
Aquitaine, the archbishops, bishops, earls and barons, making
oath that she had ceased to deserve to be his wife. However,
Henry, king of England, took the before-named Eleanor to
wife, and had by her sons and daughters. The king of France,
however, by his wife Eleanor, had no issue of the male sex,
and only two daughters, one of whom he married to Henry,
earl of Champagne, and "the other to Theobald, earl of Blois,
brother of the said earl Henry. After this, Louis, king of
the Franks, took to wife the daughter of the king of Spain,
by whom he had two daughters only.

THE SECOND PART.

IN the year 1155, being the first year of the reign of king
Henry, son of the empress Matilda, the said king laid siege
to the castles of his enemies in England, and captured them ;
some of which he retained in his own hands, and some he
levelled with the ground. After this, he crossed over into Nor-
mandy, and did homage to Louis, king of the Franks, for
Normandy, Aquitaine, Anjou, Maine, and Touraine, with all
their appurtenances. In the same year, died pope Anastasius,
who was succeeded by Adrian.

In the year of grace 1156, being the second year of the
reign of Henry, son of the empress Matilda, the said king
returned from Normandy to England, and caused nearly all
the castles, which had been erected in England in the time
of king Stephen, to be demolished, and issued a new coinage,
which was the only one received and current throughout the
realm; he also established peace in the kingdom, and com-
manded the laws of king Henry, his grandfather, to be ob-
served inviolably throughout the whole of his kingdom, and in
many matters followed the advice of Theobald, archbishop of
Canterbury.

In this year, a convent of nuns was established a second
time at Eccles.

In the year of grace 1157, being the third year of the reign
of king Henry, son of the empress Matilda, the said king,

by the advice and entreaty of Theobald, archbishop of Canter-
bury, conferred the chancellorship upon Thomas, archdeacon of
Canterbury, and bestowed upon him many revenues, both ec-
clesiastical and of a secular nature, and received him so much
into his esteem and familiarity, that throughout the kingdom
there was no one his equal, save the king alone. In the same
year, Malcolm, king of the Scots, came to the king of England at
Chester, and did homage to him in the same way that his grand-
father had done homage to the former king Henry, saving al-
ways all his dignities.

In the year of grace 1158, being the fourth year of the
reign of king Henry, son of the empress Matilda, the said
king Henry caused himself to be crowned a second time at
Lincoln, without 25 the walls of the city, at Wikeford. In the
same year, by the king's command, the castle of Werk 26 was
rebuilt. The king, and Malcolm, king of the Scots, met at Car-
lisle, but separated mutually displeased ; in consequence of
which, the king of Scots was not created a knight for the
present.

In the year of grace 1159, being the fifth year of the reign
of king Henry, son of the empress Matilda, the said king
Henry caused himself, a third time, together with his wife
Eleanor, to be crowned at Worcester, at the festival of Easter: 27
and when they came to the offertory, they took off their crowns,
and offered them upon the altar ; vowing before God, that
they would never in all their lives wear them again. In the
same year died Waltheof, abbat of Melrose, on the fourth day
before the nones of August ; he was uncle to king Malcolm.

In the same year, pope Adrian departed this life, and was
succeeded by pope Alexander the Third, who was canonically
elected and consecrated. But Frederic, emperor of the Ro-
mans, being unwilling to acknowledge him, erected an idol for
himself, Octavianus, an antipope, and, an execrable conven-
tion and league being formed of those of his own blood,
against pope Alexander, he with his nation determined to pay
veneration to him, on which a schism arose in the church,
which lasted eighteen years.

In the same year, Henry, king of England, having levied

a large army, laid siege to Toulouse, and although he sat before
it for a long time, and wasted his treasure in various expenses,
still he was able to effect nothing there, and, without gaining
his object, took his departure. In this expedition died William,
earl of Boulogne, son of king Stephen, and Hamo, son of the
earl of Gloucester, with many others. On his return from
this expedition, Malcolm, king of Scotland, was knighted by
Henry, king of the English, at Tours.

In the year of grace 1 1 60, being the sixth year of the reign of
king Henry, son of the empress Matilda, Malcolm, king of the
Scots, returned to his country from the expedition against Tou-
louse. On his arrival at the city called Perth, earl Feretaeh and
five other earls being enraged against the king, because he had
marched against Toulouse, laid siege to the city of Perth, and
attempted to seize the person of the king, but were not able.
On three different occasions, king Malcolm with a great army
invaded Galloway, and at last conquered it. In the same
year, king Malcolm gave his sister Margaret in marriage to
Conan, duke of Bretagne.

In the year of grace 1161, being the seventh year of the
reign of king Henry, son of the empress Matilda, that king
and Louis, king of the Franks, disagreed respecting some
divisions of their territories, and the castles of Gisors and
Neafle, which at that time were in the hands of Louis, king
of the Franks, and which the said king Henry. claimed as pro-
perly belonging to his dukedom of Normandy. But shortly
after they came to terms on these conditions ; that the king
of France should give his two daughters, whom he had had by
his wife, the daughter of the king of Spain, (the name of one of
whom was Margaret, and of the other Alice,) in marriage to
the two sons of king Henry, namely, Henry and Richard,
avho were as yet but little children ; that he should de-
liver the before-named castles of Gisors and Neafle into the
hands of the Templars for safe custody, until such time as
his above-named daughters should be married to the said sons
of king Henry, and that it should be arranged with them, that
is to say, with Robert de Pirou and Tostes de Saint Omer, that
when Margaret, the daughter of the king of France, had been
married to Henry, the son of the king of England, they should
deliver up to king Henry both the castles.

These terms being agreed to on both sides, and confirmed by

oath, the king of the Franks delivered both of his daughters
to the king of England, and the above-named castles into
the custody of the Templars. Shortly after this period,
Henry, king of England, caused his son Henry to be married
to Margaret, the daughter of the king of France, although they
were as yet but little children, crying in the cradle ; Robert
de Pirou, Tostes de Saint Omer, and Richard de Hastings, the
Templars, who had custody of the said castles, being wit-
nesses and consenting thereto ; immediately upon which they
surrendered those castles to the king of England. In conse-
quence, the king of France was extremely indignant at them,
and banished these knights from the kingdom of France, upon
which the king of England received them and rewarded them
with many honors. In the same year, Theobald, archbishop of
Canterbury, legate of the Roman Church, departed this life.

In the year from the incarnation of our Lord 1162, being
the eighth year of the reign of king Henry, son of the em-
press Matilda, the said king conferred the see of Canterbury
on Thomas, his chancellor. In the same year, pope Alex-
ander came into France, having been expelled from his see
by Frederic, the emperor of the Romans. He was honorably en-
tertained by king Louis and by Henry, king of the English, \dho
looked upon him as pope of the Catholic Church. In the
same year, Malcolm, king of the Scots, gave his sister Ada in
marriage to the earl of Holland. 29

In the year of grace 1163, being the ninth year of the reign
of king Henry, son of the empress Matilda, the said king of
England returned from Normandy into England ; and king
Malcolm having recovered at Doncaster from a severe illness,
a solemn treaty of peace was made between him and the
king of England. In the same year, pope Alexander held a
general council at Tours, at which he excommunicated Oc-
tavianus the antipope.

In the same year, a great dissension arose between the king of
England and Thomas, archbishop of Canterbury, relative to the
ecclesiastical dignities, which the said king of the English was
attempting to disturb and lower in estimation, whereas the
archbishop endeavoured by every possible means to keep the
ecclesiastical power and dignities intact. For it was the king's
wish that if priests, deacons, subdeacons, and other rulers of the
29 This passage is probably in a corrupt state.



A.D. 1164. MISSION OF EENULPH, BISHOP OP LISIETTX. 259

church should be apprehended on the commission of theft, or
murder, or felony, or arson, or the like crimes, they should
be taken before secular judges, and punished like the laity.
Against this the archbishop of Canterbury urged, that if a
clerk in holy orders, or any other ruler of the Church, should
be charged upon any matter, he ought to be tried by eccle-
siastics and in the ecclesiastical court ; and if he should be
convicted, that then he ought to be deprived of his orders,
and that, when thus stripped of his office and his ecclesiastical
preferment, if he should offend again, he ought to be tried
at the pleasure of the king and of his deputies.

In the year of grace 1 164, being the tenth year of the reign
of king Henry, son of the empress Matilda, the said Henry
gave to Henry, duke of Saxony, his daughter Matilda in
marriage. In the same year, having called together a great
council, and all the archbishops and bishops of England being
assembled in his presence, he requested them, out of their love
for and obedience to him, and for the establishment of the king-
dom, to receive the laws of king Henry, his grandfather, and
faithfully to observe them : on which, Thomas, archbishop of
Canterbury, made answer for himself and the others, that they
would receive those laws which the king said were made by
his grandfather, and with good faith would observe the same ;
saving their orders and the honor of God and of the Holy
Church in all respects. But this reservation greatly displeased
the king, and he used every possible method to make the bishops
promise that they would, without any exception whatever, ob-
serve those laws ; to this, however, the archbishop of Canter-
bury would on no account agree.

A considerable time after this, Ernulph, bishop of Lisieux,
came over to England, and anxiously endeavoured, day and
flight, to make peace between the king and the archbishop,
but was unable to ensure complete success. Upon this, by
the advice of the bishop of Lisieux, the king separated Roger,
archbishop of York, Robert de Melun, bishop of Hereford,
Robert, bishop of Lincoln, and some other prelates of the
church, from the society and counsel of the archbishop of Can-
terbury, in order that through them he might more easily in-
duce the archbishop to yield to his own attempts. After
this, there came to England a certain man belonging to the
religious orders, named Philip de Elcemosyna, being sent as

a 2

legate " a latere," by Alexander the Supreme Pontiff, and all
the cardinals, for the purpose of making peace between the
king and the archbishop of Canterbury ; by whom the pope
and all the cardinals sent word to the archbishop of Canter-
bury, that he must make peace with the king of England his
master, and promise, without any exception, to obey his laws.
Assenting therefore to this and other advice on the part of
these great men, the archbishop of Canterbury came to the
king at Woodstock, and there made a promise to the king and
agreed that he would, in good faith, and without any bad intent,
observe his laws.

Shortly after this, the clergy and people of the kingdom
being convened at Clarendon, the archbishop repented that
he had made this concession to the king, and, wishing to recede
from his agreement, said that in making the concession he had
greatly sinned, but would sin no longer in so doing. In con-
sequence of this, the king's anger was greatly aroused against
him, and he threatened him and his people with exile 30 and
death; upon which, the bishops of Salisbury and Nor-
wich came to the archbishop, together with Robert, earl of
Leicester, Reginald, earl of Cornwall, and the two Templars,
Richard de Hastings and Tostes de Saint Omer, and in
tears threw themselves at the feet of the archbishop, and
begged that he would at least, for the sake of the king's
dignity, come to him, and in the presence of the people
declare that he would observe his laws. The archbishop
being consequently overcome by the entreaties of such great
men, came to the king, and in the presence of the clergy
and the people, said that he had acceded to those laws
which the king called those of his grandfather. He also
conceded that the bishops should receive those laws and
promise to observe them. Upon this, the king gave orders
to all the earls and barons of the realm, that they should
go out and call to remembrance the laws of king Henry
his grandfather, and reduce them to writing. "When this
had been done, the king commanded the archbishops and
bishops to annex their seals to the said writing ; but, while the
others were ready so to do, the archbishop of Canterbury swore
that he would never annex his seal to that writing or con-
firm those laws.

30 " Exillium " is a preferable reading to " Exitium."

When the king saw that he could not by these means attain
his object, he ordered a written copy of these laws to be made,
and gave a duplicate of it to the archbishop of Canterbury,
which he, in spite of the prohibition of the whole of the clergy,
received from the king's hand, and turning to the clergy,
exclaimed, " Courage, brethren ! by means of this writing
we shall be enabled to discover the evil intentions of the king,
and against whom we ought to be on our guard ;" after which
he retired from the court, and was unable by any means to
recover the king's favour. And because he had acted unad-
visedly in this matter, 31 he suspended himself from the celebra-
tion of divine service from that hour, until such time as he
himself, or his messenger, should have spoken thereon with our
lord the pope.

After this, there came to England Eotrod, archbishop of
Rouen, on behalf of our lord the pope, for the purpose of
effecting a reconciliation between the king and the archbishop
of Canterbury ; to which, however, the king would on no ac-
count consent, unless our lord the pope should, by his bull,
confirm those laws. When this could be in nowise effected, the
king sent John of Oxford and Geoffrey Riddel, his clerks, to
pope Alexander, requesting him to give the legateship of the
whole of England to Roger, that archbishop of York, that so
through his means he might be able to confound the arch-
bishop of Canterbury. But our lord the pope would not, as
to this part of it, listen to the king's request. However, upon
the petition of the king's clerks, our lord the pope conceded
that the king himself should be legate for the whole of Eng-
land ; on such terms, however, that he could do nothing offen-
sive to the archbishop of Canterbury. The king, on seeing
ihis, in his indignation sent back to our lord the pope the
letters appointing him legate, which John of Oxford and
Geoffrey Riddel had brought.

In the same year, on the vigil of Saint Agatha, the virgin
and martyr, a great earthquake took place in the island of
Sicily ; so much so, that the city of Catania was utterly de-
stroyed, and the bishops and clergy, and all the inhabitants of
the city, perished ; thirty thousand fighting men, in fact, be-
sides women and children, which could not be numbered. On
the same day, after the destruction of the city of Catania, the

sea receded a distance of three thousand seven hundred and fifty
paces, 32 leaving vast quantities of fish of various kinds on the
sands; and when the inhabitants of the country adjacent to
the city that had heen overthrown flocked together, and were
intent upon taking the fish, the sea flowed back again and sur-
rounded them, and swept them away into the deep.

In the same year, William, the brother of Henry, king of
England, departed this life. In this year also died Octavianus,
the antipope, and was succeeded by the antipope Guido of
Crema. In the same year, the abbey of Cupar was founded
by king Malcolm. In this year also, Sumerled, the thane of
Arregaidele, rose in rebellion against his natural lord, king
Malcolm, and, landing in Renfrew with a vast army of Irish,
was there slain by a few of the people of the province. In
the same year died Herebert, bishop of Glasgow, and was
succeeded by Ingelran, the king's chancellor, who was conse-
crated by pope Alexander, at the city of Sens, although the
deputies of Roger, archbishop of York, vigorously opposed it.

In the year of grace 1165, being the eleventh year of the
reign of king Henry, son of the empress Matilda, the said
king assembled a great council at Northampton, where he
inflicted great annoyances upon Thomas, the archbishop of
Canterbury. For in the first place, the king made his own
horses take up their quarters at the archbishop's lodgings, on
which the prelate sent word to the king that he would not come
to court until his lodgings had been cleared of the king's
horses and men. On the day after the council, archbishop
Thomas came to the king's court, attended by his suf-
fragan bishops, and demanded his leave immediately to cross
the sea to go to pope Alexander, who at this time was stay-
ing in France ; this, however, he could not obtain ; but the
king said to him, " You shall first answer me, for the injustice
you have done to John, my marshall, in your court." For this
John had made complaint to the king that when he had
claimed in the archbishop's court a certain piece of land against
him, as held by hereditary right, and had for a long time im-
pleaded him in respect thereof, he was unable to obtain any
redress from him, and had appealed from the jurisdiction of
the archbishop's court upon oath, according to the custom of
the kingdom. To this the archbishop made answer :

A. P. 11G5. ILLNESS OF AECHBISHOP THOMAS. 263

" There has been no refusal of justice to John in my court ;
but he himself (whether by the advice of some one else, or
whether of his own free will, I know not,) brought into my
court a certain bundle, 34 and took the oath upon it, that in con-
sequence of denial of justice he withdrew from my court;
whereas it appeared to the justices of my court that it was
he who had done the injustice towards me, in thus withdrawing
from my court ; as it is one of the statutes of your kingdom
which says, ' If any person shall wish to appeal from the court
of another person, he must make oath upon the Holy Evan-



However, the king, paying no attention to Thomas, when
he had said these words, made oath that he would have both
justice and judgment at his hands. The barons of the king's
court thereupon sentenced him to be amerced by the king,
and although the archbishop endeavoured to appeal against this
judgment, still, by the entreaties and advice of the barons he
suffered himself to be amerced by the king, in the sum of
five hundred pounds, and found security for that sum.

Upon this, he retired from the court and went to his lodg-
ings, and, on account of the annoyance and vexation which he
felt in his mind, took to his bed and fell extremely ill. AVhen
this became known to the king, that he might annoy him
still more, he immediately sent to him, and summoned him
by trusty summoners, to appear before him on the following-
day, prepared to give him an account of the stewardship, which
he had held in the kingdom before his consecration. The
archbishop, however, being sensible that a heavy sentence of
banishment awaited him, if he should hasten to make his
appearance at the court, sought every excuse for delay ; both
tn the ground of the time given by the summons being ex-
tremely short, as also of his severe attack of illness. Upon
this, the king seeing that the archbishop would not appear
that day, sent to him Robert, earl of Leicester, and Reginald,
earl of Cornwall, to be witnesses of his illness. When they
came, they foundhim lying ill in bed, and at his entreaty granted
him a respite from coming to the court until the following
morning. On the same day it was told him, and word was

brought to him by those of the king's household, that if he ap-
peared at the king's court, he would either be thrown into
prison or put to death.

In consequence of this, the archbishop, after conferring with
his friends on these matters, by the advice of a certain pru-
dent person, next morning, before going to the court, cele-
brated with the greatest devotion the mass of Saint Stephen, the
Proto-martyr, the office 35 of which begins to this effect, "Ete-
nim sederunt principes, et adversum me loquebantur," &c., 36
and commended his cause to the supreme Judge, who is God.
Still, for celebrating this mass, he was afterwards severely ac-
cused by Gilbert, bishop of London, who spoke in the king's
behalf. For the bishop of London made it an accusation
against him, that he had ' celebrated this mass by means of
the magic art. and out of contempt of the king.

After having thus celebrated the mass, the archbishop placed
over his shoulders his stole, and then put on his black canoni-
cal cape, and forthwith set out for the king's court. Imme-
diately upon this, a great crowd of people collected together
from all quarters to see what would be the end of it. He
carried his cross in his right hand, while with the left
he held the reins of the horse on which he was seated, and
on coming to the king's palace dismounted, and, still hold-
ing the cross, entered the royal mansion ; after which, he
entered the outer chamber alone, still carrying his cross ; but
no one of his people followed him thither. On entering the
chamber, he found there a great number of the common people,
on which he took his seat among them. The king, however,
was in his private closet with the persons of his household.

On this, Gilbert, the bishop of London, came to the arch-
bishop on the king's behalf, and greatly censured him for coming
to the court thus armed with the cross, and even tried to wrest
it from his hands, but the archbishop grasped it too tightly
for him ; whereupon, Henry, the bishop of Winchester, said to
the bishop of London, " Brother, allow the archbishop to retain
his cross ; for he ought himself to be well able to carry it."
The bishop of London, being greatly enraged at this remark,
turned to the bishop of Winchester, and replied, " Brother,

you have spoken to ill purpose, and evil will ensue to you
therefrom, inasmuch as you have spoken against the king's
interests."

Next came to him Roger, the archbishop of York. " Oh,
how oft did he wish to' approach him with bland requests,
and soft entreaties to use I" 37 But the old embers of hatred
forbade him so to do, and would not allow him to utter a word
in a peaceful way. On the contrary, he uttered the most severe
reproaches against him for thus coming to court armed with
the cross ; saying that the king had a sword which was still
sharper, and therefore, if he followed his advice, he would
put aside his cross. On this, one of the bystanders made this re-
mark : " Believe me, if you believe him, you will be deceived.
The fowler plays sweetly on his pipe while decoying the birds.
Beneath sweet honey noxious poisons lie concealed." ^ How-
ever, the archbishop of Canterbury refused to put aside his
cross, but said : "If the king's sword carnally slays the body,
my sword pierces spiritually, and sends the soul to hell." Now
while he was sitting there waiting, some persons secretly told
him that his death had been sworn by the king's followers ;
in consequence of which, from that hour he sought an oppor-
tunity for withdrawing from the court, and, that he might
more easily withdraw, appealed to the Supreme Pontiff, placing
the cause of the Church and of himself under the protection of
God and of our lord the pope ; and gave orders to all the bishops
inviolably to observe his appeal. 39 Upon this, all the bishops
advised him to comply with the king's wishes, and, surrender-
ing his see, throw himself upon his mercy ; but the archbishop
refused to trust them upon that point.

At this moment the king sent him word by his knights
t< i come to him without delay, and render to him a full account
of all the receipts of the revenues of the kingdom during the

time that he had been his chancellor. And, in particular, he
was questioned with reference to thirty thousand pounds of
silver ; on which the archbishop made answer : " My lord the
king knows that I have often rendered him an account with
reference to all the demands he is now making upon me,
before my election to the archbishopric of Canterbury. But,
upon my election to that see, the king's son, Henry, to whom
the kingdom was bound by its oath, and all the barons of the
exchequer, and Richard de Lucy, the justiciary of England,
released me before God and the Holy Church, from all receipts
and reckonings, and from all secular exactions on behalf of our
lord the king, and thus, free and acquitted, was I elected to the
administration of the duties of this office ; and for that reason
do I refuse to plead any further." The king, upon hearing this,
said to his barons : " Make haste and pronounce judgment
upon this person, who, being my liege-man, refuses to take his
trial in my court;" on which they went forth, and pro-
nounced that he deserved to be arrested and placed in con-
finement. On hearing this, the king sent to him Reginald,
earl of Cornwall, and Robert, earl of Leicester, to inform him
of the judgment that had been pronounced upon him ; who
accordingly said to him : " Listen to the judgment pronounced
upon you." To this, the bishop made answer : "In the name
of Almighty God, and under penalty of excommunication,
I forbid you this day to pronounce judgment upon me, inas-
much as I have appealed unto the presence of our lord the pope."
"While the above-named earls were carrying this answer to
the king, the archbishop went forth from the chamber, and going
through the midst of them, reached his palfrey, and mounting
it, left the palace, all the people shouting after him and
saying : "Where are you going, traitor? Stop, and hear
your sentence !"

When, however, he had arrived at the outer gates, he found
them shut, and was in great apprehension of being taken
by his enemies, but Almighty God delivered him. For, Peter
de Munctorio, 40 one of his servants, espied a number of keys
hanging on a nail 11 near the gate, and taking them down, opened
it, on which the archbishop sallied forth on horseback, the

king's porters standing by, and uttering not a word. The
archbishop made all haste to arrive at the house of some canons
regular, 42 where he was hospitably entertained, and com-
manded the tables to be set out and all the poor that were to
be found before the gates to be introduced to eat and drink
in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. This was accordingly
done ; and he, together with them and his people, becomingly
partook of the repast in the refectory of the canons, and, when
it was finished, made his bed in the church, between the nave
and the altar. In the meantime, he had secretly ordered pre-
parations to be made for his journey, as it was his intention to
depart by night. At twilight, therefore, when the king and the
rest were supping in the town, taking with him two friars of
the Cistercian order, the name of one of whom was Robert de
Caune, and of the other Scaiman, and a single servant, who
was called Roger de Broc, he went out of the town through
the gate, which was left entirely without guards, and at day-
break arrived at Lincoln, and was entertained at the house of
James. Here the archbishop changed his dress, and, changing
his name, ordered himself to be called by that of Dereman ;
and then, being recognized by few persons, taking remote ways
and bye-paths, he hastened towards the sea-shore, he and his
attendants riding on at night, and concealing themselves
in the day among his friends and acquaintances. At last
they arrived at the sea-shore, and reaching the port of Sand-
wich, secretly embarked on board of a ship, and then, secretly
setting sail, in the morning landed in Flanders, whence he
immediately made his way to France.

Before, however, he had arrived at the court of Louis, king
of the Franks, Gilbert Folliot, bishop of London, and William,
earl of Arundel, had arrived on behalf of the king of England,
to prevent the king of France from receiving the archbishop of
Canterbury in his kingdom, and to request him to beg our
lord the pope, out of his love for him, not to receive the arch-
bishop of Canterbury into his favour. But the more pains the
above-named envoys of the king of England took to have the
archbishop of Canterbury expelled from the kingdom of France,
the more did the king of France favour him and his cause.

In addition to this, the king of France sent brother Francis,
his almoner, to pope Alexander, who was at this time staying
4i The abbev of Saint Andrew.



268 AJTNALS OF ROGEB DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1165.

in France, begging him, as he esteemed the honor of the Ro-
man Church and the aid of the kingdom of France, in all
things to maintain Thomas, the archbishop of Canterbury, and
his cause against the tyrant of England ; and, accordingly,
from this moment our lord the pope received the archbishop of
Canterbury into great favour.

In the meantime, Henry, king of England, sent to our
lord the pope, Roger, archbishop of York, Henry, bishop of
"Winchester, Gilbert, bishop of London, Hilary, bishop of
Chichester, and Bartholomew, bishop of Exeter, together
with Guido Rufus, Richard de Ivechester, and John of
Oxford, clerks, and "William, earl of Arundel, Hugh de
Gondeville, Bernard de Saint Yalery, and Henry Fitzgerald,
laymen. These persons found the pope at the city of Sens,
and gave utterance to many evil and false accusations against
the archbishop of Canterbury ; but our lord the pope did not
believe them, as he knew that they were bearing false witness
against him.

On seeing that they could not gain their object, they re-
quested of our lord the pope that two legates might be sent to
England to take cognizance of the dispute which existed be-
tween the king and the archbishop of Canterbury, and 'to de-
cide it to the honor of God, and of the Holy Church, and of the
realm. However, our lord the pope was not willing to send any
cardinal or any legate, as he was aware that the king of Eng-
land was powerful both in word and deed, and that legates
might easily be corrupted, as being more athirst for gold and
silver than for justice and equity. Upon this, the envoys of
the king of England, being unable to gain their object, with-
drew from the court of our lord the pope. On the fourth day
after, Thomas, the archbishop of Canterbury, came thither,
and, throwing himself at the feet of our lord the pope, pre-
sented to him the above-mentioned writing, in which were
written the laws of England, which the king called the laws
of his grandfather. The pope, having heard them read in
presence of all the cardinals, and of the clergy and a large con-
course of people, pronounced a perpetual condemnation upon
them, and excommunicated all persons who should observe
them, or in any way maintain them.

In this year two comets made their appearance before sun-
rise, in the month of August ; one in the west, the other in

the north. A comet is a star which does not appear at all
times, but in especial at the death of a king, or upon the ruin of a
nation. When it appears refulgent with a hairy crown, it fore-
tells a royal death ; but, if it has long locks of hair ** which, as it
scintillates, it spreads abroad, it betokens the ruin of a nation.

In the same year, pope Alexander returned to Rome, and
was honorably received by the people of that city. In this
year died Malcolm, king of the Scots, and was succeeded by
his brother William. In this year, also, Henry, king of the
English, crossed over from England into Normandy, having
issued a shocking and execrable edict against pope Alexander
and Thomas, archbishop of Canterbury ; the words of which
were to the following effect :

" If any person shall be found carrying letters or a man-
date of our lord the pope, or of the archbishop of Canter-
bury, containing an interdict of Christian offices in England,
let him be arrested and without delay let justice be done upon
him, as a traitor to the king and the realm. Moreover, let
no clerk, monk, or lay brother of any orders, be permitted
to cross the sea, or to return to England, unless he has a letter
from the justiciaries permitting him to cross over, or a letter
from the king allowing his return. And if any such person
shall be found, let him be arrested and detained. It is also
forbidden that any person shall bring any mandate whatsoever
of our lord the pope, or of the archbishop of Canterbury.
And, if any such person shall be found, let him be arrested
and detained. It is also universally forbidden that any per-
son shall appeal to our lord the pope, or to the archbishop
of Canterbury, and that, in future, any mandate of theirs
shall be received in England ; and it is ordered that no pleas
whatsoever shall be held at their mandate. And if any per-
son shall do anything against this prohibition, let hrm be
arrested and detained. And further, if any bishop, priest,
abbat, monk, clerk, or layman, shall observe any sentence
of interdict, without delay let him be banished the king-
dom, and all his kindred, but they are to take away
none of their chattels with them, but let their chattels and
possessions be seized into the king's hand. Also, let all
clerks, who have benefices in England, be admonished

throughout every county, within three months after sum-
mons, to return to their benefices, as they wish to retain
those benefices and to return to England. And, if they shall
not return within the period before-mentioned, then let their
chattels and possessions be seized into the king's hand. Also,
let the bishops of London and Norwich be summoned to appear
before the king's justiciaries, to make redress for having, con-
trary to the statutes of the realm, laid an interdict on the
lands of earl Hugh, and passed sentence 46 against him. Also,
let Saint Peter's pence be collected and kept."

The Address of the llessed Thomas, archbishop of Canterbury, to
Henry, king of England, at his Council held at Chinon.* 1
" With great longing have I longed to see your face, and to
converse with you ; much, indeed, on my own account, but
more especially on yours. On my own account, that, on
seeing your face, you might recall to mind the services which,
in my obedience to you, I have devotedly rendered to you to
the best of my conscience; as God may help me at the last judg-
ment, when all shall stand before His tribunal to receive
according to what they have done in the body, whether good
or whether evil : also, that I might move you to take com-
passion upon me, who am obliged to live on charity among
the people of a foreign land ; although, by the grace of God,
I still have suflicient provision and in abundance. It is
also my great consolation that the Apostle says, ' All that
will live godly in Christ shall suffer persecution,' 48 and the
words of the Prophet are, ' I have not seen the righte-
ous man forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.' 49 Again, for
your own sake, for these three reasons ; because you are my
lord, because you are my king, and because you are my son
in the Spirit. Because you are my lord, I owe and offer
to you my counsel, as is due from every bishop to his lord,
in accordance with the honor of God and of the Holy Church;
because you are my king, I am bound to respect and to ad-
monish you ; because you are my son, I am bound by the
duties of my office to chastise and to correct you. For a father
corrects his son, sometimes in kind words and sometimes in

dover, in his narrative, as a letter from the archbishop to king Henry.

harsh, that, by the one means or the other, he may recall him to
do what is right. You ought to understand that, by the grace
of God, you are a king for the following purposes : first,
because it is your duty to govern yourself, and to amend your
life with the practice of good manners, in order that by your
example others may be induced to reform their lives, according
to the saying of the wise man, that the world is formed after
the example of the king. 48 In the second place, for encouraging
some and punishing others, by virtue of the power which you
have received from the Church with the sacrament of anoint-
ing, and with the sword which, in virtue of your office, you
wield for the destruction of evil-doers to the Church. For
kings are anointed in three places ; on the head, on the
breast, and on the arms, thereby signifying glory, knowledge,
and strength. The kings who, in ancient times, did not
observe the judgments of God, but sinned against His com-
mandments, were deprived of both glory, knowledge, and
strength, both they and their descendants: as examples in
proof whereof, witness Saul, Nebuchadnezzar, Solomon, and
many others. But those who, after their offences, in contri-
tion of heart humbled themselves before the Lord, to them
was granted more abundantly and more effectually the grace
of God, together with all the blessings above-mentioned ; as for
instance, David, Hezekiah, and many others. Christ founded
the Church and gained its liberty with His own blood, by
enduring the scourges, the spitting, the nails, and the straits
of death, and thereby left us an example to follow in His foot-
steps ; wherefore the Apostle says, ' If we be dead with him,
we shall also live with him. If we suffer, we shall also reign
with him.' 49 The Church of God is composed of two orders
the clergy and the people. Among the clergy are the Apos-
tles and Apostolical men, the bishops and other rulers of
the Church, to whom has been entrusted the care and go-
vernment of that Church, and who have the management of
ecclesiastical concerns, that they may cause all things to tend to
the salvation of souls. For which reason it was said to Peter,
and in Peter to the other rulers of the Church, ' Thou art Peter,
and upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of
hell shall not prevail against it.' 50 In the number of the
people are kings, dukes, earls, and other potentates, who

272 ANNAJLS OF ROGEB DE HOVEDEW. A.D. 1165.

have the management of secular business, that they may cause
it entirely to tend to the peace and unity of the Church. And,
inasmuch as it is certain that kings receive their power from
the Church, and not it from them, but (with your leave I say
it) from Christ, you ought not to give your commands to
bishops to absolve or to excommunicate any person, to bring
the clergy before secular courts, to pronounce judgment rela-
tive to tithes and churches, to forbid bishops taking cog-
nizance of breaches of faith or vows in such manner as is here
set forth in writing among your customs, which you style the
laws of your grandfather. For the Lord says, 'Keep my
laws ; ' and, again, by the mouth of the prophet, ' Woe unto
them that decree unrighteous decrees, and that write grievous-
ness which they have prescribed ; to turn aside the needy from
judgment, and to take away the right from the poor of my
people.' 51 Therefore, let my lord, if so it pleases him, listen to
the counsels of his liege, the advice of his bishop, and the cor-
rection of his father. Let him, for the future, have no inter-
course or communication with schismatics. For it is well known
to almost all the world how duteously and how honorably you
received our lord the pope, how greatly you have cherished and
have honored the Church of Rome, how greatly our lord the pope
and the Church of Rome have loved and honored your person,
and, on whatever occasion, in conformity with the will of God
they possibly could, have listened to your requests. Do not
then attempt, my lord, if you wish for the salvation of your
soul, in any way to withdraw from that Church what is its own,
or in any degree to contravene justice in acting towards it ;
but rather allow it to enjoy the same freedom in your
kingdom which it is known to enjoy in others. Keep in remem-
brance also the profession which you made and placed in writing
upon the altar at Westminster, to preserve its liberties to the
Church of God, at the time when, by my predecessor, you
were consecrated and anointed king. Restore, also, the
church of Canterbury, in which you received your promotion
and consecration, to that state and dignity which it enjoyed
in the days of your predecessors and mine. Restore, also, the
possessions which belong to that church, the towns, the castles,
the estates, of which you have made distribution at your will, and
replace in full all the things which have been taken from either

me as well as my clerks and laymen. Likewise, allow me
freely and in peace to return to my see, and I am ready
to serve you loyally and duteously, as my most dear lord
and king, in so far as I can, saving always the honor of God
and of the Roman Church and my orders. But if you will
not do thus, then know, for a certainty, that you will feel
the severity of God's vengeance."

The Letter of the blessed Tliomas, archbishop of Canterbury, to
Alexander, the Supreme Pontiff.

" To your presence, most holy father, do I fly for refuge ;
inasmuch as you have redeemed the liberties of the Church,
amid so great hazards to yourself, understand that that is
the sole or the principal cause of the persecutions to which,
following your example, I have been subjected. For I la-
mented that the foundations of the Church are being gra-
dually shaken, and that her rights are being destroyed by the
avarice of princes, and I therefore thought it my duty to meet
the malady on its approach. The more I felt myself bound
in duty to my liege lord, to whom, after God, I owe everything,
tne more safely did I think I might oppose his wicked insti-
gators ; until they had gained full possession of the serenity of
his favour, and had clouded it against me ; from which time,
as is the way among princes, they threw out charges and accu-
sations, in order thereby to ensure my persecution ; on which,
I preferred to be driven away rather than willingly to suc-
cumb. To these evils, this was added, that I was summoned,
as though a layman, to appear before the king and to satisfy
him thereon. And still further, in the quarter to which I looked
for support in my resistance, I was deceived ; for I found my
brethren, the bishops, at the bidding of the courtiers, prepared to
f renounce judgment against me. Thus, almost crushed by the
multitude of my antagonists, I have taken breath in your pre-
sence, which does not overlook even those who are in extreme
need. Under your protection will I prove, that I ought not
to have been brought for trial before that tribunal, nor yet be-
fore those persons. For what else, my father, would this have
been than to rob you of your rights ? What else than to sub-
ject the spiritual power to the temporal ? When once made,
this precedent would be generally established ; and for that
reason, I considered it my duty the more firmly to oppose it,

because a more ready method of doing injury would be intro-
duced, if any weakness were manifested at the outset. But it
will be their remark, ' The things which are Cesar's should
be rendered unto Caesar ; ' 52 still, if in many things we must
obey the king, we must not obey him on those points, the
result of which would be, that he would not be a king. To
do thus would be to make him not Caesar, but a tyrant ; and
then they would have to resist him, not for me, but in their
own behalves. For if to him is reserved the highest possible
judgment, when he is all-powerful to pronounce judgment
upon body and life, will there be any last appeal among man-
kind when he giyes judgment according to his own mo-
tives ? If those who have attacked me have taken the side of
justice, for what reason do they censure me ? If, on the other
hand, I have made my appeal to him, to whom it is not law-
ful or excusable to disallow an appeal, the consequence is, that
they must either be accusing me unjustly, or must have dis-
trust in your justice. For doubly should I be confounded, if
before your Holiness I should be convicted. And do I merit
persecution on the part of those, in behalf of whom I have laid
myself open to such attacks, and should have gained my point,
had they only been so inclined ? But badly fares the head,
if it is forsaken by the limbs. If too the eyes were to assume u
tongue in opposition to the head, if they were to be gifted with
foresight, they would find that/they were contriving evil against
themselves ; so likewise have the king's followers used their
aid against me to ensure their own slavery. What can have
been the cause of hatred so great that, in order to destroy me,
they should destroy themselves ? The consequence is, that
while they neglect their spiritual for their temporal duties,
they fail in both. And is it the fact that, while I protested
aloud and appealed to your presence, they presumed by their
judgment to condemn their own father ? Why, if they have
made a compact to agree with the prince who is so offended at
me in relation to the universal Church, even to you, most
holy father, may their suspicion extend. But they will affirm
that they have held with the king by reason of their duty to
their liege ; even so, corporeally to him, but spiritually to me.
Whom then, in preference to themselves, ought they to have
held with ? Ought they not to have submitted in preference
to the loss of things corporeal rather than spiritual ? But to this
St. Matt. xxii. 21. St. Mark xii. 17.



A.D. 1105. THE ARCHBISHOP TO HIS SUFFBAGAN BISHOPS. 275

they may reply, that this was not a proper time for provoking
the prince. How astutely do they argue to ensure their own
slavery ! Why, they themselves encourage it, who give shelter
beneath their wings to his excesses ; for if they had not given
their sanction, he would have refrained from acting thus.
And on what occasion is constancy more required than during
a time of persecution ? Are not his friends proved by the test
of persecution ? If people always succumb, what are they to
look for ? Resistance is necessary at times. Look then with
condescension, most holy father, upon my exile and persecu-
tions, and remember that once in your time I occupied an
exalted position, and that for your sake I have been loaded
with injuries. Put forth your severity, and restrain those at
whose instigations this persecution has befallen me ; and let
not aught of these things be imputed to my lord the king, who
is rather the instrument, than the author of these machinations."

The Letter of the blessed Thomas, archbishop of Canterbury,
to his suffragan bishops.

" Thomas, by the grace of God, the humble servant of the
church of Canterbury, to his venerable brethren, the bishop of
London, and the other bishops of the whole province of Can-
terbury ; may they so enjoy temporal blessings, as not to lose
those of eternity. My most dearly-beloved brethren, wherefore
do ye not arise with me against my enemies ? Why do ye not
take part with me against those who work iniquity ? Is it that
ye are ignorant that the Lord scattereth abroad the bones of those
who please men ? They shall be confounded, inasmuch as the
Lord hath despised them. Your discreetness well knows that
when the errors of a man are not opposed, they are approved ;
and that when truth is not defended, it is smothered. He, too,
who does not hasten to the reproval of that which ought to be
corrected, appears, Saint Gregory giving his testimony thereto,
to encourage him who commits the wrong. Enough, and even
more than enough, have we put up with our -lord, the
king of England ; and yet, in return, the Church of God has
received no support from him. We hold that it is a thing dan-
gerous and not to be endured, to leave unpunished for the
future, as hitherto, the excessive outrages committed by him
and his officials against the Church of God and the ministers
of that Church ; and the more especially so, inasmuch as, most

276 AJWALS OF ROGER DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1165.

frequently by letters and messages, and other means, as was
our duty, we have endeavoured to recall him from the perverse-
ness of his course. But since we have been hardly heard by
him, much more listened to, after invoking the grace of the Holy
Spirit, we have publicly condemned, and have made null and
void that writing in which are contained, not those customs, but
rather those corruptions by which at the present time the
Church of England is disturbed and put to confusion, as also
the authority of the said writing. All who observe, or enforce, or
counsel, or aid, or defend the same, we do likewise excommuni-
cate; and all you bishops, by the authority of God and of our-
selves, we do absolve from the promises, by which, against the
rules of the Church, you bound yourselves to the observance
thereof. For who is there that can doubt that the priests of Christ
are appointed to be the fathers and masters of kings and princes,
and of all the faithful ? Is it not understood to be an act of
lamentable madness for the son to attempt to make his father,
or the disciple his master, obedient to him, and by unrighteous
means of compulsion to render him subject to his power ? One,
too, whom he believes to have power to bind and to loose
him not only on earth, but even in heaven as well ? There-
fore, in order that we may not fall into the commission of this
error, we have rendered of no effect, and have made null and
void the authority of that writing, as also the writing itself,
together with all the corruptions that are therein contained ;
and more especially the following : 'Appeal shall not in any
case be made to the Apostolic See, except with the king's per-
mission. It shall not be lawful for an archbishop or bishop to
depart from the kingdom, to attend the summons of our lord
the pope, without the king's permission. It shall not be law-
ful for a bishop to excommunicate any person who holds of
the king in capite, or to lay an interdict upon any one of his
officers, without the king's permission. It shall not be lawful
for a bishop to take cognizance of perjury or breach of faith.
The clergy are to be brought before secular tribunals. Lay-
men, whether the king or other persons, are to take cognizance
of causes as to churches and tithes, and other enactments to a
like effect. We do also denounce as excommunicated, and have
excommunicated by name, the man called John of Oxford, who
has fallen into a damnable heresy, by tendering an oath to schis-
matics, through whom a schism that had almost died out has re-



A.D. 1165. THE ABCHBISHOP TO HIS SUFFRAGAN BISHOPS. 277

vived in Germany, as also for communicating with that most
notorious schismatic, Reginald of Cologne ; and because, con-
trary to the mandate of our lord the pope and of myself, he has
taken unlawful possession of the deanery of the church of Salis-
bury ; a deed which, so detestable as it is, so contrary to right, so
pernicious in its example to the Church of God, we do make utterly
null and void, and do render it of no effect whatsoever; and it is
our command to the bishop of Salisbury, and the chapter of that
church, in virtue of their obedience, and at the peril of their
orders, on seeing this our letter, thenceforth no longer to hold
him as dean thereof. In like manner, we do denounce as excom-
municated, and have excommunicated, Richard de Ivechester,
because he has fallen into the same damnable heresy, by
holding communication with Reginald of Cologne, the schis-
matic, as also by inventing and contriving all kinds of mischief
with those schismatics and Germans, to the destruction of the
Church of God, and especially of the Church of Rome, ac-
cording to the terms agreed upon between our lord the king
and them. We have also excommunicated Richard de Lucy and
Jocelyn de Baliol, who have been the authors and fabricators
of these corruptions ; also Ranulph de Broc, who has taken
possession of the property of the church of Canterbury, which
by right is a provision for the poor, and withholds the same,
and has arrested our men as though they were laymen, and de-
tains them in his custody. We have also excommunicated Hugh
de Saint Clair and Thomas Fitz-Bernard, who, without either
connivance or consent on our part, have laid hands upon the
property and possessions of the said church of Canterbury.
All others beside who in future shall lay violent hands upon
the property and possessions of the church of Canterbury
gainst our will and consent, we have included in the same sen-
ence of excommunication ; according to the words of pope
Lucius ; ' All spoilers of the Church and withholders of her
possessions, putting them away from the threshold of the said
mother Church, we do excommunicate, sentence to damnation,
and pronounce to be guilty of sacrilege.' And not these only,
but those even who assent thereto, does he comprehend in the
same sentence. The Scripture, also, in one place, tells us that
he who agrees with the sinful, and defends another in his sin,
shall be accursed before God and man, and shall be visited
with the most severe afflictions ; and likewise, that if any one



278 ANNALS OF BOGEB DE HOVEDEW. A.D. 1166.

defends another in his sin, he shall be more severely corrected
than he who has committed the sin. As yet, indeed, we have
delayed pronouncing this sentence against the person of our lord
the king, in the hope that perchance, by the inspiration of the Di-
vine grace, he may recover his senses ; still, we shall very shortly
pronounce it, unless he shall make haste so to do. Therefore, we
do command your brotherhood, and by virtue of your obedience
enjoin you, that henceforth you hold the aforesaid men who
have been excommunicated by us as excommunicated, and
cause them to be denounced as such ; in obedience to the de-
cree of pope Honorius : ' Be it lawful for all bishops to de-
clare the names of those who have been excommunicated by
them both to the neighbouring bishops, as well as to the people
of their own diocese, and placing them in a public place be-
fore the doors of the churches, to warn all comers thereby, so
that due diligence may be given to both points, entrance into
the churches may be everywhere denied to those excommuni-
cated, and grounds for excommunication may be removed from
the rest.' 52 And you, brother, the bishop of London, we do
command, and, by virtue of our authority over you, enjoin the
same, that you will disclose and show this our letter to the
rest of your brethren and to all our brother bishops of our pro-
vince. Fare ye well in Christ, and pray continually for us."

After these things, Henry, king of England, returned from
Normandy to England, and marched with a great army into
Wales, where he lost many of his nobles, barons, and men.
He also did justice upon the sons of Rees, 53 and upon the sons
and daughters of his nobles, for he had the eyes of the male
children put out, and cut off the noses and ears of the females. 54

In the year 1166, being the twelfth year of the reign of
king Henry, son of the empress Matilda, the said king Henry

52 This passage seems in a hopelessly corrupt state ; it runs as follows :
" Eaque in celebri loco posita prae foribus Ecclesiae, cunctis venientibus
inculcare, quatenus in utraque diligentia excommunicationis, ubique Eccie-
siasticus aditus denegetur, et excommunicationis causa omnibus auferatur. "

53 King of the Welch.

64 Holinshed has the following quaint passage as a quotation from our
author, which, if correct, goes to prove that his MS. differed materially
from the printed copy. " He did justice upon the sons of Rice or Rees,
and also on the sons and daughters of other noblemen that were his com-
plices, very vigorously, causing the eyes of the young striplings to be
picked out of their heads, and their noses to be cut off or slit ; and the
ears of the young gentlewomen to be stuffed."

expelled from England, and from all the lands of his domi-
nions, all the men and women he could possibly find belbng-
ing to the kindred of the blessed Thomas, archbishop of Canter-
bury; even infants crying in the cradle, and still hanging at
the mother's breast, he sent into banishment, that, upon seeing
them, the grief of the above-named archbishop might be in-
creased. "What art thou doing, thou tyrant ? What madness
is it that hath overcome thee, that thou shouldst thus drive
away from thy kingdom those who have done thee no injury,
and in whose mouths no guile has been found ? There is no
reason why the issue of the banished, so long as they observe
the laws, should not live in the city !

"When the blessed Thomas beheld them, he was greatly
afflicted, and, sharing in their sorrows, became more than
a martyr. " No wonder was it, then, if his mind, becom-
ing disturbed, melted away, like water dropping from the
snow." 55 Still, all these sorrows did the man of God endure
with great long-suffering. He had hardly remained two years
at the abbey of Pontigny, with the abbat Gwarine, and the
monks who were there in the service of God, under whose
charge he had been placed by Alexander, the Supreme Pontiff,
when the king of England sent word to the above-named
abbat of Pontigny, that if he any longer harboured the arch-
bishop of Canterbury in his house, he would, in such case,
banish all the monks of his order from England. The conse-
quence of this was, that the blessed Thomas, of his own accord,
departed from that house, in order that so many houses of
the religious might not, on his account, come to ruin. He,
therefore, betook himself to Louis, king of the Franks ; by
whom he was hospitably received, and sent to the abbey of
S^int Columba, near the city of Sens.

The Letter of pope Alexander to Henry, king of England.

" Alexander the bishop, servant of the servants of God, to
his dearly beloved son Henry, the illustrious king of England,
health and the Apostolic benediction. Although your great
devotion towards us and your mother the Holy Church seems
in some measure to have waxed cool, still, at no season do
we relax our paternal feelings towards you and the kingdom
entrusted to your government. Inasmuch, then, as the stripes

280 A1TSTALS OP EOGER DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1166

of a friend are better than the kisses of an enemy, your high-
ness ought diligently to advert thereto, and, seriously giving
it your consideration, observe that as the clergy are distin-
guished in their lives and habits from the laity, so also are the
tribunals of the clergy bound to be entirely different from the
tribunals of the laity. Wherefore, if you confound the same
in an unseemly manner, render subject to your power that
which belongs to Jesus Christ, enact, at your own good-
will, new laws for the oppression of the churches and of the
poor of Christ, and introduce customs which you style those
of your grandfather, then, without doubt, at the last judg-
ment, which you will not be able to escape, you yourself will
be judged in a similar manner ; ' "With the same measure
with which you mete, it shall be measured to you again.' 58
But, lest our admonitions may appear in some measure tedious
or harsh to the ears of your highness, recollect the words
of the Scripture, that ' the son whom the father loveth he
correcteth,' 57 knowing this for certain, that the more ardently
we love your person with all brotherly love in the Lord, and
the more frequently and thoughtfully we recall to mind the
marks of your most sincere attachment to us and to the Church
of God, which you formerly so frequently and so bounte-
ously showed, the more readily do we make these intima-
tions to you, to whom, with all the yearnings of our heart,
we wish spiritual and eternal welfare. But if the future
judgment is in any way to deter you, or if a crown of glory,
as a reward in your eternal rest, has any delights for you,
then does it befit you to worship true justice, which is God ; to
con cede to every one his rights, and to leave to the ecclesiastics
all ecclesiastical matters, and especially those of a criminal
nature, which arise from breaches of faith or of oaths, and all
cases relative to the property and possessions of churches.
In fact, it would neither befit, nor, indeed, be expedient for
your serene highness to confound the offices of king and priest.
For, if the whole of the property of the Church, which by
means of oppression of this nature has been converted to
your use, were to be expended by you in the relief of the poor, or
in other works of piety, you would therein be paying a mark
of respect not more pleasing to God than if, after offering
one alms-dish on the altar, you were to cover up another, or,

THE POPE'S LETTER TO BISHOP GIXBEBT. 281

if you were to crucify Peter, that you might deliver Paul from
peril of death. For you ought to recollect, and have it as an
example on this occasion before your eyes, how king Saul,
who, after he had conquered Amalek, wished, against the
commandment of the Lord, to reserve the spoil, was re-
proved by the Lord when he made it his excuse that he
had reserved it for sacrifice ; and how, while he was still
alive, another man was appointed to the royal honors and
dignities. The sins of the people had raised him to be king,
but his own offences deprived him of the government of the
kingdom. How king IJzziah, 86 also, when he attempted to
sacrifice and to usurp the office of priest, was, as a worthy
punishment, smitten with leprosy, it would be for your well-
being to recall to mind. If, however, you shall ascribe your
successes to your might and prowess, and not to God, beyond
a doubt He who has set you over others, and made you a
great prince in the world, for the governance of the faithful,
and not for their oppression, will, with rebuke, require of you
the talents which have been entrusted to you ; and, as we
read of Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, who, for his father's
sins, was driven from his kingdom, so will God visit the sins
of the father upon the children. Do you, then, give no heed
to the evil suggestions of any .person, nor incline your ear to
those who are always whispering mischief, but diligently
attend to those things which concern your salvation. Where-
fore, make it your endeavour to govern to the honor of God
and the peace and tranquillity of the Church, for which alone
you have received the government of your kingdom, and study
to rule it to the best of the power that God has given you, to
the end that God may preserve for you your temporal kingdom,
jpd, after that, may give you one to endure world without end."

in behalf of the blessed Thomas.

" Alexander the bishop, servant of the servants of God, to

son in Christ, Henry, the illustrious king of England, upon
the increase and exaltation of the Church and of ourselves, we
deem it every way pleasing and acceptable, and, returning you
most abundant thanks for the same, with extreme praises, do
commend your prudent anxiety in the same unto the Lord.
And, inasmuch as we do love the said king and illustrious
prince with the greatest affection, as a most truly beloved
son, so both through you and through our venerable brethren,
the archbishop of Rouen and the bishop of Hereford, as also
through our most dearly beloved daughter in Christ, his
mother, the former illustrious empress of the Romans, have
we often and often, in divers ways, tried to induce and encourage
him to observe his duty to the Church. Wherefore, we do
rejoice and exult in the Lord at the dutifulness of the said king,
of which in your letter you have informed us. But, inas-
much as we wish him to continue in his duty to the Church of
God and to ourselves, as from the beginning he has been wont
to do, we do ask of your brotherhood, enjoin, and command that,
anxiously and diligently, you will often and often advise him,
both yourself and by others, and exhort him by all means, and
prevail upon him, after his usual manner, to use his best endea-
vours for the honor and exaltation of the said Church, and
manfully to support and maintain and defend her cause. Let
him, also, love and honor the churches and ecclesiastical per-
sons, and preserve their rights. Our venerable brother, also,
the archbishop of Canterbury, let him receive again into his
love and favor. And we, if he shall continue to pay to Saint
Peter and to ourselves that honor and respect which he has be-
gun to do, will love him with sincere affection, and will use our
endeavours in every way, as will be our duty, for the exalta-
tion of himself and the preservation of the kingdom entrusted
to him. And, indeed, we would prefer to outdo him in patience
and long-suffering, so long as we can possibly endure so to do,
rather than cause him vexation in any way. Given this Wed-
nesday, the eleventh day before the calends of September."

of sincere affection and the service of humble obedience.
Your mandate, dearest father in Christ, has been received by
us with due veneration, immediately on which, we presented
ourselves before your son, and our dearest lord, the illus-
trious king of the English, who is now at the head of his
army in the French territory ; and, in conjunction with our
venerable brother, the bishop of Hereford, we diligently and
carefully admonished him according to the tenor of your man-
date. We set before his eyes all the particulars of your letter,
and, beseeching him and expostulating with him as far as
was becoming towards his royal "majesty, we constantly and
incessantly exhorted him that he would satisfy us as to his
purposes, and that, if he had in any way departed from the
paths of reasonableness, he would not delay, at your admoni-
tion, through us, to return to the ways of truth and justice;
that, following the pious admonition of his father, he would
desist from all evil actions, would love God with purity
of heart, and would regard with his usual veneration his
holy mother, the Roman Church ; that he would neither im-
pede those who wished to visit her, nor prevent appeals
being made to her ; that benignly recalling and restoring our
brother, the lord archbishop of Canterbury, to his see, he
would remain firm and immoveable in his reverence for Saint
Peter and yourself, and that, giving his entire attention to works
of piety, he would not oppress either the churches or eccle-
siastical persons in his realm or in his territories, nor yet al-
low them to be oppressed by his means or those of another ;
but, on the contrary, diligently preserve them under his
royal protection, to the end that He, through whom kings
reign, might preserve for him his temporal kingdom while
on earth, and bestow on him an eternal one in heaven : that
otherwise, if he would not listen to those wholesome counsels,
your Holiness, who has hitherto patiently borne with him,
could no longer bear with him in your long-suffering. We
'further added, that we greatly feared for him, that if he
I did not correct his faults, he would before long incur the
wrath of Almighty God ; so much so, that his kingdom would
not be of long continuance, nor his family allowed to prosper ;
but that He who had exalted him when humble, would now,
when exalted, hurl him down with a heavy fall from the sum-
mit of the throne. On this, he received your admonition



284 ANNALS OF KOGER DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1166.

with much thankfulness and with much forbearance, and
with great meekness made answer to each part of it in order.
In the first place, he asserted that his feelings were in no way
estranged from you, and that he had never had in his mind
any other intentions, provided you showed a paternal solici-
tude towards him, than to love you as his father, to sup-
port and cherish the Holy Church of Rome as his mother,
and humbly to obey and follow your holy commands, saving
always the dignity of himself and of his kingdom. But that,
if for some time past he has not looked upon you with reve-
rence, he asserts that the following is the reason for the same :
that although he maintained your cause in your need, with all
his heart, with all his soul, and with all his strength, your
Holiness did not return him the like, according to his deserts,
in his time of need, when he had recourse to you through his
envoys ; but he complains, and feels ashamed to say, that in
almost every request he has made of you, he has met with a
repulse. Trusting, however, in a father's love, which, when it
shall think fit, will listen to his son, hoping for and expecting a
more cheerful countenance, he remains firm and constant, as we
have already said, in his attachment to Saint Peter and to your-
self. For this reason it is that he will not attempt to prevent
any one who may wish to visit your Holiness, and neither, as he
affirms, has he hitherto prevented them. As regards the question
of appeals, by the ancient institutions of his realm, he claims it
as his privilege and duty that no clerk shall go out of his king-
dom for any civil suit, unless he has first made trial whether by
the king's own authority and mandate he can obtain justice. But
if he shall be unable to obtain this, then, the king making no
opposition whatsoever thereto, any person whatsoever shall be at
liberty to appeal to your excellency, whenever he shall think fit.
And if upon this point your rights or dignities have been in any
way prejudiced, he promises that he will speedily correct the
same, with the help of God, in a synod of all the clergy of his
dominions. As regards the emperor, although the king knew
him to be a schismatic, still until this day he has never heard
that you had excommunicated him. But if on our information
he shall come to know that such is the case, if he has entered
into any unlawful compact with him or with any other per-
son, this he also promises he will have similarly corrected by
the judgment and counsel of the Church of his realm. The



A.D. 11CG. BISHOP GIIBEKT'S LETTEB TO THE POPE. 285

king also asserts that he has by no means expelled our father,
the lord archbishop of Canterbury, from his kingdom ; as he has
left it entirely of his own accord, so when he shall have a
mind so to do, he will be entirely at liberty with his entire
sanction to return to his church. Provided always, that while
he receives satisfaction on those points upon which he makes
complaint, he shall be willing that the royal privileges should
be faithfully observed to which he has been sworn. And, if
any church or ecclesiastical person shall make proof that they
have been wronged by him or his people, he will be prepared to
make full compensation, according to the judgment of the whole
Church. This is the answer which we have received from our
lord the king, although we could have wished that we had re-
ceived something more entirely according to your wishes.
This answer, however, we have determined upon notifying to
your highness, that from his reply your wisdom might be
enabled to form a judgment how to put an end to these
matters. But our lord, the king, seems in especial to justify his
cause, upon the fact that on all the points which have been men-
tioned, he will abide by the judgment and counsel of the Church
' in his dominions ; and he promises that he will in nowise
prevent the return of our father, the lord archbishop of Can-
terbury, as we have previously mentioned. Wherefore we
have thought proper to supplicate your excellency, keeping
this always before our eyes, ' A braised reed shalt thou not
break, and the smoking flax shalt thou not quench.' 66 Mo-
derate for a time, if so it please you, within the bounds of
discretion that zeal which is kindled by the flames of the
Divine Spirit to avenge each injury done to the Church of
God ; lest by pronouncing an interdict or the extreme sentence
, ofc excommunication, you may have to lament that number-
less churches are subverted, and so, which God forbid, irre-
vocably alienate from your allegiance both the king him-
self, and numberless people with him. For it is as good
for the limb to be joined to the head, even though wounded,
as to be cast away from the body when cut oft'. For wound-
ed limbs return to a state of healthfulness, whereas, when
once cut off, they have great difficulty in adhering to the
body. To cut off a limb, is to entail desperation ; whereas
the cautious treatment of the surgeon will very frequently
heal the wound. Wherefore, if so it please you, it were
66 St. Matt. xii. 20.



286 ANNALS OF KOGEK DE HOVEDENT. A.U. 11C6.

better that, at the present moment, you should use your en-
deavours in healing the wound, if any such there is, than
that, by cutting off the most noble portion of the Church of
God, you should bring to utter confusion that which, for this
long time past, has been in a state of confusion beyond what
can possibly be expressed. For, suppose that as yet your
wo'rds have not taken their full effect, or have been entirely
appreciated. Is then the Divine grace to be despaired of?
At an acceptable time, they may both have their full effect,
and be entirely appreciated. Is the hand of God so shortened,
that .it cannot save ? Or is his ear stopped, so that it cannot
hear ? Those words are swift in their course : God, when he
wills it, with a high hand works changes in all things, and
gives unhoped-for accomplishment to the prayers of his Saints.
Royal blood, then only knows how to be overcome when it
has been successful ; nor is it ashamed to yield when it has
gained the victory. By kindness is it to be mollified, by ad-
vice and long-suffering is it to be overcome. But what if
this long-suffering, when manifested, or needed for a time to be
manifested, causes some loss of temporal possessions ? Is there
nothing to be rescued from the wreck when the fate of multitudes
is threatened? Are not many things needed to be thrown into
the deep when the confusion of land, sea, and waves is threat-
ening destruction ? Foolishly, but still in charity, do we ad-
dress you in no fictitious language. If this should be the ter-
mination of the matter, that, losing everything, the lord arch-
bishop of Canterbury should submit to continual exile, and,
which God forbid, England should no longer obey your com-
mands, it would have been much better patiently to have
endured this for a time, than with such zeal to have insisted
upon acting with severity. For, suppose that your venge-
ance shall not be able to separate still more of us from our
obedience to you still, there will not be wanting some to bow
the knee to Baal, and without regard to religion and justice,
to receive the pall of Canterbury at the hands of their idol. Nor
will there be wanting persons to occupy our sees, and, seated
in our seats, to show him obedience with all feelings of duty.
Many are already prognosticating such things, hoping that
offences may arise, and that the straight may be made
crooked. Wherefore, father, we do not mourn or lament
our own misfortunes ; but unless you meet these evils, we see



A.D. 1166. THE ARCHBISHOP'S LETTER TO KING HENEY. 287

that a shocking subversion of the Church of God is threatened,
and that, becoming weary of our lives, we may curse the day
on which we were born to behold such a sight as this. Beloved
father in Christ, may Almighty God preserve you in safety for
long to come !"

The Letter of tJte blessed Thomas to King Henry.

" To his most revered lord, Henry, by the grace of God, the
illustrious king of the English, duke of Normandy and Aqui-
taine, and earl of Anjou, Thomas, by the same grace the hum-
ble servant of the church of Canterbury, health and best prayers
for his prosperity in all things. To speak concerning God stands
in need of a mind utterly free and unbiassed ; upon this sub-
ject it is that I address my lord, and, I trust, with peace to-
wards all men. I beseech you, my lord, that, with patience
of mind, you will endure some little advice, which, by the
grace of God, which is never ineffectual, will contribute to the
salvation of your soul and to my acquittal. Difficulties beset
me on every side ; even tribulation and difficulties have come
upon me, who am placed between two most grave and fearful
alternatives. When I say between two most fearful alterna-
tives, I mean a dangerous silence on the one hand, and admo-
nition of you on the other. If, on the one hand, I am silent, it
will be death to me, and I shall not escape the hands of the
Lord, who says, ' If thou dost not warn the wicked from his
wicked way, and he shall die in his iniquity, his blood He will
require at your hands. ' 57 If, on the other hand, I admonish you,
I fear, which God forbid, that I shall not escape the wrath of my
^lord. And I trust that it may not befall me, according to what
the wise man says, that when a person sends to intercede or
to admonish a person who is not pleased thereat, it is to be feared
left, becoming angered, his mind may be provoked to do what
is worse. "What, then, am I to do ? Am I to speak, or am I to
be silent ? In either alternative there is danger, no doubt.
But inasmuch as it is safer to fall under the indignation of men
than into the hands of the living God, trusting in the mercy
of the Most High, in whose hands are the hearts of kings,
and who will induce them as He shall think fit, (and I trust
that He will, to take the better part), I will speak to my lord,
inasmuch as I have once begun so to do. For often are good
w Ezekiel iii. 18.



288 ANNALS OF BOGEB DE HOVEDEff. A..D.11C6.

things provided for those who are unwilling, and especially
when the safety more than the will is consulted. In your
land is kept in captivity the daughter of Sion, the spouse of a
great king, oppressed by many, insulted by those who long
have hated her, and by whom she ought rather to be honored
than afflicted, and in especial by you. Keeping, therefore, in
your recollection each of those blessings which God has be-
stowed upon you in the beginning of your reign, in the middle
thereof, and almost unto the present moment, do you release
her, and allow her to reign jointly with her husband, to the
end that God may bless you, and that your kingdom may forth-
with begin to recover its strength, and this reproach be taken
away from your generation, and that unbroken peace may
reign in your days. Believe me, most serene prince, my much-
loved lord, the Almighty is slow in retribution, long-suffer-
ing in His patience, but most severe in His vengeance. Hear
me, and do that which is right. But, if otherwise, it is greatly
to be feared that (and I trust that so it may not be) He will
gird His sword upon His thigh, and will come in His might and
with a strong hand, armed with many woes, to set free His
spouse, and that not without heavy oppressions and servitude,
attended by tribulation. But if you listen to me, then the
Lord will of necessity be sensible forthwith of your duteous-
ness, as acting the part of a valiant soldier on His side, and
in such case He will bless you, and will add glory unto
your glory, even unto the issue of your sons and of your
daughters, down to distant times. But if otherwise, I fear,
and may God avert it from you, that the sword will not depart
from your house, until the Most High shall have come and ai i
avenged the injuries done to Him and His ; just as it did not
depart from the house of Solomon, although God had made
choice of him, and had conferred upon him such great wisdom, : "
and such an enjoyment of peacefukaess, that it was said by all,
' This is the son of wisdom and of peace ;' yet, inasmuch as
he departed from the path of the Lord, and proceeded from
wickedness to wickedness, God divided asunder his kingdom,
an'd gave it unto his servant ; and, in especial, because, after
the commission of his sin, he did not instantly seek to ap-
pease the Lord, as his father David had done, who imme-
diately after his offence humbled himself before the Lord, cor-
rected his fault, sought for mercy, and obtained pardon ; and

would that, with the grace of God, you would do the like.
These words I write unto you at present, the rest I have
placed in the mouth of him who bears these presents, a pious
man, one of great credit, and, as I believe, a faithful servant
of yours. In them, I pray that so it may please you to
place full belief ; still in preference, with your favour, I could
wish to enjoy the condescension of an interview with you.
Once and always to my lord, farewell !"

The Letter of the blessed Thomas to Robert, bishop of Hereford.

"Thomas, by the grace of God,- the humble servant of the
church of Canterbury, to his venerable brother Robert, by the
same grace, bishop of Hereford, health and blessings in all
things. If so it is that my letters have caused anxiety in
your brotherhood, would that it were the case that I had not
found you slothful in feeling, and not watchful in the due per-
formance of the duties of the office you have undertaken. I have
chosen to be cast out and to become accursed on behalf of you
all, a reproach before men and a scorn before the people, that I
might not behold the evils of the holy ones, and keep silence
upon the injuries done to my nation ; and anxiously did I wish
that perchance some one of you in his zeal for the law of God,
and his love of the liberties of the Church, would follow and
come after me, that so we might not give horns 58 to the
sinful. And behold ! you, whom I believed to be given unto
me by the Lord, that with me you might build, and weed, and
plant, are suggesting encouragement amid ruin, and solace in
despair ; inasmuch as you are preaching humility, nay, even
abject submission, and are announcing tidings of good, while,
on every side, confusion prevails, to the injury of God and of the
clergy : and this, at the moment when you ought to be
lengthening the constancy of my mind amid its vacillation,
and, with me, sustaining the attack, in order to defend
our inheritance of the cross and repel and crush the enemies
of the church, to be suggesting counsel to my ears, to be
breathing fresh life into my spirit, to the end that I might
entreat with the more firmness, that I might argue with
the greater cogency, and rebuke with the greater severity.
And, if they should refuse to hear me, then, undoubtedly,
ought you to have exclaimed, ' Why dost thou sleep ? Un-

sheathe the sword of Saint Peter, avenge the blood of the
servants of Christ that has been shed, the injuries of the
Church which are being daily committed against us and ours.'
Has it entirely escaped your memory with what injuries I
have been afflicted, with what insults persecuted, when, in
ray own person, against all authority and against all semblance
of right, Christ was brought to be judged before a lay tribunal ?
Still, I will not recail to your mind the injury done to my own
person but to the Church. Consider with thoughtfulness, and
deeply reflect upon it in your mind, what was done before my
departure, what was being done at my departure, what has
been done since, what, in fact, is being done every day in
your country, in relation to the Church of God and its servants.
With what conscience can you possibly conceal these things
from yourself ; you, of whom hopes were entertained that you
would be the redeemer of Israel, the liberator of the Church
from bondage? And, now, because you have so long held
your peace, I am always in affliction for you, my own begot-
ten son, lest he should come after you who shall take away
your birthright, and shall deprive you, which may God
forbid, of the blessing of the first-born. But, though even
thus far you have held your peace, resume your might (my
most dearly-beloved son) and cry aloud it is your duty so to
do lift up your voice against them, inspire them with fear,
awaken their contrition, banish their self-satisfaction, that so
the anger of God may not descend upon them, and the whole
people perish ; or even, which may God forbid, the rulers with
the people. For, even now, Divine vengeance is at the gates.
These things do I write unto you, not for your confusion,
but to put you on your guard ; to the end that, relying upon
the authority of God and of myself, for the future you may
be strengthened and may be willing more manfully and more
boldly to perform the duties of your office. This one thing
in especial I wish you to be assured of, with the mercy of
God, confusion to his Church shall not be extorted from me.
In addition to what I have said, I give you thanks for this,
that even now you have visited me, and have comforted me with
your solaces. Further there is one thing which I am not able
to endure without the greatest bitterness of soul verily. I
weep for my most beloved lord the king. For fear and trem-
bling have come upon me, and the shades have overwhelmed me,
since I have seen that tribulation and difficulties are threatening

my lord the king. And no wonder. For he has vexed the
Church of God, and has put her to confusion, and has made hard-
ships the lot of his clergy, giving them the wine of sorrow to
drink. Therefore, thus saith the Lord to him, ' Where now,
simple man, are the wise counsellors who used to say to
thee, ' Thou art the son of the wise, the son of ancient kings,
whose customs must be observed throughout England ; which
if a person shall not observe, he is not a friend to Caesar, but
an enemy to the crown, a criminal at the judgment- seat.' But,
assuredly, that person is rather the friend of the cross of
Christ ; for, ' Woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees,
and that write grievousness which they have prescribed, to
turn aside the needy from judgment, and take away the right
of the poor of my people,' 58 * that churches and widows may be
their prey, and that they may plunder the possessions of certain
of the clergy. What shall these persons do on the day of visi-
tation and of calamity that approacheth from afar ? To whose
aid will they fly for refuge, and lay aside their vainglori-
ousness, that they may not be bowed down under judgment,
and fall with the slain ? Where, now, are his wise men ?
Let them come forth, and let them disclose to him and say
what the Lord of Hosts has determined as to England. His
wise men are become fools, and his nobles have come to
nought ; they have deceived England, and into the midst of
the people of England its lord has introduced a feeling of
stupefaction. By their deeds they have made England to go
astray, even as a drunken man goes astray, vomiting and
staggering ; and for England help there will be none. Who
shall know the beginning or end 59 hereof? For they have
devoured Jacob, and have laid waste his dwelling-place, 60 and
have said, ' Let us take possession of the holy place of God,'
and have reviled the priests and their chief men, saying,
4 Whither will ye fly for refuge from our hands, or in whom
I do ye put your trust ? Why have ye fled, and proved dis
obedient to our commands ?' Oh, how empty are these thoughts !
how shameful these deeds in the sight of the Lord, who be-
holds how vain they are ! For He will laugh to scorn him who

thinks thus, when He shall see him acting thus ; because His
day is near at hand, even now He is at the gates, and will say,
' Behold the men who have not placed reliance in their God,
but have put their trust in the multitude of their riches, and
have waxed strong in their vanity !' But it is in vain that they
do thus ; the Lord will not leave His church, nor His clergy,
without a defender, without the heaviest vengeance. For it
has been founded upon a firm rock ; and that rock is Christ,
who has founded it with his own blood. Assuredly, if they
do not make amends herein, they will not escape with im-
punity, inasmuch as they have trodden under foot the Holy
of Holies, the house of God, and have afflicted His priests
with injuries and abusive words. These are those to whom
the Lord himself has said, ' I have said, ye are gods ; and
all of you are children of the Most High ;' 61 and also, in
another place, ' He that hateth you, hateth me, and he
that despiseth you despiseth me ; and he that toucheth you,
toucheth the apple of my eye.' 62 Let them then return to
their senses ; let them avert evil from themselves ; let
them with the greatest humility show repentance. But if,
they do not, then it is to be feared, and, oh may it be averted !
that the Lord will speedily come, and will bring upon them
and their land great tribulation and the most heavy vengeance
of His retribution. Behold! our Lord shall come and shall
not delay, and He shall save us ; inasmuch as He will never
forsake those who put their trust in Him. Eor the prophet
saith, ' Trust in the Lord, and do good, and thou shalt be
fed upon his riches ; ' 62 * and, again, ' Wait on the Lord,
be of good courage, and he shall strengthen thine heart ;' 63
and, ' put your trust in the Lord, and He shall soon deliver
thee from the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome
pestilence.' M And, that I may end all that I have said herein
with a becoming conclusion, inasmuch as the Lord has shown
what and how great things we ought to endure for His name
and in the defence of His Church, I hold it necessary for you
to pray, both you and the whole Church entrusted to your
charge, continually for us ; to the end that, what through our
own merits we are unable to endure, by your intercession and
that of the holy men who are subject to you, we may be
enabled to endure, and that thereby we may deserve to obtain

everlasting grace. Farewell, and be comforted ; farewell, like-
wise, to the whole of the Church of England, and may she be
comforted in the Lord, that so we likewise may fare well."

In the same year Henry, king of England, after his return
from Wales, crossed over from England in to Normandy, whither
he was followed by William, king of the Scots. In the same
year died earl Cospatric, in Albany, and was succeeded by his
son Waltheof.

In the year of grace 1167, being the thirteenth year of the
reign of king Henry, son of the empress Matilda, the said
Matilda, formerly empress of the Romans, and mother of the
above-named king, departed this life, and was buried at
Rouen, at the abbey called Saint Mary de Pratis. In the
same year, Frederic, emperor of the Romans, went to Rome,
and by violence and with an armed band, thrust Guido of
Crema, the antipope and schismatic, into the Apostolic See.
On his departure, a deadly plague immediately broke out among
his people, and Reginald, the archbishop elect of Cologne, who
was the head of the whole schism, perished on the Alps ; in
order that his bones might be separated from the flesh and
taken to Cologne, the whole of his body was boiled in water.

The Letter of the lles&ed Thomas, the a/rcJibisTiop, to Pope Alexander.

" To his most loving father and lord, Alexander, by the
grace of God, Supreme Pontiff, Thomas, the humble servant of
the church of Canterbury, due and dutiful obedience. I have
endured enough and more than enough, most loving father,
while waiting for the reformation of the king of England,
and yet have gathered no fruits whatever of my long suffer-
ing ; but, on the contrary, while unthinkingly submitting
thereto, I have incurred the loss and utter destruction of the
authority and liberties of the Church of God. I have often-
times by messengers, religious and fitting men, called upon
him, and have frequently invited him to make due satisfaction ;
as also by letters, the copies whereof I have sent unto you. I
have announced to him the Divine wrath and vengeance, if he
fails to come to his proper senses ; whereas he more and more
persists in his evil courses, treading under foot and depress-
ing the Church of God ; both persecuting myself personally
and those who are in banishment with me, so far as even to at-
sempt to deprive me, by threats and menaces, of the kindnesses of
servants of God, who for the sake of God and of yourself

provide us with food. For lie has written to the abbat of the
Cistercians, 66 that as he loves those abbeys of his order which
are in his power, so must he withhold from us all services and
attentions on part of his order. But why enlarge ? For,
notwithstanding my long suffering, to that degree has the
harshness of the king and his officers proceeded, that even
if any number of religious men whatsoever were to inform
you thereupon, even upon oath, I should be much surprised if
even then your Holiness would give any belief to their assertions.
Reflecting, therefore, upon these things with great anxiety of
mind, and the danger ensuing therefrom, both to the king
and to yourself, I have publicly condemned these pernici-
ous, I will not say customs, but perversions or corruptions,
by which the Church of England is disturbed and confounded,
together with the writing and the authority of the writing by
which they were confirmed ; as also the observers, enforcers,
and defenders of the same. I have also in general terms ex-
communicated his abettors, advisers, and coadjutors, who-
soever they may chance to be, whether clergy or laity, and
have absolved my bishops from the oath by which they
have been violently forced to the observance of the said cus-
toms. But these are the points which, in this writing, I have
especially condemned : ' Appeal shall not in any case be made
to the Apostolic See, except with the king's permission. It is
not lawful for a bishop to take cognizance of perjury or
breach of faith. It is not lawful for a bishop to excom-
municate any person who holds aught of the king in capite,
or his lands, or to lay an interdict upon any one of his officers
without the king's permission. Clerks, or those of the re-
ligious orders, are to be brought before secular tribunals;
laymen, whether the king or other persons, are to take cogni-
zance of causes as to churches or tithes. It is not lawful for
an archbishop or bishop to depart from the kingdom, to attend
the summons of our lord the pope, without the king's per-
mission ; ' and other enactments to a like effect. By name also
I have excommunicated John of Oxford, who has held com-
munion with that schismatic and excommunicated person,
Reginald of Cologne ; and who, contrary to the mandate of
our lord the pope, and of ourselves, has taken unlawful pos-
session of the deanery of the church of Salisbury, and, at
the court of the emperor, has administered the oath for the
65 At Pontigny.



A.D. 1167. LETTEB OF THE POPE TO KING HENRY. 295

supporting of that schism. In like manner also, I have de-
nounced and excommunicated Richard of Ivechester, because
he has fallen into the same damnable heresy, by holding
communication with that most notorious schismatic at Cologne,
and inventing and contriving all kinds of mischief, with those
schismatics and Germans, to the destruction of the Church of
God, and more especially of the Church of Rome, according to
the treaties agreed upon between the king of England and
them, and Richard de Lucy and Jocelyn de Baliol, who have
been the encouragers of the royal tyranny, and the fabricators
of these heretical corruptions. I have also excommunicated
Ranulph de Broc, Hugh de Saint Clair, and Thomas Fitz-Ber-
nard, who, without our license and consent, have seized the pro-
perty and possessions of the church of Canterbury. I have ex-
communicated all besides who, contrary to our will and assent,
have laid hands upon the property and possessions of the church
of Canterbury. The king, however, I have not as yet personally
excommunicated, being still in expectation of his reformation ;
him, however, I shall not delay to excommunicate, if he does
not speedily recover his senses, and submit to discipline for
what he has done. To the end, therefore, most holy father,
that the authority of the Apostolic See, and the liberties of the
Church of God, which in our country have almost perished, may
be enabled to be in some measure restored, it is necessary,
and in every way expedient, that you should entirely ratify,
and by your letters confirm, what I have done. Farewell,
and may your Holiness enjoy all happiness."

The Letter of Pope Alexander to Henry, king of England.

"The bishop Alexander, servant of the servants of God,
tQ his beloved son, Henry, the illustrious king of the English,
health and the Apostolic benediction. With what paternal and
kindly feelings we have often convened your royal excellence,
and have frequently exhorted you, both by letters and our
nuncios, to become reconciled to our venerable brother Thomas,
archbishop of Canterbury, and to restore to him and his
clerks their churches, with the other things which you have
taken from them, the prudence of your highness is by no
means unaware, inasmuch as it is public and notorious to
nearly the whole of Christendom. Wherefore, seeing that we
have hitherto been able to make but little progress in this
matter, or by kind and gentle conduct to soothe the emotions

of your mind, we are rendered sad and sorrowful, and grieve
that we are disappointed in. our hopes and expectations ; particu-
larly as we love you sincerely as our most dearly-beloved son
in the Lord, and we see this great danger threatening you ; and
inasmuch as it is written, ' Cry aloud, and spare not ; lift up thy
voice like a trumpet, and show my people their transgression ;' 66
and likewise, ' If thou dost not warn the wicked from his way,
his blood will I require at thy hand ; ' 66 * and by Jeremiah,
the slothful man was ordered to be stoned with the dung of
oxen. We have determined no longer to bear your hard-
ness of heart as heretofore, to the detriment of justice and your
own 67 salvation ; nor will we for the future close the mouth of
the said archbishop in any way, or prevent him from freely
doing his duty, and avenging with the sword of ecclesiastical
severity the wrongs which have been done to himself and to
the Church entrusted to his charge. Now, as to the points
which are contained in this letter relative to the matters before-
mentioned, as also others of less importance, our well-beloved
brother, the prior of Mont-Dieu, and the brother Bernard de
Corilo, men who indeed pay more respect to God than to
kings, will in words further explain to your highness. May
He, to pay obedience to whose admonitions is to reign, and in
whose hands are the hearts of princes, incline your mind and
will, that so you may be prevailed upon rather, than, against
God and your salvation, persist any longer in so determined a
course of obstinacy. But if even now you shall refuse to
hearken to the proposals which they shall make to you in my
behalf, then without doubt you will have occasion to fear what
is to ensue, and to dread the Divine vengeance in the world to
come."

The Letter of the Messed Thomas, the Archbishop of Canterbury,
to Gilbert, Bishop of London.

"Thomas, the humble minister of the church of Canter-
bury, to Gilbert, bishop of London, may he, now as always,
so pass through good things temporal as not to lose those
eternal. It is a cause for wonder, indeed, for extreme as-
tonishment, that a man of prudence, well versed in Holy
Scripture, and especially wearing the appearance of religion,
should, laying aside the fear of God, so manifestly, not to say

irreverently, set himself against truth, oppose justice, and, to
the utter confusion of all right and wrong, seek to overthrow
the establishment of the Holy Church, which the Most High
hath founded. For it is the Truth which says, ' the gates of
hell shall not prevail against it.' He is generally supposed not
to be of sane mind who intends the ruin thereof, and is like a
man who binds a rope around a vast mountain, and attempts to
throw it down. But is it because I am inflamed with anger or
with hatred, that, in my exasperation, I am driven to utter
words of this nature against my brother, and colleague, and
fellow-bishop ? God forbid ! But to the above effect have I
collected from your letter, which I received through your arch-
deacon ; nor was I enabled thereby to gather grapes of thorns,
or figs of thistles. That it may be clear whether or not it is
BO, let us examine it, and bring its contents to the light. The
end, when compared with the beginning, presents a very strong
resemblance to a scorpion. The one approaches us, using smooth
and gentle language, the other, stinging us severely, attempts
to impose silence upon us. For, what else is it, first to acknow-
ledge your dutiful subjection to us, and to promise obedience
in conformity with that subjection, and then, in the end, to have
recourse to appeal, in order that you may not be obliged to obey ?
The Apostle says, ' Do I purpose that with me there should be
yea, yea, and nay, nay ?' 68 As the Apostles could not always be
with the disciple, of necessity did the disciples receive power
from the Lord of treading upon serpents and scorpions ; for even
unto this day Ezekiel 68 * is dwelling with the scorpions. And
now consider in what sense you say, ' We do have recourse to
the remedy of appeal ?' You call yourself a follower of Christ ;
in this speech you are found to be far otherwise. For the effica-
^ ious, nay, rather the most efficacious remedy of all our evils,
namely, Christ, has recommended to us obedience, not only in
word, but by His most evident example, inasmuch as He became
obedient to His Father even unto death. And with what grace do
you call that a remedy which is an impediment to obedience ?
Not a remedy, indeed, but, more properly, a hindrance ought it
to be called. But on what grounds do you rest your confidence
in this presumption ? Is it that you expect to find a defender
of your disobedience in him who has received the office and
the command to take cognizance of all acts of disobedience ?
It were wrong in you to expect this of him, 69 and greatly
68 2 Cor. i. 17. <* According to Ezekiel ii. 6. 69 The pope.



298 AXNALS OF ROGER DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1167.

to be mistaken in him. You might have been withheld from
a supposition of that kind by the first and second repulses
you have already experienced. For, in the first place, you
appeared personally ; after which, the letter which you wrote
for the purpose of persuading him experienced how firmly
stands the vicar of Saint Peter, and with what truthful-
ness, when, neither by prayers, nor by gifts, nor by suggestions,
nor by promises, could you move him. But a third attempt
must be made, that, after the example of his lord, he may, on a
third attempt, come off triumphant. Besides, that no annoy-
ance may be wanting, you have put off the time for your ap-
peal nearly a whole year. You have had no compassion on
my exile or on the difficulties of the Holy Church, the spouse
of Christ, whom He has obtained with His own blood. Besides,
to pass this over, which, indeed, I ought not to do, it was your
duty to use some foresight in his behalf, to whom you assert
yourself to be a well-wisher, I mean our lord the king, who,
so long as he behaves thus towards us, or the Church of
Christ, will be able neither to go to war, nor to live in
peace, without danger to his soul. Let us now pass on to the
rest. You mention that some confusion arose on my depar-
ture, and in consequence of my departure. Let the authors
and contrivers of this confusion be afraid, lest they also be
brought to confusion. You extol me with great praises, as to
the good purpose of my journey, and indeed it is the duty of a
prudent man not to be neglectful of his character ; but still, it
is the part of a discreet one, in relation to himself, not to be-
lieve another rather than himself. I am accused as though
I had done certain injuries to my lord the king ; but inas-
much as you do not mention one of them by name, I do not
even know what it is I am to make answer to ; therefore, as I
am only charged in a superficial manner on that point, in a
superficial manner only shall I defend myself. In the mean-
while, however, take this for my answer because I am con-
scious of having done nothing wrong, for that reason I have
not justified myself. You express surprise at the letter of
warning which I sent him. What father sees his son going
astray and holds his peace ? What person is there that does
not smite another with the rod, that he may not run upon
the sword ? The father despairs of the son whom he does
not correct with threats or the scourge. However, God forbid
that I should think as you do, that our lord, growing impatient






A.D. 1167. THE ARCHBISHOP TO THE BISHOP OF LONDON. 299

under correction, will by degrees proceed to the extermination
of the seceders ! 70 For the plantation of our heavenly Father
will not be rooted up. A most violent tempest is now toss-
ing the ship ; I have hold of the helm, and do you invite
me to sleep ? Do you collect and place before my eyes the
benefits that have been conferred upon me by our lord the king,
and speak of my being elevated from a lowly state to the
highest position ? Still, in my simplicity, to give you some
small answer, what lowly state is it you are thinking of?
If you look at the time at which he placed me high in his
service, there were the archdeaconry of Canterbury, the
priorship of Beverley, many benefices, several prebendal
stalls, with other things, not a few, which, at that period at-
tached to my name, go far to disprove that I was in such a low
position as you affirm, with relation to the things of this
world. And if you look at the origin of my family and my
ancestors, they were citizens of London, who dwelt in the midst
of their fellow-citizens without reproach, and persons by no
means of the lowest station. But as, one day, when the darkness
of the world is removed, we shall be judged by the light of truth,
which will be the most glorious, to have been born of humble
parents, or even those of the lowest rank, or of the great and
honored ones of the world ? For the Apostle says : ' Those
members of the body, which we think to be less honorable, upon
those we bestow more abundant honor.' 71 ' What do pedigrees
avail ?' says the heathen poet. What then ought a learned and
religious Christian bishop to say? But perhaps, by your
mention of my lowly condition, it was your intention to put
me somewhat to confusion ; however, how criminal it is to
put one's father to confusion, you yourself will see from the
commandment of the Lord, which you have received as to
"honoring your father. But, as for commending the king's favour
to me, there was no great need to take the trouble of recapi-
tulating his services done to me. For I call the Lord as my
witness that nothing under the sun do I prefer to his favour
and safety, save only those things which belong to God and to
the Holy Church ; for otherwise it will not be possible for him
to reign with happiness or with safety. As it is, so be it.
There are many other favours, and still greater ones, than are
mentioned in your letter, which I have received at his hands.

In return for all these, even if they were to be doubled, ought
I to peril the liberties of the Church of God, much less for the
preservation of my own character, which has so frequently
swerved from what is right ? If I have acted with greater
forbearance towards others, in this I will spare neither you.
nor any one else, not even an angel, if he were to come down
from heaven, but the instant I should hear him suggesting such
a course, he should hear from me these words, ' Get thee behind
me, Satan, thou savourest not the things that are of God !' 71
Far from me be such madness as that ! May the Lord avert
such insanity from me, that any one should persuade me, by
any backsliding, to make a bargain about the body of Christ ;
for, in such case, I should be likened to Judas, the seller of our
Lord to the Jews, the buyers of Christ ! But as to my pro-
motion, which you state in your letter to have taken place,
the mother of my lord the king dissuading him therefrom, the
kingdom exclaiming against it, and the Church, so far as she
could, heaving sighs thereat, this I tell you in answer thereto.
I did not hear exclamations on the part of the kingdom, but
rather acclamations ; and if there was any dissent on the
part of my lord's mother, they did not come to the ears of the
public. It might possibly be the case that some ecclesiastics
did sigh upon that promotion, as aspirants 72 generally do,
when they found that they were disappointed in the hopes
they had once entertained. And, possibly, at this day, it is
those same persons who, by way of revenge for their mis-
fortune, are the authors and advisers of the present dissen-
sions. But ' Woe to him by whom offences come !' Against
the aforesaid obstacles, and against others, if any there were,
the dispensations of God prevailed, as we may at this day per-
ceive. For I am compelled by Him, who is justice itself, to
postpone Him for nothing whatsoever, who in His mercy has
placed me in this position. The points, also, which you seem
to put forward, by way of justifying the king, I think ought
not to be lightly passed over, or without some discussion ; and
I could only wish that he had not taken so wide a departure
from justice, and that my complaints against him appeared
less just. You say that he is, and always has been, ready to
give me satisfaction. This you assert you can confidently say
and maintain. Hold then a moment, and answer these ques-

72 He seems to pun upon the resemblance of " suspiro," and " aspiro."



A.D. 1167. THE ABCHBISHOP TO THE BISHOP OP LOSTDOIT. 301

tions. When you say that he is ready to give satisfaction, in
what sense do you understand it ? You see those of whom
God says that He is the father and the judge, the orphans,
the widows, the fatherless, the innocents, and those who are
utterly unacquainted with this controversy which is going on
hetween us, you see these proscribed, and you are silent ; you
see the clergy banished, and you do not exclaim against it ;
you see others spoiled of their property, and loaded with
insults, and you do not reprove it; you see my servants
thrown into prison and confined there, and you hold your
peace ; you see the property of your mother church of Can-
terbury being made away with, and you offer no resistance ;
you see swords threatening the very throat of me your father,
and myself escaping with the greatest difficulty, and you ex-
press no sorrow ; still worse even, you are not ashamed to take
part with my persecutors, and in me, persecutors of God and
His Church, and that too, not in secret. Is this, then, giving
satisfaction, not to correct evils which have been perpetrated, and
day after day, to add to what is bad what is still worse ? But per-
haps you understand it in a contrary sense, and that to obey the
will of the unrighteous is to give satisfaction, according to the
words, ' I will make mine arrows drunk with blood.' 73 How-
ever, you will say to me, ' My father, of what do you accuse
me ? I will acquit myself in a few words. I am afraid for my
gown.' It is true, my son, and too true what you say, and it is
for that reason, that you wield not the sword. But as to what
you say, that he is prepared to stand by the judgment of his
realm, as though, forsooth, that were a full satisfaction; who is
there on earth, or even in heaven, that would presume to pro-
nounce judgment with reference to the ordinances of God ? Let
human matters be pronounced judgment upon ; but let Divine
tilings remain utterly unshaken, and be left alone. How much
better would it be, my brother, how much more healthful for
him, and more safe for yourself, if you were to labour in
every way to disclose to him and to persuade him, what is the
will of God with reference to maintaining the peace of His
Church, and to warn him not to covet those things which do
not belong to his administration, and to remind him to honor
the priests of God, not giving heed to who they are, but whose
servants they are. You charge me with having been warped
by prejudice against the bishop of Salisbury and John of

Oxford, not a dean as you call him, but the usurper of a
deanery. But you ought to bear in mind that certain mani-
i'estoes 74 preceded my judgment. You say too, that you have
been moved thereby; how should you not? Ucalegon trembles
when Ms neighbour's party- wall is on fire; 75 and I only
wish that you may be becomingly moved from the position
which you have so unbecomingly taken up. Let then
my lord, at your intimation, know and understand, that He
who rules not only the kingdom of men, but of angels as
well, has ordained under Him two powers, princes and priests ;
the one earthly, the other spiritual ; the one to minister, the
other to warn ; to the one of whom He has conceded power,
to the other He has willed respect to be shown. But he
who withholds aught of his rights from the one or the
other, resists the ordinances of God. Let not my lord then
disdain to show respect to those to whom the Supreme ruler
of all has not disdained to show respect ; ' I have said ye are
Gods,' 76 and again, ' I have made you a God unto Pharaoh,' 76 *
and 'thou shalt not revile the Gods;' 77 meaning the priests.
And again, when speaking by Moses of him who was about to
swear, he says, ' Bring him unto the Gods,' that is to say, the
priests. And let not my lord presume to attempt to pronounce
judgment on his judges. For to the earthly powers are not en-
trusted the keys of heaven, but to the priests. Wherefore it
is written, ' the priest's lips shall keep knowledge, and they
shall seek the law at his mouth, for he is the messenger of
the Lord;' 77 * and Saint Paul says, ' Shall we not judge
angels ? How much more men.' 78 That also, at your suggestion,
should be brought to our lord's recollection as worthy of remem-
brance and imitation, which we read in Ecclesiastical History
concerning the emperor Constantine, to whom when there had
been presented written accusations against the bishops, he
took the libels, and, calling the accused before him, in their
sight, burned them, at the same time saying : ' Ye are gods,
made so by the true God. Go settle your disputes among
yourselves, for it is not fitang for us men to give judgment on
gods.' Oh mighty emperor ! Oh discreet ruler upon earth ! one

who did not fraudulently usurp that which belongs to another,
and thus earned an eternal kingdom in heaven. Therefore,
let my lord make it his study to imitate a prince so mighty, so
discreet, and so prosperous ; who enjoys both a praiseworthy
memory upon earth, and an eternal and glorious life in heaven.
Otherwise, let him fear what the Lord has threatened in
Deuteronomy,' 9 saying : ' The man that will do presumptuously,
and will not hearken unto the priest, shall die before the
judge.' For unto this he has been called, and hereby the
temporal peace and mightiness of his kingdom, of which you
remind me, is ministered unto him from heaven. Otherwise,
notwithstanding his many virtues, the king will not be saved,
even though kingdoms should be subdued by him, and nations
should be prostrate. But enough upon these points. Whoever
you have had as your fellow- writers in the aforesaid letter, let
them understand that this answer made to you is an answer to
themselves. For the future, my brethren, I warn you, I beg and
entreat of you that schisms may not separate, nor enmities over-
shadow us ; but let us have one heart and one soul in the Lord,
and let us listen to Him who telleth us to struggle for justice with
all our soul, and to contend for it to the death, and the Lord
will conquer for us our enemies. And let us not forget that
strict judge, standing before whose tribunal the truth alone shall
judge us, all dread of and trust in the powers of 'this world
beiug laid aside. Farewell to your brotherhood in the Lord."

The Letter of the suffragans of the Church of Canterbury to
the blessed Ilwrnas, archbishop of Canterbury.

"To their venerable father and lord, Thomas, by the grace
of God, archbishop of Canterbury, the suffragan bishops of that
church and the beneficed clergy appointed over the various
places throughout their dioceses, due submission and obedience.
\\Ticreas, father, on your departure for foreign parts, through
the very unexpectedness and novelty of the circumstance, con-
siderable confusion arose, still, we did hope, through your hu-
mility and prudence, with the aid of the Divine favour, for a re-
turn therefrom to the serenity of our former peaceful state. That
was, indeed, a solace to us, which, after your departure, reached
us all by general report ; that you, while passing your time
in the parts beyond sea, had no ulterior designs ; that you
were guilty of no machinations against our lord the king or
18 xvii. 12. The way the text is quoted differs from our version.



304 AXNA1.S OF BOGEK DE HOVEDE1T. A.D. 1167.

against his kingdom, but endured with moderation the burden
of poverty which you had spontaneously taken upon yoiirself ;
that you were devoting your time to reading and prayer, and
were atoning for the loss of time past by fastings, watchings,
and tears, and, occupied in spiritual pursuits, were making
your way, by the increase of your virtues, to the perfection
of blessedness. We rejoiced to hear that by pursuits of this
nature you were applying yourself to the restoration of the
blessings of peace ; and, in consequence thereof, we did enter-
tain a hope that you would be enabled also to bring the heart
of our lord the king to feelings of graciousness, so that, in his
royal clemency, he might cease to be angered against you, and
no longer recall to mind the injuries that had been inflicted
upon him in your departure, and in the consequences thereof.
Your friends and well-wishers did enjoy some access to him
while these things were heard of you, and when they made
entreaties for the bestowal on you of his favour, he re-
ceived each with benignity. But now, from the information
of certain persons, we have learned that which we recall to
mind with anxiety, namely, that you have issued against him
a letter of warning, in which you omit the salutation, and in
which you do not make any attempt to gain his favor, or have
recourse to entreaties ; in which you neither breathe nor write
aught in a friendly spirit; but, on the contrary, with extreme
severity, you declare in the threats which you utter against
him, that you will shortly have to pronounce against him
an interdict or else sentence of excommunication. Now,
should this be carried out with as much severity as it has been
asserted with harshness, we then no longer have any hope
that peace may succeed the present state of confusion, but are
greatly afraid that he will be inflamed to a lasting and inexo-
rable hatred. But the prudence of the devout takes into
consideration the results of things, using its best endeavours
that what it has commenced with discretion it may also bring
to a good end. Therefore, if so it please you, let your dis-
creetness consider to what it tends, and whether, by attempts
of this nature, it can obtain the end which is its object. As
for us, in consequence of these endeavours, we have fallen
from great hopes, and after conceiving the hope of at some
time obtaining peace, we now find ourselves repelled
by deep despair from the very threshold of hope. And
thus, while the combat is being waged as it were with the



A. D. 1167. LETTEB OF THE StTFFEAGANS OF CANTEBBUBT. 305

sword drawn, there is no room whatever to be found for
entreaty in your behalf. Therefore do we write to our father
what in our Christian love is our advice to him, not to super-
add difficulties to difficulties, injuries to injuries, but rather,
desisting from threats, to observe patience and humility. Let
him entrust his cause to the Divine clemency, to the favour and
mercy of his lord, and, thus doing, let him heap and gather
hot coals of fire upon the heads of many. By thus acting,
brotherly love will be excited, and, the Lord inspiring and
the advice of the good prevailing, perhaps piety alone would
be enabled to do that which threats have proved unable. It
would be as well for you to be spoken of in terms of praise
for your voluntary submission to poverty, as, for ingratitude
for benefits received to become the subject of general remark.
For all persons have a full recollection how kind the king our
master has shewn himself towards you, to what a pitch of glory-
he has raised you from an humble station, and how he has with
feelings so joyous received you into his especial favor, that the
whole of the various portions of his dominions, which extend
from the northern ocean to the Pyrenees, he has rendered sub-
ject to your power ; so much so, that in them public opinion
considered those only as fortunate who were able to find grace
in your eyes. And, that no worldly fickleness might be able
to shake your glory, he has willed immoveably to root you in
the things which belong to God. While his mother dissuaded
him, the kingdom expostulated, the Church of God, so far as
she could, sighed and groaned, he made it his object, in every
possible way, to raise you to that elevated post which you
now enjoy, hoping that he should for the future reign hap-
pily, and, amid the greatest security, rejoice in your aid and
counsel. If, then, he receives injury where he looks for secu-
riff , what will be the remark made on you by the voice of all ?
"What will be your reward, or what your character, in con-
sequence of your having made such a return as this ? Do, then,
if so it please you, spare your own character, spare, too, your
own fame, and, in humility, endeavour to surpass our lord,
and, in Christian charity, your son. If, however, our advice
cannot prevail upon you to do this, at least the love and
fidelity of the Supreme Pontiff, and of the holy Roman Church,
ought to influence you. For you ought easily to be persuaded
not to wish to make any attempt which may increase the labours

of your mother, who has now laboured so long, by causing her
grief, which deplores the disobedience of many, to be increased
by the loss of those who are obedient. For what if, and God
forbid it should be so, through your irritation of him, or by
your agency, our lord the king, whom people and kingdoms
follow and obey, the gift of the Lord, should withdraw from
our lord the pope, and decline to follow him for the future,
after his refusal to give him satisfaction against you ? For,
what entreaties, what gifts, what promises, and how many of
them, are strongly urging him to this step ! whereas he has
hitherto stood firmly upon a rock, and has victoriously, with
feelings of deep devotion, trodden under foot the whole that
the world could make offer of. One thing only do we fear, that
him whom these offers of riches, and the whole of that which in
the estimation of men is precious, could not influence, the indig-
nation of his feelings of themselves may be enabled to over-
come. Should this come to pass through your agency, you
will have entirely to adopt the lamentations of Jeremiah, and
in future will never by any means be enabled to deny unto
your eyes a fountain of tears. Recollect, therefore, if so
it please you, that the design of your highness, if it should
succeed, will in every way conduce to the injury of our
lord the pope and the holy Roman Church, and, if so it please
you, of yourself as well. But those who are near you, and
have deep designs, perhaps will not allow you to proceed upon
this path. They entreat you to make trial against our lord the
king who you are, and, in all matters which belong to him,
to exercise your utmost possible power. For what power is
there an object of fear to the sinful, of dread to him who refuses
to give satisfaction ? We do not, indeed, say that our lord the
king has never done amiss, but we do say, and aver with con-
fidence, that he has always been ready to make satisfaction to
our lord. The king, who has been so appointed by the Lord,
provides for the peace of his subjects in all things, that he may
be enabled to preserve the same for the churches and the
people entrusted to him, while, at the same time, the dignities
which were the due of and accorded to the kings before him,
he asks as his own due and to be accorded to him. Wherefore, if
any disagreement has arisen between him and you, having been
convened and warned thereon by the Supreme Pontiff, in his
paternal love, through our venerable brethren the bishops of
London and Hereford, he has not treated the same with super-



A.I). 1167. LETTER OF TILE SUFFRAGANS OF CANTERBURY. 307

ciliousness, but has shown that he does not require what does
not belong to him in all those matters in which any grievance
has been put forward relative to a church or any ecclesiastical
person, and has humbly and meekly made answer that he will
conform to the judgment of the Church of his kingdom ; which
he is also prepared to fulfil in deed, and to esteem it a pleasing
obedience when he is advised to correct the same, if he has
been guilty of any offence towards God. And, not only to
give satisfaction, but also to make reparation, if required, is
he prepared. If then, he is ready both to give satisfaction
and to make reparation to the Church in those matters which
concern the Church, and not in the least to shrink there-
from, thus bowing his neck to the yoke of Christ, with what
right, by what law, by what canon or interdict will you oppress
him, or, which God forbid, with what weapon of the Gospel will
you smite him r Not to be carried away by impulse, but to be
prudently regulated by the judgment, is a thing worthy of praise.
Wherefore, this is the common petition of us all, that you
will not give way to precipitate counsels, and thus betray us,
but rather by your paternal kindness make it your study to
provide for the sheep entrusted to your charge, that they may
enjoy life, and peace, and security. Indeed, that is a subject of
concern to us all, which we have lately heard of as being done,
preposterously as some think, against our brother the bishop
of Salisbury and his dean. Against them, following, as it
seems to us, rather the warmth of anger than the path of jus-
tice, you have hurled the penalties of suspension or con-
demnation before an enquiry has taken place as to their
faults. This is a new method of giving judgment, hitherto,
we trust, unknown to laws and canons, first to condemn for it,
and afterwards to take cognizance of the fault. This we beg you
ifot to attempt to put in practice against our lord the king and
his kingdom, or against ourselves and the churches and dioceses
entrusted to our charge, to the detriment of our lord the pope,
to the loss and disgrace of the holy Church of Rome, and to the
no slight increase of your own confusion. To such a course
on your part we oppose the remedy of appeal, having already
in the face of the Church personally made appeal to our lord
the pope against our fears of oppression. And now once more
do we appeal to him in writing, and we name the day of the
Ascension of Our Lord as the appointed time for our appeal.

Still, with all possible duteousness, we entreat you, adopting
more healthful counsels, to spare your own and our labour and
expense, and to make it your endeavour to place your case
in such a position that it may admit of a remedy. Father, we
wish you farewell in the Lord."

The Letter of the Suffragans of the Church of Canterbury to
Alexander, the Supreme Pontiff.

" To their father and lord, the Supreme Pontiff Alexander,
the bishops of the province of Canterbury, and the beneficed
clergy appointed over many places throughout their dioceses,
to their lord and father, the due service of love and obedience. We
believe, father, that your excellency will remember that, through
our venerable brethren, the bishops of London and Hereford,
you did, by letter to them some time since directed, convene
your dutiful son, our most dear lord, the illustrious king of
the English, and did advise him, in your paternal love, as
to the correction of certain points which seemed to your Holi-
ness in his kingdom to stand in need of correction. On re-
ceiving your mandate with due reverence, as is well known to
all, he did not thereupon give way to any ebullition of anger,
or with haughtiness despise to pay obedience thereto ; but
immediately thereupon, feeling gratitude for your paternal
correction, he submitted himself to the judgment of the
Church, repeating upon each point the commands which, accord-
ing to the tenor of your mandate, had been carefully given to
him thereupon ; that he would be obedient to the judgment ot
the Church of his kingdom, and that what in it should seem
worthy of correction, he would of his own praiseworthy
counsel, and, with a duteousness in a prince most commendable,
correct. From this determination he has not withdrawn, nor
does he intend to fall away from his promise : but, on the
contrary, whoever shall sit as judge, whoever shall take
cognizance, and whoever shall pronounce judgment, he him-
self, showing respect to the Divine mandates, and not putting
forward the pride of majesty, but rather, like an obedient son,
is ready in all things to submit to that judgment, and in a
lawful manner to show obedience to the sentence, and so prove
himself a prince bound to respect the laws. Wherefore, as
he submits himself to the judgment of the Divine laws, it is
not necessary, either by interdict, or by threats, or by the
goads of maledictions, to urge him to give the satisfaction



A.D. 1167. THE SUFFRAGANS TO POPE ALEXANDER. 309

required ; for his deeds do not in any way -withdraw themselves
from the light, nor do they in any measure need to fly to the
shade for concealment. For the king, who is in faith a most
devout Christian, in the bonds of chastity a most exemplary
husband, a preserver and defender of peace and justice of
incomparable activity, sets all his wishes thereupon, and is ani-
mated by every desire, that all scandals may be removed from
his kingdom, that all sins with their abominations may be ba-
nished therefrom, that peace and justice may universally pre-
vail, and that, amid profound security and pleasing quietude, all
things may rejoice and flourish under his rule. When, there-
fore, he learned that by the enormous excesses of certain in-
solent clerks the peace of his kingdom was in no slight de-
gree disturbed, showing to the clergy all due reverence, he
reported their excesses to the bishops, the judges of the Church,
in order that the spiritual sword might come to the aid of the
temporal, and the spiritual power might establish and conso-
lidate in the clergy that peace which he revered and cherished
in the people. On this occasion the zeal of both parties was
made manifest ; the judgment of the bishops taking this posi-
tion, that murder and similar crimes ought only to be pu-
nished in the clergy by deprivation of orders. The king,
on the other hand, was of opinion that this punishment was
not at all equal to the guilt, and that due care was not
had for the establishment of peace, if a reader or an aco-
lyte should be allowed to kill any man illustrious for his
exemplary piety or his high station, and then come off safe
with solely the loss of his orders. The clergy, therefore, in-
sisting that thus it has been ordained by heaven in favour of
their order, while our lord the king was for visiting guilt with,
ae he hopes, a justifiable hatred, and striving to root peace still
more deeply, a holy contention arose, which is excused, we
believe, before the Lord, by the single-mindedness of either
party. On his side, it is not from a love of dominion, nor with
the object of crushing the liberties of the Church, but from a
wish to establish peace, that our lord the king has made this
attempt that the customs of the kingdom and the dignities of
the kings which have before his time been observed in the
kingdom of England by ecclesiastical persons and peacefully
maintained, should be still upheld. And that, upon these points,
the cord of contention might not be prolonged to succeeding
times, and public notice be attracted thereto, the elders,



310 ANXALS OF ROGER DE HOVEDEK. A.D. 1167.

bishops, and other great men of the kingdom, having been
adjured thereupon by their faith and their hopes in God,
after having been informed upon the usage in time past, the
required immunities were openly discussed and published upon
the testimony of the chief men throughout the kingdom. This,
then, is the cruelty of our lord the king towards the Church of
God which has been so loudly exclaimed against throughout the
whole kingdom, this is his persecution, this is his malignity,
the reports of which have been spread abroad among ourselves
as well as in all other quarters. Still, in all these, if there is
anything contained that is dangerous to the soul, anything
offensive to the Church, he has promised all along, and does
most steadfastly promise, that, advised and moved thereto by
your authority, he will, with the most holy duteousness, by
reason of his reverence for Christ, and for the honor which he
professes to pay to the Holy Church, whom he confesses to be
his mother, and for the salvation of his own soul, correct the
same, according to the advice of the Church of his realm. And,
indeed, our father, our aspirations for peace, would, as we hope,
before this have obtained their wished-for end, if the asperity
of our father, the lord archbishop of Canterbury, had not
kindled afresh the anger that was now subdued and almost
extinguished. For he, from whose long-suffering we had hither-
to hoped for peace, from whose moderation a renewal of his
favour, has most harshly and irreverently made an attack upon
him whom he ought to have softened with his admonitions,
and to have subdued by well-deserving and meekness, by means
of grievous and threatening letters, little savouring of the de-
votedness of the father or the long-suffering of the priest,
upon the occasion of his lately taking proceedings against
certain disturbers of the peace. He has most bitterly
threatened sentence of excommunication against him, and
the penalties of interdict against his kingdom. If, then, his
humility is thus rewarded, what is to be done with him
when he is contumacious? If ready duteousness and obedience
are thus esteemed, in what way will punishment be inflicted
upon obstinate perverseness ? To these grievous threats,
things more grievous have been added. For upon certain faith-
ful and familiar friends of our lord the king, the first nobles
of the realm, who especially take part in the private coun-
sels of the king, and by whose hands the sovereign's inten-
tions and the business of the kingdom are carried out, he



A.D. 1167. THE STJFFBAGAKS TO POPE ALEXANDER. 311

has passed sentence of excommunication, and has publicly
denounced them as excommunicated, when they have been
neither cited nor defended, nor are, as they say, conscious of
having committed any fault, nor have been convicted or
made confession thereof. In addition to this, our venerable
brother, the bishop of Salisbury, when absent and undefended,
having neither confessed to or been convicted of any crime,
has been suspended from the sacerdotal and episcopal office
before the grounds of his suspension had been submitted to the
judgment of his brother bishops of the province, or indeed of
any one else. If, therefore, this method of passing judgment
is to be carried out with regard to the king, and with regard
to the kingdom, in so preposterous, not to say, irregular a
manner, what are we to suppose may be the possible conse-
quence ? For the days are evil, and find numerous pre-
texts for speaking ill of us, unless the bonds of peace and of
brotherly love, by which the sovereignty and the priesthood
are held together, are burst asunder, and we, together with
the clergy entrusted to our charge, depart hence, dispersed in
exile, or else, which God forbid ! withdraw from our fealty
to you, and are hurled into the evils of schism, and into the
abyss of iniquity and disobedience. For this is the shortest
possible way to the entire destruction of religion, and to the
subversion and ruin of both clergy and people. Wherefore,
let not, in the days of your Apostolate, the Church be thus
grievously subverted ; let not our lord the king and the people
his servants, be, which God forbid ! turned away from their
obedience to you ; let not the wrath of our lord the archbishop
of Canterbury, which, by the machinations of certain private
persons, is contrived to be levelled against him and his man-
dates, be enabled to work any grievance against our lord the
fcing, or his kingdom, or ourselves, or the churches committed
to our charge. To your highness, by word and by writing,
we have appealed, and have fixed on the Ascension of our
Lord as the day of our appeal, choosing, in all humility, to endure
whatsoever shall in all respects be pleasing unto your Holiness,
rather than suffer daily grievances, till we are wearied, from
his manifestations of loftiness of spirit, our deserts not meriting
the same. Beloved father in Christ, may the Lord Almighty
preserve the safety of your Church to avail even unto ages far
distant."



312 ANNALS OF KOGEK DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1168.

In this year Robert de Cheney, bishop of Lincoln, departed
this life, on the sixth day before the ides of January. In the
same year, Almaric, king of Jerusalem, took Babylon, and
rendered it tributary to himself.

In the year of grace 1168, being the fourteenth year of the
reign of king Henry, son of the empress Matilda, Eicharcl,
earl of Striguil, 82 assembling a great army, invaded Ireland,
and subdued the greater part of it, with the assistance of
Milo de Coggeham, a warlike soldier, and then, making a
treaty with the king at Dublin, received his daughter as his
wife, together with the kingdom of Dublin. In the same
year died Guido of Crema, the second anti-pope, and was suc-
ceeded by John, abbat of Struine, who was styled pope Calix-
tus. In the same year died Eobert, earl of Leicester, chief
justiciary of England.

The Letter of the blessed Thomas, archbishop of Canterbury, to
Gilbert, bishop of London, with reference to the sentence
pronounced against him.

" Thomas, by the grace of God, archbishop of Canterbury,
and legate of the Apostolic See, to Gilbert, bishop of London,
would indeed that he could say, his brother, may he turn
away from evil and do what is good. Your extravagances we
have borne with, so long as we could, and we hope that our
endurance and long-suffering, which have been to ourselves de-
trimental beyond measure, may not redound to the injury of the
whole Church. But inasmuch as you have always abused our
patience, and have not been willing to listen to our lord the
pope or ourselves in the advice which concerned your salvation,
but rather, your obstinacy has been always increasing for the
worse ; at length, the necessities of our duty and the require-
ments of the law forcing us thereto, we have, for just and mani-
fest causes, smitten and excommunicated you with the sen-
tence of anathema, and have cut you off from the body of
Christ, which is the Church, until you make condign satis-
faction. Therefore, by virtue of your obedience, and at the peril
of your salvation, of your dignity and of your priestly orders, as
the form of the Church prescribes, we do command you to ab-
stain from all communion with the faithful ; lest by coming in

contact with you, the Lord's flock may be contaminated to its
ruin, whereas it ought to be instructed by your teaching, and
taught by your example how to live."

The Letter of Thomas, archbishop of Canterbury, to the Chapter
of London, upon avoiding communion with those who are ex-
communicated.

" Thomas, by the grace of God, archbishop of Canterbury,
and legate of the Apostolic See, to the dean, archdeacon and
clergy of the church of London, health, and may they faith-
fully abstain from communion with excommunicated per-
sons. That ought not to escape your discernment, which
almost the whole Latin world acknowledges, how unrighte-
ously, taking the opportunity of the general schism, Gil-
bert, bishop of London, our brother, would that we could
say our true brother, has acted in the cause of the Church, and
has endeavoured to disturb the peace thereof. Still, with
great long-suffering we have hitherto endured this, while he has
always abused the same, and to his manifold errors has added
the crime of disobedience as well. We, therefore, being able no
longer to conceal this from ourselves, the necessities of our duty,
and the requirements of the law forcing us thereto, have publicly
excommunicated him, and we do enjoin you in virtue of your
obedience, and at the peril of your priestly orders and of your
salvation, forthwith to abstain from all communion with him, as
befits the faithful in Christ. Likewise, under the same penal-
ties, we do order you to avoid those whose names are hereunder
written. With a like sentence, also, God willing, we shall,
on the day of the Ascension, condemn those who have been
solemnly cited by us, unless in the meantime they shall make
satisfaction ; namely, Gilbert, archdeacon of Canterbury, and
Robert, his vicar, Richard de Ivechester, Richard de Lucy,
William Giffard, Adam de Cheringes, and those who, either at
the king's command or of their own rashness, have taken pos-
session of the property of ourselves, or of our clergy, as also those
who, by their aid or counsel, are known to have instigated the
feelings of our lord the king against the liberties of the Church,
and to the proscription and plunder of the innocent, and
those who hinder the nuncios of our lord the pope, and of
ourselves, from ministering to the necessities of the Church.
Let not your heart be disturbed hereat, or be afraid, inas-

much as by the mercy of God we are safe, under the pro-
tection of the Apostolic See, against the backslidings of the ma-
lignant and the subterfuges of appeals. These are the names
of those excommunicated Jocelyn, bishop of Salisbury, earl
Hugh, Ranulph de Broc, Thomas Fitz-Bernard, Robert de
Broc, clerk, Hugh de Saint Clair, Letardus de Norfleet,
clerk, j^igel de Saccaville, and Richard, the brother of William
de Hastings, who has taken possession of our church at New
Coton. Farewell."

T/ie Letter of the blessed Thomas, the archbishop, to Robert, bishop
of Hereford.

" Thomas, by the grace of God, the humble servant of the
church of Canterbury, to his venerable brother Robert, by the
same grace, bishop of Hereford, health and constant perse-
verance in justice and in the defence of mother Church.
For the glory of the Saints, and for the damnation of the
wicked it is necessary that offences must come : in tribula-
tions the elect are to be proved, who by patience gain for them-
selves a crown, and improve others by their example. But
woe unto those by whom offences do come ! Whereas, the
bishop of London has not abstained from giving offence,
but among other works of his notable wickedness, since he
has been delivered up unto Satan, has even gone so far as,
with insolent audacity and parricidal impiety, to lift up his
heel against his and your mother, the holy church of Canterbury,
in presuming to say that he owes no submission and will pay no
obedience to him by whom he was translated to his see ; and to
the weight of his condemnation has added this, that he would
be for causing the transfer of the archiepiscopal throne to the
see of London we do therefore entreat your brotherhood, in
whom we have full confidence, with all possible affection to
oppose the shield in defence of your mother, against this son of
Belial, who in the front of other Gentiles, like another Goliah of
Gath, has not been ashamed to come forth alone, by the Lord's
working, from the camp of the uncircumcised, and has not
feared to challenge to the combat the whole community of the
sons of the church of Canterbury, while he is thirsting for the
blood of their mother, and is forsaking the unity of catholic
concord. For he has written to our lord the pope, on be-
half of our brother the archbishop of York, beseeching him



A.D. 1168. THE ARCHBISHOP TO THE BISHOP OF HEKEFOBD. 315

with lying and deceitful testimony that he will allow him to
hear the cross throughout our province, supposing that some
great gain will be the result, if through hatred to our per-
son he shall be enabled in any way to inflict an injury upon
the Church to which by his canonical profession he owes duty
and obedience. But Christ, who from its first foundation,
amid various storms and many and great tempests, has guided
and cherished the church of Canterbury, has wrought mer-
cifully in that, in full consistory, his falsehood and wickedness
have been, by means of unexceptionable witnesses, made mani-
fest. Wherefore, in the first place I return thanks to God, and in
the next to yourselves and the rest of our brethren, who have
withheld yourselves from all communion with him from the time
that it was known that he had been condemned to excommuni-
cation, and have ordered by public notice throughout your see,
not only him, but the rest of those who have been excommuni-
cated among you, to be avoided. In this has been made manifest
your fidelity, and the constancy of your virtue has shone forth,
which has determined that the threats of public power and of
officials, equally with their blandishments, ought to be postponed
to the commands of God. You have set at liberty your con-
sciences, you have preserved your good name, while, both by
the words of truth, and by the example of fortitude, you have
taught that it is more becoming to obey God than man. In-
asmuch, therefore, as the love of God, diffused so greatly by
his Holy Spirit in your hearts, has gone forth to the public as a
testimony of your well-doing, all servile fear being repulsed and
laid aside, let this sincerity of yours feel assured that God will
speedily beat down Satan under your feet, and will bring the
contest to a happy issue ; and this, too, the more speedily
and gloriously, the more fervently and constantly your truth
sriall have been made manifest in the course on which you
have begun. Wherefore, in the love of God, we do beg and
entreat of you, and, by your fidelity, by your obedience, and
by the sincere affection which you entertain towards your
mother, the church of Canterbury, adjure you ; that in
order to maintain the dignity and the rights of the church of
Canterbury to which you have made profession of fidelity, you
will arise and come to our rescue against the above-named
archbishop, and send in writing to our lord the pope, and to
the court, a testimony of the truth, such as it befits her sons



316 AUNALS OF ROGER DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1168.

to bear for their mother church. For he who shall withhold
it on the occasion of so unjust an attack, beyond all doubt
ought to be esteemed as unfaithful, and worse than unfaithful,
and one against whom right would demand that all the faith-
ful should wage war even unto the death. Nor indeed can this
course be productive of any danger, inasmuch as the truth is
clear, and according to the saying, is manifest even to the
blind. 83 But inasmuch as he is cursed who withdraws his sword
from blood, and the evil-doer is to be scourged in order that the
wise man may be instructed to his salvation ; whoever does
not meet the parricide with a stone and a sword, renders him-
self subject to the curses of the law. For he appears to give
his consent thereto, who does not, when he can, reason with, or
hinder him who commits such excesses. And, in order that
it may not be more stringently demanded at our hands, if we
any longer conceal from ourselves the great and manifest
errors of those who persecute the Church and whom now for a
period of nearly a whole five years, we have endured with great
long-suffering, in hopes that they might come to a feeling of
repentance, we denounce to your brotherhood as publicly
excommunicated, Geoffrey, 84 archdeacon of Canterbury, and
Robert his vicar, Richard de Ivechester, William Grffard,
Earl Hugh, Richard de Lucy, Adam de Cheringes, as also those
who against the rules of the sacred canons have received ec-
clesiastical offices or benefices from lay hands, or taken unlawful
possession of them of their own authority ; and likewise those
who hinder the messages of our lord the pope, and of ourselves,
from treating the necessities of the Church. We do therefore,
by the authority of our lord the pope, and of ourselves, command
you that you will hold, and will cause to beheld throughout your
bishopric, these persons in suchwise as the discipline of the
sacred canons has prescribed in the case of persons solemnly ex-
communicated. We bid your brotherhood farewell in the Lord,
and may it remember in the prayers of the holy to pray for us
and the cause of God which is in our hands."

In the same year, Guido de Lusignan slew Patrick, earl of
Salisbury, when returning on a pilgrimage from Saint Jago
[of Compostella] ; in consequence of which, Henry, king of

England, being greatly enraged, banished him from Poitou.
On this, assuming the cross, he set out for Jerusalem, and
remained there in the service of Baldwin the Leper, king of
Jerusalem, and by reason of his probity, was greatly esteemed
by the king and chief men of that kingdom.

In order that the line of the Latin kings may be traced,
who ruled in the holy city of Jerusalem, down to the times of
Saladin, a few matters must be mentioned which had transpired
before this period. It is necessary, therefore, to know, that
after the taking of Antioch, Curberant having been overcome
by Robert, duke of Normandy, the city of Jerusalem was taken
by the Christians, and rescued from the hands of the pagans,
in the year of grace one thousand and ninety-nine ; on which,
by the choice of the whole of the army, Godfrey, duke of Lor-
raine, son of Eustace the Elder, earl of Boulogne, was elected
king of the holy city of Jerusalem. However, he refused to be
crowned ; saying, that he would never wear a crown of gold,
in the place where Christ had worn a crown of thorns.

On his death without issue, his brother, Baldwin, suc-
ceeded him in the kingdom, and was crowned king. He was
the first of the Latin kings who was crowned in the holy city
of Jerusalem : for before this period, as long as it had been in
the hands of the Christians, its kings were Greeks.

On the death of king Baldwin, his son, Baldwin, succeeded
to the throne, and was crowned, having an only daughter
to succeed him in the kingdom. On his decease, the chief
men of the kingdom sent for Fulk, the brother of Geoffrey,
earl of Anjou, and gave him in marriage the above-named
daughter of king Baldwin, together with the kingdom of Jeru-
salem ; on which they were crowned. By has wife, the
daughter of king Baldwin, king Fulk was the father of two
sons ; of whom, the first-born was named Baldwin, and the
other, Amauri. Baldwin succeeded his father Fulk in the
kingdom, and was crowned; and on his decease, without issue,
his brother, Amauri, succeeded him in the kingdom, and was
crowned. This Amauri took Babylon, and rendered it tri-
butary to himself. He reigned eleven years, and was father of
Baldwin the Leper, and of two daughters, of whom the eldest
was called Sibylla, and the other, Milicent.

Baldwin the Leper succeeded his father Amauri in the
kingdom, and was crowned. He reigned eleven years, but



318 ANNALS OP BOGER DE HOVEDMT. A.D. 1169.

would never take a wife. In his days God wrought many
wondrous things in his behalf in the land of Jerusalem. For
although he was afflicted with leprosy, still, a multitude of
the pagans was repeatedly routed by him and utterly de-
stroyed. This Baldwin the Leper, by the advice of his chief
men, sent for William, the marquis of Montferrat, and gave
him to wife his sister, Sibylla, together with the earldom of
Joppa. This marquis William had by Sibylla, his wife, one
son, named Baldwin, whom Baldwin the Leper made his
heir, and abdicating the kingdom, gave it to this youth Bald-
win, his nephew, and caused him to be clowned. Shortly
after, the marquis William, the father of the youth Bald-
win, who was now king, departed this life, and Sibylla, his
wife, the mother of the king, married the above-named Guido
de Lusignan. Shortly after this, king Baldwin the Leper
died, and the youth Baldwin, his nephew, reigned in his
stead two years and a half. Guido de Lusignan, the earl of
Joppa, gave Milicent, his wife's sister, in marriage to Amfrid
de Tours.

In the year of grace 1169, being the fifteenth year of the
reign of king Henry, son of the empress Matilda, Nigel,
bishop of Ely, departed this life ; Godfrey of Finchale, a vene-
rable recluse and holy monk, also departed unto the Lord.

In the same year, Henry, king of England, fearing that the
blessed Thomas, the archbishop of Canterbury, would pronounce
sentence of excommunication against his own person, and lay an
interdict on his kingdom, appealed in behalf of himself and
his kingdom, to the presence of the Supreme Pontiff; and
sending envoys to him, requested that he would send one
or two legates a latere to England, to enquire into the dis-
pute which existed between him and Thomas, the archbishop
of Canterbury, and terminate it to the honor of God and of
the Holy Church ; and also that the persons above-named,
whom the archbishop of Canterbury had excommunicated,
might in the meantime be absolved. Wherefore our lord the
pope wrote to the following effect :

The Letter of pope Alexander to Henry, king of England.
"Alexander the bishop, servant of the servants of God,

of God, and, as we believe, most faithful servants to your
royal highness, together with the letter which your excellency
transmitted unto us by their hands, we have received with
the more kindly feelings, and have with the greater favour and
honor granted the prayer thereof, the more fully we were
sensible that they had been sent by a mighty prince and most
Christian king : to whom, indeed, we wish, so far as with the
will of God we may, all glory and honor ; and whose advantage,
in every way in which we becomingly may, both we and our
brethren and the whole Church wish for the more ardently, the
more that in our greatest necessity we have experienced your
most devoted sincerity towards us. For our memory at no time
hereafter will be able possibly to lose the recollection of the
marks of duty shown to us by you at a time so opportune, nor
will they by any lapse of time be overshadowed in the sight of
the church. We have thought proper to send certain persons as
legates a latere, according to your request, although it seemed to
us most inconvenient and most difficult at this time to part with
any, when we are standing in need of the presence and counsel of
our brethren, and especially of those whom you require, being
not unmindful however, as we have already mentioned, of
your praiseworthy and distinguished dutifulness to us. These
we have thought fit to send to the presence of your highness,
with full powers to take cognizance of and give judgment upon
the ecclesiastical matters which are the subject of dispute be-
tween you and our venerable brother, the archbishop of Canter-
bury, as also, the controversy which exists between the said
archbishop and the bishops of your kingdom with regard to
the appeal made unto ourselves, and such other matters in
dispute in your kingdom as they shall be enabled to bring
to a satisfactory conclusion, and, according as the Lord shall give
them His assistance therein, to terminate the same in a can-
onical manner. "We shall by all means also forbid the said arch-
bishop in any way to attempt to molest, or disturb, or disquiet
either yourself, or your people, or the kingdom entrusted to
your government, until these matters in dispute shall have been
Drought to a legitimate conclusion. But, if the aforesaid arch-
bishop shall, in the meantime, pronounce any sentence upon
w Tarn worth.

you, or your kingdom, or any person in your realm, we do pro-
nounce the same to be null and void, and not in any way to
affect you. To put an end to such a course, and as a proof of
our wishes, you are, in case necessity shall arise for so doing,
to produce this present letter. But, otherwise, we do beg of
your serene highness, and strongly recommend you, not to let
this letter or the tenor thereof be known to any person whatso-
ever, but to keep it entirely secret. And as for those persons of
your household and your advisers, whom the said archbishop
has already subjected to sentence of excommunication, the parties
sent by us will, with the Lord's assistance, absolve them. But
if, in the meantime, any one of them shall be in fear of imme-
diate death, we do grant that he may be absolved by any bishop,
or religious and discreet man, on the oath being administered
to him, according to the custom of the Church, that if he shall
recover he will consider himself bound to obey our mandates."

Upon this, the above-mentioned legates of our lord the pope
having arrived in Normandy, certain of the suffragans of the
church of Canterbury wrote to the following effect :

" Cure is preferable to complaint. But, our sins requiring
the same, our holy mother the Church has been placed between
the hammer and the anvil, and, unless the Divine mercy shall
look down upon her, will shortly feel the blow of that hammer.
For, the wickedness of the schismatics waxing strong, for defend-
ing his faith and for his love of justice, our father has been exiled
by our other father from his country, and the hardened mind of
Pharaoh forbids him liberty to return to his see. Added to this,
in things spiritual as well as in things temporal the church of
Canterbury is sadly impoverished. Like a ship upon the sea de-
prived of her pilot, she is buffeted to and fro, and is exposed to
the winds, while, by the royal authority, her shepherd is for-
bidden to remain within the territories of his own country.
He, wise though he may be, at his own peril and that of his
Church, as also of ourselves, has, together with himself, ex-
posed us to the bitterness of penalties and of labours; not
reflecting that to use soothing methods will not detract from
his own power. And further, although with all our affec-
tions we sympathize with his sufferings, he has proved ungrate-
ful towards us, and, although we are in the same condemnation,
ceases not to persecute us. For, between himself and the
most serene king of the English, a certain controversy arose :



A.D. 1169. LETTEE OF THE SUFFRAGAN BISHOPS. 321

at the desire of both, a certain day was fixed upon, that, upon
the same, with the mediation of justice, an end might be put to
this controversy. Upon that day, in obedience to the royal
command, the archbishops, bishops, and other heads of the
Church, were convoked, in order that the more extensive
the council then held, the more manifest might be the ex-
posure of fraud and malice. On the day appointed, this
disturber of the kingdom and of the Church presents himself
before the face of the Catholic king, and, being distrustful of
the nature of his own merits, arms himself with the resemblance
of the cross of our Lord, as though about to come into the
presence of a tyrant. Nor yet even at this was the king's
majesty offended, but he entrusted the judgment of his cause
to the fidelity of the bishops, that so he might be free from
all suspicion. It remained, therefore, for the bishops to end
the dispute by pronouncing judgment, that they might thereby
bring the disputants to a reconciliation, and bury in oblivion the
causes of their dissensions. He, however, came thither, and
forbade sentence to be pronounced upon himself before the king,
that so the royal mind might be the more violently inflamed
to anger. The result of these excesses is, that the author thereof
is in b6 duty bound to expose himself to the vengeance of every
one, being ashamed to deprecate a merited retribution, in not
pausing at offending a most powerful prince in the days of the
persecution of the Church. For it is his offence that has re-
doubled the weight of the blows of persecution. It would
have been better for himself if he had placed a curb upon his
prosperity, lest, while striving presumptuously to arrive at the
summit of felicity, he might, in return for his presumption,
be thrust down to a lower place. And, if the misfortunes of
the Church did not move him, he ought at least to have been
dfssuaded from acting in opposition to the king by the advance-
ment, both in riches and honors, which the king had bestowed
upon him. Whereas, on the other hand, he faces him as an
adversary, and objects, that for him to stand in judgment
before the king would be a diminution of the dignity of
the Apostolic See. But if he was not aware that in that
judgment there was but little derogatory to the dignity of the
Church, still, it was his duty to have concealed his feelings for

corrupt state.

a time, in order that peace might be restored unto the Church.
Again, another objection that he takes, ascribing to himself
the title of father, is, that it seems to savour of arrogance for
sons to meet together for the condemnation of their father, a
thing that they ought by no means to do. But, if he really
had been a father, in the first place his humility would have
moderated the pride of his sons, in order that hatred of the
father might not spring up in those sons. Therefore, most holy
fathers, it is clear from what is stated above, that our adver-
sary ought to fail in his pretences, being actuated by the ma-
lignity of his hatred alone, and supported by no reasonable
grounds whatsoever, and inasmuch as the care of all the
churches is known at present to rest upon ourselves."

When Thomas, the archbishop of Canterbury, and some of
his fellow-exiles, came to an interview with the legates, on the
octave of Saint Martin, between Gisors and Trie, the legates
discoursed at length with the archbishop on the Christian
charity of our lord the pope, the anxiety which the Roman
Church had hitherto manifested in his behalf, their own
labours and the perils of their journey, the mighty power
of the king of England, the necessities of the Church, the
wickedness of the times, the love and kindness which the
king of England had manifested towards him, and the honor
which the king had always paid him. They also added the
complaints, and the injuries which the king of England com-
plained that he had suffered at his hands, laying it to his
charge, among other things, that he had excited the king of
the Franks to wage war against him, and sought his advice
how they might be enabled to appease such vast indignation,
because they were well aware that no remedy could be ap-
plied to such dangers without great humility, moderation, and
marks of respect.

But the archbishop of Canterbury, in all humility and meek-
ness of spirit, after duly returning thanks to our lord the pope
and to them, made answer to each point, upon true and pro-
bable grounds, showing the emptiness of the king's complaints,
and fully explaining the injuries and intolerable losses of the
Church. And, inasmuch as they required of him humility and
marks of respect, he answered that he would most willingly
show all humility, and the greatest possible honor and respect,
saving always the honor of God, the liberties of the Church,

the dignities belonging to his own person, and the possessions of
the churches; and if anything should seem to them to require
to be added, or to be taken away, or to be changed, he en-
treated that they would give him their advice, it being his fixed
determination to acquiesce therein, saving always the conditions
of his profession and orders. To this, however, they made an-
swer, that they had come not to advise him, but to seek his
advice, and to prepare the way for a reconciliation.

They also made enquiry of the archbishop, whether, in the
presence of the legates, he was willing to promise to observe
the customs which the kings had made use of in the times of
his predecessors, and thus, all complaints being hushed up, to
be reinstated in the king's favour, and return to his see and
the performance of his duties, and the enjoyment of peace by
him and his people ? To this the archbishop made answer, that
no one of his predecessors, under any of the kings, had been
bound to make this profession, and that he, with the help of
God, would never promise to observe customs, which were
openly opposed to the law of God, and, besides that, rooted out
the privileges derived from the Apostles, and destroyed the
liberties of the Church ; which, also, our lord the pope, at Sens,
in their presence, and in that of many others, had condemned,
and some of which, he himself subsequently thereto, following
the authority of our lord the pope, had subjected, together with
those who observed them, to the penalties of excommunication,
as the Catholic church in many councils is known to have done.

Upon this, he was asked to promise, if not a confirmation of
them, at least connivance and toleration on his part, or, not
making mention in any way of the customs, to return to his see
and his former state of tranquillity. To this the archbishop
made answer : " It is a proverb among the people of our na-
flon, that ' silence looks like assent;' " and observed that, while
the king would appear to be left in possession of these customs,
and would unjustly and violently compel the Church to the
Observance of them, if all opposition should cease, through
silence being obtained on his part, the authority of the le-
gates being interposed for that purpose, the king would
immediately appear to himself and to others to have gained
his point in the contest. He also added, that he would go
into exile, be perpetually proscribed, and, if God so ordained
it, die, in defence of justice, rather than obtain a peace of this

description, to the loss of his salvation, and to the prejudice of
the liberties of the Church. For that there is a God who, in
such a case, forbids the priesthood to be silent, and, in case
they dissemble, has prepared hell for their portion, where there
will be no dissembling of their punishment.

The book of the abominations 87 was also read by him, and
he made enquiry of the cardinals, whether it was lawful for
such things to be put in practice by Christians, much more
concealed from their pastors ?

They then proceeded to another question, enquiring whether
he would be willing to abide by their judgment upon the mat-
ters in dispute between himself and the king ? To this he
made answer, that he fully confided in the integrity of his
cause ; and that when he himself and his people, who had been
for a long time left destitute, should have been fully restored to
the enjoyment of everything, taking into consideration causes,
and circumstances, and times, he would readily obey the law,
and that he neither could nor would decline it, but, on the
contrary, both where, and when, and how, it should be his
duty, would submit to the judgment of him or them, by whose
judgment, whether one or more, our lord the pope should have
made it his determination to abide. That, in the meantime, he
and his people could not be urged on to litigation, and not even
poverty would have this effect, even though he should have
been in want of victuals, had he not been aided with money
by the most Christian king of the Franks. Yet he was unwil-
ling, at the first glance, to shrink from judgment, even though
he might have the best possible grounds for suspecting either
of them, lest he might thereby seem to justify the king's
cause, nor yet did he desire to engage in litigation before he
had been entirely restored, in order that he might thereby
be enabled to support his own cause.

At this time Louis, king of the Franks, collecting a large
army, entered Normandy, and burned the town of Andely,
belonging to Hotrod, archbishop of Kouen, Henry, king of
England, making no resistance thereto : this was done in
revenge for Chaumont, a fine castle belonging to the king of
France, which the above-named king of England had burned
in the preceding year by his Welchmen. In the same year,

tain practices therein censured by the Church.



AD. 1170. KING HENKY COMES TO LONDON. 325

Henry, king of England, took by storm a very strongly fortified
castle, which was called Finuel, and levelled it with the
ground . From the same year in which kings had ceased to reign
in Brittany, two earls had begun to rule in their stead. But,
inasmuch as all power is ever impatient of a partner, they
harassed each other with various dissensions. Conan at
length, by right of succession, having obtained both earl-
doms, when he died, left as his heir his daughter by the sister
of the king of the Scots. The king of the English taking her
as a wife for his son Geoffrey, and showing himself active in
the establishment of peace throughout Brittany, conciliated
the good feelings of both the clergy and the commonalty.

In the year 1170, being the sixteenth year of the reign of
king Henry, son of the empress Matilda, the said king Henry
kept the solemn festival at Nantes, in Brittany, on the day
of the Nativity of our Lord, which took place on the fifth
day of the week. After this, the king made a hostile attack
upon the lands of earl Eudo, 88 and laid waste nearly the whole
thereof, and compelled earl Eudo himself to surrender.

After this, in the first week of the month of March, he crossed
over from Normandy to England, between Barbeflet 89 and
Portsmouth ; on which passage, after being tossed about by a
most dreadful storm, from the hour of midnight until the ninth
hour of the following day, with great difficulty he reached
England and landed at Portsmouth. But nearly all the other
ships that were with him were broken and shattered, and
reached various ports of England just as the strength of the
gale drove them along. One of them, however, which was a
better and more recently built vessel than all the rest, but
more unfortunate, went down, together with Henry de Agnelles
^id his two sons, Gilbert de Sulemny, and master Ralph de
Beaumont, a physician, and one of the king's household, to-
gether with other men and women, to the number of four
hundred.

' Shortly after this, king Henry knighted David, the brother
of William, king of the Scots. In the same year, king Henry
passed the festival of Easter at Windsor. After this, the
king came to London, and there deprived of their offices nearly
all the sheriffs of England, and, having made inquisition as to
their levies upon the oaths of the people of his kingdom, fined

them. After this, at the feast of Saint Barnabas 90 the Apostle,
the said king held a great council at London, with the
nobles and chief men of his kingdom, upon the coronation of
his son, Henry ; and on the Lord's day following, which took
place on the seventeenth day before the calends of July, the
clergy and people assembling and agreeing thereto, he him-
self caused the above-named Henry, his son, to be crowned
and consecrated king at "Westminster, by Roger, arch-
bishop of York, who was assisted in this duty by Hugh,
bishop of Durham, Walter, bishop of Kochester, Gilbert,
bishop of London, and Jocelyn, bishop of Salisbury ; no men-
tion whatever being made of the blessed Thomas, archbishop of
Canterbury, to whom by right of his see the coronation and
consecration belonged. The day after this coronation, the
king, his father, made "William, king of the Scots, and David,
his brother, and the earls and barons of the kingdom, pay
homage to the new king, and swear 'fealty to him against all
men, saving their fealty to himself.

When it became known to Louis, king of the Franks, that
his daughter Margaret had not been crowned together with
her husband, the king of England, he assembled a large army,
and hostilely invaded Normandy. On hearing of this, the king of
England, the father, leaving the king his son behind in England,
crossed over into Normandy, and made peace with king Louis,
at a conference held at Vendosme, on the festival of Saint
Mary Magdalene, promising that next year he would cause his
son to be crowned again, and his wife with him. On returning
from this conference, the king, the father, came into Nor-
mandy, and was attacked at Motamgran 9 ' by a grievous
malady, on which he divided his dominions among his sons in
the following manner:

He gave to his son Eichard the dukedom of Aquitaine, and
all the lauds which he had received with his mother, queen
Eleanor ; and to his son Geoffrey he gave Brittany, with
Alice, the daughter of earl Conan, whom he had obtained as
his wife, from Louis, king of the Franks. To king Henry,
his son, he gave Normandy, and all the lands which had be-
longed to his father, Geoffrey, earl of Anjou. These three
sons he also made do homage to Louis, king of France. To

John, his youngest son, who was as yet an infant, he gave the
earldom of Mortaigne. A considerable time after this, king
Henry, the father, on recovering from his illness, went on a
pilgrimage to Saint Mary of Koquemadour.

In the meantime, the blessed Thomas, archbishop of Canter-
bury, now passing his sixth year in exile, made complaint to
Alexander, the Supreme Pontiff, against Hoger, the archbishop
of York, and the above-named four bishops who had assisted him
at the coronation of the new king, in the province of Canter-
bury ; whereupon, at his instance, the Supreme Pontiff excom-
municated the bishops of London, Rochester, and Salisbury,
and the archbishop of York, and suspended Hugh, the bishop
of Durham, from all his episcopal duties. For which purpose
he wrote to them to the following effect :

The Letter of pope Alexander to Roger, archbishop of York, and
Hugh, bishop of Durham.

"Alexander, the bishop, servant of the servants of God,
to his venerable brethren, Pu>ger, archbishop of York, and
Hugh, bishop of Durham, health and the Apostolical benedic-
tion. Although you have shown yourselves praiseworthy
and pleasing unto us in many respects, and we do sincerely
embrace you in the arms of Christian love ; still, for all this,
we ought not to omit that those things which have been done by
you, and which, remain unconnected, beget death, and to remind
you, and correct you in our zeal for what is right, as the Lord
says by His prophet, 92 ' When I say unto the wicked, thou
shalt surely die ; and thou givest him not warning, nor
speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his
Hfe ; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity, and his
blood will I require at thine hand.' For the persecution of the
English Church, and the diminution of her liberties which have
taken place through the conduct of your king, whether of his
own accord, or whether rather at the suggestion of others, have
for this long time past greatly afflicted our mind, and caused us
no small grief and anxiety. For whereas it was his duty to
have thought of correcting those things which have been wrong-
fully done by his predecessors, rather adding prevarications to
prevarications, he has both placed and established customs thus
evil under the protection of the royal dignity. Under these, both

328 ANNALS OF BOGEB DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1170.

the liberties of the Church are destroyed, and the decrees of the
successors of the Apostles are, as far as possible, deprived of their
validity. Nor has he thought that it ought to suffice, if under
him the Divine laws in the kingdom of England should be re-
duced to silence and to nothingness, unless he should also trans-
mit his sins to his heirs, and cause his kingdom long to exist
without the ephod and without the pall. 93 For this reason it is
that these usurpations, so unrighteous and so utterly unjusti-
fiable, he has caused to be confirmed by your oath, and by those
of others of our brethren and fellow bishops, and has pronounced
as an enemy whatever person should think fit to differ from these
unrighteous ordinances. This is proved by the exile of our ve-
nerable brother, Thomas, the archbishop of Canterbury ; this is
also shewn by the dreadful proscription of his clergy and kin-
dred, and of those even who, still hanging at their mother's
breasts, were crying in the cradle. Even the fear of death is
appealed to, if the mind of any one is aroused, in contradiction to
these enactments, a desire to obey the Divine laws. We ourselves,
by whose judgment those prevarications ought to have been
corrected or punished, were with much urgency on the occasion
of a time of trouble pressed to confirm the same. Strong en-
deavours were also made, and no efforts were spared, that we
might, at a time when they had not been explained to us, con-
fer upon these usurpations, the confirmation of the Apostolical
authority. This indeed took place at the very beginning. In
process oftime, however, the archbishop above-named being sent
into exile for having performed the duty of his pastoral office,
and frequently requesting from our assistance the customary aid
of the Roman Church, we sent to the king before-mentioned,
some of the best and most eminent of our brethren ; we also
sent other ecclesiastical persons, and did imagine that by our hu-
mility and forbearance his obduracy might be surmounted : and
so it should have been, for Solomon says, ' By long forbear-
ance is a prince softened, and a soft tongue breaketh anger.' 94
But he, trifling. with our long-suffering by the manifold arts
of his envoys, seems so utterly to have hardened his heart
against our advice, that he will not curb his wrath against

as the ephod.

the above-named archbishop, nor allow any portion to be
withdrawn, of those unrighteous statutes, but will rather
afflict the church of Canterbury with the entire loss of its
possessions, and by these means despoil it of its ancient dignity
in the ecclesiastical office. For lately, when he wished his
son to be crowned, despising the said archbishop, to whom
that duty is said of ancient right to belong, by your hand,
brother archbishop, he caused the crown of the kingdom to be
placed on his head in the province of another. Besides, at his
coronation, no surety was given, according to usual custom, for
preserving the liberties of the Church, or indeed, according to
report, even demanded ; but on the contrary, it is said to have
been confirmed upon oath, that it is the duty of all to keep
inviolate the customs of the kingdom, which they say were
established by his grandfather, and by reason of which the
dignity of the Church is endangered. Although in acting thus,
the obstinacy of the above-named king greatly vexes us, yet
we are still more moved by the weakness of yourselves and
of our other fellow-bishops, who, and with grief we say it,
have become as it were rams having no horns, and have fled
without courage from before the face of their pursuer. For
although, brother archbishop, it might possibly have been
allowable for you to act thus in your own province, still, how
it was allowable for you in the province of another, and of him
in especial, who was almost the only one to go forth in exile
for justice and thereby to give glory to God, we are unable to
discover either upon the grounds of common sense, or according
to the constitutions of the holy fathers. But should any one,
by way of excuse for so great a betrayal, make it an ob-
jection that in other kingdoms many and grave enormities
are perpetrated, in truth we can make answer, that we find no
kingdom that as yet has rushed into so great a contempt of the
Divine laws, as to cause enormities so manifest to be pro-
mulgated by the writings and oaths of bishops, unless, in-
deed, any one should have the impudence to bring that for-
ward, of which the schismatics who have been lately cut off from
communion with the faithful, have with damnable and un-
heard-of pride been guilty. Wherefore, inasmuch as, accord-
ing to the words of the prophet, the evil has been done among
you, to an extent beyond all other provinces in his usur-
pations, and after having confirmed these unrighteous cus-






330 AJfNALS OF EOGEE DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1170.

toms by oath, you have not aroused yourselves to resume the
shield of faith, in order that you might stand in the house of
the Lord in the day of battle, but have laid your bodies oa the
ground, that there might be a way for him to pass over you ;
and lest if we should be any longer silent, we might, together
with you, be involved on the day of judgment in the same sen-
tence of damnation, by the authority of the Eoman Church, of
which with the aid of the Lord we are the servant, we do sus-
pend you from all duties of the episcopal office, hoping that at
least, under discipline and paternal correction, you will return to
a sense of your duty, and, as you ought, apply yourselves to
defending the liberties of the Church. But if not even then you
resume the zeal that ought to belong to your ecclesiastical office,
then shall we, by the Lord's assistance, have recourse to that
which is now impending over you. Be it then your care that
that is not said to you, which was said to one by the prophet :
' Because thou hast rejected what is holy, I will also reject
thee, so that thou shalt be no priest to me.' 93 For, as we,
God so disposing, according to His good pleasure, are seen to
occupy the place of him who could be withheld from preaching
the word of God neither by stripes nor by bonds, we are
bound, not under an ambiguous expectation of peace, to place
the money of the Divine word which has been entrusted to us
in a napkin, and so keep it tied up until the hour for getting in
the profit thereof shall arrive, and the creditor coming shall
strictly demand of us an account thereof."

In the meantime, Louis, king of the Franks, and the arch-
bishops, bishops, and nobles of the kingdom of France, be-
sought the Roman Pontiff in behalf of the archbishop of Can-
terbury, by the love which they bore him, and with protesta-
tions of implicit obedience, no longer to admit the excuses
and delays which the king of England continually put for-
ward, as he loved the kingdom of France and the honor of
the Apostolic See. William, the bishop of Sens, also, being
astonished at the desolate condition of the English church,
repaired to the Apostolic See, and obtained of the Roman
Church, that, an end being put to all appeals, the king of
the English should be subjected to excommunication, and
his kingdom to interdict, unless peace were restored to the
church of Canterbury. Thus, at last, it pleased God, the
dispenser of all things, to recompense the merits of His dearly

A.D. 1170. AECHBISHO? THOMAS RETTJBNS TO ENGLAND.



331



beloved Thomas, and to crown his long labours with the vic-
torious palm of martyrdom. He, therefore, brought the king
of England to a better frame of mind, who, through the pater-
nal exhortation of our lord the pope, and by the advice of
the king of the Franks and of many bishops, received the
archbishop again into favour, and allowed him to return to
his church.

Accordingly, peace was established between the archbishop
and the king of England, on the fourth day before the ides of
October, being the second day of the week, at Montluet, be-
tween Tours and Amboise, upon which, everything being
arranged, they returned, each to his place. Thomas, the
archbishop of Canterbury, returned to the abbey of Saint
Columba, where he had resided for nearly the last four years.
But, one day while the said archbishop lay there, prostrated
in prayer before a certain altar in the church, he heard a
voice from heaven saying to him, " Arise quickly, and go unto
thy see, and thou shalt glorify my Church with thy blood, and
thou shalt be glorified in me." Thereupon, at the commence-
ment of the seventh year of his banishment, when he was
now beloved by God and sanctified by spiritual exercises, and
rendered more perfect by the sevenfold grace of the Holy Ghost,
he hastened with all speed to return to his see. For the pious
father was unwilling any longer to leave the church of Canter-
bury desolate ; or else it was, because, as some believe, he had
seen in the spirit the glories of his contest drawing to a close,
or through a fear that, by dying elsewhere, he might be
depriving his own see of the honor of his martyrdom.

As for his life, it was perfectly unimpeachable before God
and man. To arise before daybreak did not seem to him a
vain thing, as he knew that the Lord has promised a crown
lo the watchful. For every day he arose before daybreak,
while all the rest were asleep, and entering his oratory would
pray there for a long time ; and then returning, he would
awake his chaplains and clerks from their slumbers, and, the
matins and the hours 95 of the day being chaunted, devoutly cele-
brate the mass ; and every day and night he received three orfive
flagellations from the hand of a priest. After the celebration

' The " horae" were services performed with chaunts at certain hours
in the day : they were seven in number, and were styled " matutina,

of the mass, every day he re-entered his oratory, and, shutting
the door after him, devoted himself to prayer with abundant
tears ; and no one but God alone knew the manner in which
he afflicted his flesh. And thus did he do daily unto his flesh
until the hour for dining, unless some unusual solemnity or
remarkable cause prevented it. On coming forth from his
oratory he would come to dine among his people, not that
he might sate his body with costly food, but that he might
make his household cheerful thereby, and that he might fill
the poor ones of the Lord with good things, whom, according
to his means, he daily increased in numbers. And although
costly and exquisite food and drink were set before him, still,
his only food and drink were bread and water.

One day, while the archbishop was sitting at the table of
Alexander, the Supreme Pontiff, a person who was aware of this
secret, placed before him a cup full of water. On the Supreme
Pontiff taking it up, and tasting it, he found it to be the purest
wine, and delicious to drink; on which he said: "I thought
that this was water ;" and on replacing the cup before the arch-
bishop, the wine immediately returned to its former taste of
water. Oh wondrous change by the right hand of the Most
High ! Every day, when the archbishop arose from dinner,
unless more important business prevented him, he always de-
voted himself to reading the Scriptures until the hour of
vespers, at the time of sunset. His bed was covered with soft
coverlets and cloths of silk, embroidered on the surface with
gold wrought therein ; and while other persons were asleep, he
alone used to lie on the bare floor before his bed, repeating psalms
and hymns, and never ceasing from prayers, until at last, over-
come with fatigue, he would gradually recline his head upon
a stone put beneath it in place of a pillow : and thus would
his eyes enjoy sleep, while his heart was ever watchful for the
Lord. His inner garment was of coarse sackcloth made of
goats' hair; with which his whole body was covered from the
arms down to the knees. But his outer garments were remark-
able for their splendour and extreme costliness, to the end that,
thus deceiving human eyes, he might please the sight of
God. There was no individual acquainted with this secret
of his way of living, with the exception of two one of whom
was Robert, canon of Merton, his chaplain, and the name of
the other was Brun, who had charge of his sackcloth gar-

ments, and washed them when necessary ; and they were bound
by their words and oaths that, during his life, they would dis-
close these facts to no one.

After the transactions above related, archbishop Thomas
came to Witsand, but, upon hearing that Roger, archbishop of
York, and the bishops of London and Salisbury, were at Dover,
for the purpose of meeting him, he was unwilling to proceed
thither, but landed in England at Sandwich. Having thus
crossed the sea, the archbishop and future martyr was received
in his church with great thankfulness, and with honor and
glory, and especially by the monks, in solemn procession, all
weeping for joy, and exclaiming, as they gave thanks, "Blessed
is he, who cometh in the name of the Lord." But he, like a
good father, receiving them all with the kiss of peace, admo-
nished them with paternal exhortations, and instructed them to
love the brotherhood, to obey God, to persevere in doing good,
and to strive even to the death for the law of God.

At this period, Henry, king of England, the son of king
Henry, was in England, and the Nativity of our Lord was
approaching, which that king, with the nobles of his land,
was about to celebrate with the usual solemnities. To this
celebration it was the intention of the blessed Thomas, although
not invited, to go. However, when he had come to London,
Jocelyn, the queen's brother, came to him, and forbade him, in
the king's name, to go any further, upon which the blessed
Thomas returned to Canterbury.

Accordingly, again was this champion of Christ afflicted with
injuries and hardships still more atrocious, beyond measure
and number, and, by public proclamation, enjoined not to go
beyond the limits of his church. Whoever showed to him,
or to any one of his household, a cheerful countenance, was held
t8 be a public enemy. However, all these things the man of God
endured with great patience, and staying among those of his
own household, edified them all with his conversation and with
words of exhortation : and once more the archbishop took his
seat in his church, fearless, and awaiting the hour at which
he should receive from God the crown of martyrdom. For,
being warned by many beforehand, he knew that his lile
would be but short, and that death was at the gates. -

Upon this, as though he had but that moment commenced
to live, he used all endeavours, by spiritual exercises, to



334 ANNALS OF EOGEU DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1171.

redeem the moments of his past life ; and knowing that this
life is but a journey and a warfare, in order that he might be
sanctified in body, and disembarassed in spirit by vices,
armed with virtues, he girded himself up for the race, and pre-
pared himself for the struggle of the conflict. Therefore, in
finishing his race, he ran " not as uncertainly," and, in fight-
ing well, he did not "fight as one that beateth the air." 93
Then almost all his thoughts and discourse were upon the
end of this life and the troubles of its path. Sometimes,
also, in his discourses delivered to his brethren, the monks of
the church of Canterbury, and the clergy and people of that
city, he would say : "I have come to you to die among you."
And sometimes he would say : "In this church there are
martyrs, and, before long, God will increase the number of
them." This he said, signifying by what death he should
glorify the Lord.

At this period Henry, king of England, the father, alleged
that the archbishopric of Bourges of right belonged to the
dukedom of Aquitaine, but Louis, king of France, in every
way opposed that view. In consequence of this, a serious
disagreement arose between them, and each raised a large
army; upon which, the king of England with his forces
marched into Berry, as far as Montluc, with the intention of
going still further ; for, relying on the admission of the arch-
bishop of Bourges when on the point of death and stating in
his confession that by right the archbishopric of Bourges
belonged to the dukedom of Aquitaine, he was in hopes that
he should gain it. However, Louis, king of France, arrived
there before him, upon which, the king of England, being
deceived in his expectations, granted and accepted a cessation
of hostilities until the feast of Saint Hilary.

In the year of grace 1171, being the seventeenth year of
the reign of king Henry, son of the empress Matilda, the
said king was at Bure, in Normandy, on the day of the Nati-
vity of our Lord, being the sixth day of the week; and queen
Eleanor and his sons, Richard, Geoffrey, and John, were with
him. In the same year, his son Henry, king of England, was in
England. On the same day, the blessed Thomas, the arch-
bishop of Canterbury, being then at Canterbury, after delivering
a sermon to the people, excommunicated Egbert de Broc, who,
the day before, had cut off the tail of one of his sumpter-horses.
95 1 Cor. ix. 27



A.D. 1171. ASSASSINATION OF SAINT TKOMAS. 335

Hardly had the father been residing one month in his see,
when lo ! on the fifth day of the feast of the Nativity of our
Lord, there came to Canterbury four knights, or rather sworn
satellites of Satan, whose names were as follow : William
de Tracy, Hugh de Morville, Richard Briton, and Reginald
Fitz-Urse, men of families remarkable for their respectability,
but destined, by their daring to commit so enormous a crime,
to blemish the glories of knighthood and the honors of their
ancestors with perpetual ignominy. Accordingly, these persons
made their way into the presence of the archbishop, and, as
nothing salutary 96 was the object of their message, in the malice
they had conceived they omitted pronouncing any salutation,
and addressed him in an insolent and haughty manner.
Threats were exchanged on both sides, and threat was an-
swered with threat. At last, leaving behind them abuse
and insults, they departed : but, immediately after, they re-
turned and broke into the cloister of the monks, with a large
retinue of armed men, being also armed themselves. Now
the archbishop, with meekness and self-possession, had gone
before them to the choir of the church, the monks having
entreated, nay, forced him, on account of the solemnity of
the season, to perform the service at vespers. When he per-
ceived these armed men behind him, in the middle of the
cloisters, it might have been expected that their own malig-
nant feelings would have warned them to leave the church ;
but, neither did reverence for the solemn occasion dissuade
them from their crime, nor the innocence of the patriarch
prevent them from shedding his blood. Indeed, so entirely
had their shameless determination to perpetrate the crime taken
possession of them and blinded them, that they neither regarded
the disgrace to their knighthood, nor took account of any dan-
ger. Therefore, following the archbishop with headlong and
heedless steps, with drawn swords, they entered the church,
and furiously cried aloud, "Where is this traitor?" After
which, no one making answer, they repeated, " Where is the
archbishop?" Upon this, he, the confessor, and, shortly to be,
the martyr in the cause of Christ, being sensible that under
the first name he was falsely charged, and that, by virtue of
his office, the other belonged to him, came down from the

tatio," " a salutation."



336 AX^ALS OF ROGEE DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1171.

steps to meet them, and said, "Behold, here am I," showing
such extraordinary presence of mind, that neither his mind
seemed agitated by fear nor his body by trepidation.

On this, in the spirit of his frenzy, one of these fell knights
made answer to him, "You shall now die, for it is impossible
for you to live any longer." To which the bishop made an-
swer, with no less self-possession in his language than in his
mind, " I am ready to die for my God, and for asserting jus-
tice and the liberties of the Church ; but, if you seek my life,
in the name of Almighty God, and under pain of excommu-
nication, I forbid you, in any way, to hurt any other "person,
whether monk, or clerk, or layman, whether great or small,
but let them be as exempt from the penalty as they have
been guiltless of the cause." These words of his would serve
to express those of Christ in His passion, when He said, " If
ye seek me, let these go their way."

On this, the knights instantly laid hands on him and seized
him, that, for the perpetration of their design, they might
drag him out of the church, but were unable so to do. The
archbishop, on seeing his murderers with drawn swords, after
the manner of one in prayer, bowed his head, uttering these
as his last words, " To God and to Saint Mary, and to the
Saints, the patrons of this church, and to Saint Denis, I com-
mend myself and the cause of the Church." After this, amid
all these tortures, this martyr, with unconquerable spirit and
admirable constancy, uttered not a word or a cry, nor heaved
a sigh, nor lifted his arm against the smiter ; but, bowing
his head, which he had exposed to their swords, held it un-
moved until the deed was completed.

Upon this, the above-named knights, fearing the multitude
of persons of both sexes that came running to the spot, hast-
ened the perpetration of the crime, lest possibly it might
be left incomplete, and their intentions be frustrated thereby ;
and while one of them was extending his arm and brand-
ishing his sword over the head of the archbishop, he cut off.
the arm of a clerk, whose name was Edward Grimere, and
at the same time wounded the anointed of the Lord in the
head. For this clerk had extended his arm over the head of
the father, in order that he might receive the blow as he struck,
or rather ward it off thereby. The righteous man still stood
erect, suffering in the cause of righteousness, like the innocent
96 St. John xviii. 8.



A.D. 1171. ASSASSINATION OF ARCHBISHOP THOJIAS. 337

lamb, without a murmur, without complaint, and, offering him-
self up as a sacrifice to the Lord, implored the protection of
the Saints. And, in order that no one of these fell satellites
might be said to be guiltless in consequence of not having
touched the archbishop, a second and a third atrociously struck
the head of the suffering martyr with their swords, and clave
it asunder, and dashed this victim of the Holy Ghost to the
ground. The fourth, raging with a still more deadly, or rather
fiendlike, cruelty, when prostrate and expiring, cut off his
shorn crown, dashed in his skull, and, thrusting his sword into
the head, scattered his brains and blood upon the stone pave-
ment. In the mixture of the two substances the difference
of colour seemed to remind any one, who considered the matter
with due piety, of the twofold merits of the martyr. For, in
the whiteness of the brains was shown the purity of his inno-
cence, while the purple colour of the blood bespoke his martyr-
dom. With both these becomingly arrayed, as though with a
nuptial garment, the martyr Thomas was rendered a worthy
guest at the heavenly table. Thus, even thus, the martyr
Thomas become, by virtue of his long-suffering, a precious
stone of adamant for the heavenly edifice, being squared by
the blows of swords, was joined in heaven unto Christ, the
headstone of the corner. Wherefore this our Abel, being made
perfect by the glory of martyrdom, in a moment lived out
many ages.

Thus it was that, at the beginning of the seventh year of
his exile, the above-named martyr Thomas struggled even unto
the death for the love of God and the liberties of the Church,
which had almost entirely perished as regards the English
Church. He did not stand in fear of the words of the un-
righteous ; but, having his foundation upon a firm rock, that
is, upon Christ, for the name of Christ, and in the Church of
Christ, by the swords of the wicked, on the fifth day of the
Nativity of our Lord, being the day after Innocents' day, he
himself an innocent, died. His innocent life and his death,
as being precious in the eyes of God, innumerable miracles
deservedly bespeak, which, not only in the place where he rested,
but in divers nations and kingdoms, were wondrously shown.

On the same day the passion of the blessed Thomas was re-
vealed by the Holy Ghost to the blessed Godric, the anchorite,
at Finchale, a place which is distant from Canterbury more than

a hundred and sixty miles. The monks of the church of
Canterbury, on this, shut the doors of the church, and so the
church remained with the celebration of the mass suspended
for nearly a whole year, until they had received a reconcilia-
tion of the church 97 from our lord the pope Alexander. But
the monks took up the body of their martyr, and the first night
placed it in the choir, performing around it the service for the
dead. It is also said, and with truthfulness, that when they
had completed around the body the obsequies of mortality, and
while he was lying on the bier in the choir, about daybreak he
raised his left hand and gave them the benediction; after
which, they buried him in the crypt.

As for the knights who had perpetrated this unholy deed,
instantly becoming conscious of the heinousncss of their con-
duct, and despairing of forgiveness, they did not dare to
return to the court of the king of England, but retired into
the western 98 parts of England to Knaresborough, the town
of Hugh de Morville, and there remained until they had become
utterly despised by the people of that district. For all per-
sons avoided any communication with him, and no one would
eat or drink with them. The consequence was that they ate
and drank by themselves, and the remnants of their victuals
were cast out to the dogs, which, when they had tasted thereof,
refused to eat any more. Behold the signal and deserved ven-
geance of God ! that those who had despised the anointed of
the Lord should be despised even by dogs.

However, a considerable time after this, the four knights
above-named, who felt the accusation of their own consciences
for having perpetrated this deed, went to Alexander, the pope
of Rome, and, being enjoined by him to do penance, set out for
Jerusalem. Performing penance according to the pope's in-
junctions, they died at Montenegro, and were buried at Jeru-
salem before the doors of the Temple. The inscription on
their tomb was to the following effect : " "Here lie the wretched
men who martyred the blessed Thomas, archbishop of Canter-

The Letter of Louis, king of the Franks, to pope Alexander, on
the death of the blessed Thomas.

" To his lord and most holy father, Alexander, by the grace
of God Supreme Pontiff, Louis, king of the Franks, health and
due reverence. The man who commits violence upon his
mother revolts against human laws, and he remembers not the
kindness of his Creator, who is not saddened at violence of-
fered to the Holy See. But more especially is there ground
for condolence, and the novelty of a cruelty so unheard-of
arouses a novelty in sorrow, in that wickedness, making an
attack upon the holy one of God, has with the sword
pierced the beloved son of Christ, and more basely even
than cruelly stabbed him who was the light of the church of
Canterbury. Let an unheard-of kind of retribution be invented.
Let the sword of Saint Peter be unsheathed to avenge the
martyr of Canterbury; inasmuch as, for the universal Church
does his blood cry aloud, complaining not so much for himself
as demanding vengeance for the whole Church. Behold ! at
the tomb of the martyr, as we have had revealed unto us, the
Divine glory is revealed in miracles, and by Him are Divine
manifestations made where his remains are deposited, for whose
name he so valiantly struggled. We bid your Holiness, and
your brotherhood, farewell in the Lord."

The Letter of William, archbishop of Sens, to pope Alexander,
on the death of the blessed Thomas.

" To his most holy father and lord, Alexander, by the grace

church of Sens, health and due obedience with all duteous-
ness. To your Apostleship, holy father, all power lias been
granted in heaven and upon earth. In your hand is a two-edged
sword ; over nations and over kingdoms are you appointed, to
bind their kings in fetters, and their nobles in chains of iron.
Behold therefore, my lord, and consider what vintage they
have gathered in. For a wild boar from the wood has de-

your presence is pouring forth tears that drop blood, and
sprinkled with bitterness, because she has been set up as
a mark for the arrow, and has been made a reproach unto
her neighbours. And those who behold her, wag their
heads at her and say, where is their God ? But she weeping
and turning back, is crying aloud in the ears of the Lord
of Hosts, ' Avenge, Lord, the blood of thy servant and
martyr, the archbishop of Canterbury, who has been slain,
nay, crucified, for the liberties of the Church ! Holy father ! a
thing horrible to be mentioned, a disgraceful crime, an enormous
piece of flagitiousness has been perpetrated in your days ; a
thing at which both the ears shall tingle of each that shall hear
of it, the like of which has not been heard in Theman, 2 and has
not been seen in Canaan. For another Herod, of the seed of
Canaan and not of Judah, the offspring of vipers, sending his
lictors from his side, has not been struck with horror at scar-
ring with deep wounds the sign of the passion of our Lord,
which he carried on his head, and at disfiguring with shame-
ful marks the heavenly likeness. By reason whereof, as all
the Church affirms, the cause and the penalty equally make him
to be a martyr. The penalty is our grief, for the sufferings in-
flicted on him : the cause was the rigour of the ecclesiastical
censure, because he contended for the law of his God even,
unto the death. It is therefore your part, most merciful
father, keeper of the walls of Jerusalem, to apply a remedy to
what is past, and to employ foresight for the future. For
what place is there that can be safe, if the rage of a tyrant is
to stain with blood the Holy of Holies? And is it with
impunity to tear in pieces the vicegerents of Christ, the foster-
children of. the Church ? Let then the ecclesiastical laws
arousef-themselves, let ecclesiastical rights put on their ar-
mour. Let the vengeance for the blood of this glorious mar-
tyr, which cries aloud from England, enter into your presence.
For cry aloud it will, and will arouse not only the earth but
the heavens as well. And so consult for healing our sorrows,
that you consult both for your own good name and the liber-
ties of the Church. As to the rest, we have thought proper to
inform the fatherly affection of your Holiness, that whereas you
gave it as your command both to the lord archbishop of Rouen
and to ourselves, that we should place under an interdict the

lands that belong to the king of England on this side the sea, if
he should not keep the peace which he had promised to our
lord of Canterbury of glorious memory ; adding also, that if
either of us should be unable or unwilling to take part in
carrying out the same, the other should nevertheless obey
your commands ; the above-named archbishop of Rouen, after
we had caused your letter to be presented to him, signified
to us that he would come to the city of Sens, and would
act according to the tenor of your mandate. But when
he had come thither, together with the bishops of Lisieux,
Evreux, and Worcester, and very many others, both clergy
as well as laymen, of the household of the above-named king,
after many shiftings and excuses on his part, he made an-
swer, that he was on his road to your presence, and felt un-
willing to pour forth too bitter a censure upon the above-
named king. But we being sensible that whoever despises
obedience to the Apostolic mandates, incurs the guilt of pagan-
ism, according to the tenor of your mandate, with the common
advice of our brethren, all the bishops, and of the abbats of
Saint Denis, Saint Germain de Pres, Pontigny, Vaucouleurs, 3
Le Mans, and several other religious and wise men, have
pronounced sentence against his lands on this side the sea, and
have in your name enjoined the said archbishop and bishops
to cause the same to be observed. For we know that he has
neither, as he had promised, restored his possessions, nor had
established security for him, as his death gives proof. Through
a native of the diocese of Canterbury, whom we sent to him,
he has also signified unto us that he had given cause for his
death, and that he had had him slain. For this reason,
we do supplicate your clemency, that you will ratify the
sentence before-mentioned, and, as befits your majesty, and is
expedient for the safety of the Church, will cause it to be in
Buchwise observed, that the honor of God and your own will
may be preserved. And as for ourselves, who embrace your
Holiness with that duteousness of which you are so well
aware, we will by no means by reason hereof allow ourselves
to be contemned. We wish you farewell, and as befits your
majesty and holiness, so do."

TJte Letter of Theobald, earl of Slots, to pope Alexander, on ike
death of the blessed Thomas.

" To his most reverend lord and father, Alexander, by the
grace of God, Supreme Pontiff, Theobald, earl of Blois, and
procurator of the kingdom of France, health and due obe-
dience with filial subjection. It pleased your majesty, that
between the lord archbishop of Canterbury and the king of
England, peace should be restored, and renewed concord esta-
blished. Wherefore, according to the tenor of your mandate,
the king of England received him with a cheerful countenance,
and with features that bespoke joyousness, and made promises
to him of peace and restoration to favour. At this agreement
and reconciliation I was present, and in my presence the lord
archbishop of Canterbury complained to the king of the coro-
nation of his son, whom with premature aspirations and ar-
dent desire, he had caused to be promoted to the elevation of
the royal dignity. The king of England, being guilty of this
wrong, and being conscious of his guilt, gave to the archbishop
of Canterbury a pledge confirmatory of his right, and promising
that he would make satisfaction. The archbishop also made
complaint of those bishops who, contrary to the right and the
honor of the church of Canterbury, had presumed to intrude a
new Icing upon the seat of royalty ; not through zeal for jus-
tice, not that they might please God, but that they might
propitiate a tyrant. With regard to these, the king granted
him free licence and authority to pronounce sentence against
them according as might seem fit and proper to you and to him-
self. These things, in fact, I am prepared to attest, and to sub-
stantiate to you either upon oath, or in any other way you may
think fit. Upon this, a reconciliation having been made, the
man of God fearing nothing, returned, that he might submit
his throat to the sword, and expose his neck to the smiter ; and
on the day after the day of the Holy Innocents, this innocent
lamb suffered martyrdom ; his righteous blood was shed in
the place where the viaticum of our salvation, the blood of
Christ, was wont to be sacrificed. Those dogs of the court,
the people of the king's household and his domestics, showed
themselves true servants of the king, and guiltily shed in-
nocent blood. The detestable circumstances of this mon-
strous crime I would give you in detail, but I fear, lest it

might be ascribed to me as being done through hatred, and the
bearers of these presents will recount it more at large, and with
greater precision ; from their relation you will learn how great
an accumulation of grief, how vast a calamity has befallen
the universal Church, and the martyr of Canterbury. This
calamity, with due regard to her honor, the mother Church
of Eome cannot conceal from herself. For whatever is
dared to be done against an only daughter, the same extends
to her parent as well, nor without injury to the mother is
the daughter made captive. TJnto you, therefore, does the
blood of the righteous man cry aloud, demanding vengeance.
May then, holy father, the Almighty Father aid and counsel
you, who gave the blood of His Son to the world, that He
might wipe away the guilt of the world, and cleanse the spots
of our sins. May He both instil into you a wish for ven-
geance, and the power of obtaining it, that so the Church, put
to confusion by the magnitude of this unheard-of crime, may
have reason to rejoice at the condign punishment thereof."

The Letter of William, archbishop of Sens, to our lord the pope,
against the king of England, in relation to the death of the
blessed Thomas.

" To his most loving father and lord, Alexander, by the grace
of God Supreme Pontiff, William, the humble servant of the
church of Sens, the spirit of counsel and fortitude, with all
service of due obedience. While writing these lines, or rather
before I had begun to write them, I stopped short and hesi-
tated, being greatly in doubt in what kind of language I
could present to the eyes of your clemency the atrocity of the
crime lately perpetrated, and the enormity of the offence so
lecently committed. And, indeed, I believe that the outcry
of the world must have already filled the ears of your Holiness,
who have your seat upon the watch-tower of the world,
how that this, not king of the English, but enemy rather of the
English and of the whole body of Christ, has lately committed
wickedness against the holy one, the son of your right hand,
whom you had confirmed unto yourself. His departure from
this world, and the mode of his departure, even though perchance
you may have heard from the diverse or adverse relation of
any persons, I will faithfully and conscientiously relate what
has been signified unto me by those who were present, and, in

a few words, explain the circumstances of the perpetration of
this crime, the enormity of which can hardly he ima-
gined. During the Nativity of our Lord, on the day after
the Feast of the Innocents, towards sunset, and about the
hour of vespers, the executioners having gained admission,
the three, namely, who had been the first to arrive, approached
this valiant champion of Christ in a most threatening and in-
solent manner ; the names of whom, that their memories may
be visited with everlasting maledictions, I here insert, Hugh
de Morville, William de Tracy, and Reginald Fitz-TIrse ;
these, on their first approach, on being saluted by the man of
God, did not return the salutation, inasmuch as, having
entered upon the ways of perdition, they manifestly rejected
all that was salutary ; but, on the contrary, contumeliously
and malignantly thundered forth threats against him, if he
did not, in obedience to the king's mandate, absolve the
bishops who were suspended or excommunicated. On his
making answer that this manifestly pertained to your province,
as being the sole judge thereon, and that he could not think of
claiming any himself where so great an authority was con-
cerned ; they immediately, on the king's behalf, denounced
him as a traitor, and instantly went forth to their company
of soldiers. As they went forth they also ordered, in the
king's name, those knights who belonged to the household
of the man of God, upon peril of their lives and forfeiture
of ail their honors, to go forth likewise, and silently and
patiently await the result, A similar proclamation of the
king was published throughout the city. But this single
champion of Christ has, in our days, despised the threats of
princes, and was with the greatest difficulty, by the persuasion
of the knights, compelled to go forth from the place where he
had already, as it were, received a foretaste of death : and this
was done that he might not seem unwilling to meet his end.
God, therefore, providing the mother church, dedicated in
honor of Christ himself, entering the same, the anointed of
the Lord was deemed worthy to be sacrificed for the name of
Christ in the spot where each day Christ as well is offered up.
This priest of the Most High, standing before the altar, and
embracing in his arms the cross which he had been accustomed to
have carried before him. and praying, voluntarily offered himself
as a peace-offering to God between the cross and the horns of the

altar. For the hour of his passion was drawing nigh ; on
bended knees, with throat extended, and neck bowed down,
he received the cup of salvation, and was beheaded by the
three executioners above-named, having been first reviled
with insults and many reproaches, that in no way he might
be defrauded of the example which he had before him in the
passion of his Lord. And that, still more, the form thereof
might find a remarkable resemblance in his case, at the same
hour he prayed for his murderers, adding thereto, and earnestly
entreating, that his household might be kept unhurt by the pre-
sent evils. Therefore, alone, and not without the shedding of
blood, did the priest enter into the Holy place. And inasmuch
as, since the death of the holy man we have heard, from the
frequent relation of many persons, that certain wonderful
things, by the working of the Lord, have taken place, they
ought not to be entirely omitted. For, it is said, and is stead-
fastly affirmed, that, after his passion, he appeared in a vision
to many, whom he informed that he was not dead, but living,
and showed them, not wounds, but only the scars of wounds.
Among these, he is said distinctly to have appeared to a cer-
tain aged monk, named Neil, but in what way I will not
descant upon, in order that too long a narrative may be
avoided ; but the bearers thereof will faithfully and at large
relate the circumstances. The story, too, about the blind
man, who, immediately on his passion being ended, rubbed his
eyes with the still warm blood and received his eyes and his
sight, has been heard by all. There is also a story related by
many, not unworthy of credit, relative to the tapers that were
placed around his body, which, on being put out, after-
wards were lighted again of themselves. And, a thing still
more pleasing and miraculous, after all the obsequies of mor-
tality had been performed around his body, while he was lying
upon the bier in the choir, about dawn, raising his left hand,
he gave the benediction. Arouse yourself, then, man of God, and
put on the valour of those whose seat you hold ; on the one hand
let pity, on the other let indignation, move you to smite the
smiter of your son ; the one you owe to your son, the other
to the tyrant : and so increase the glory upon earth of him whom
God thus wondrously glorifies in heaven. But, to the other,
award ignominy; who upon earth has so dreadfully persecuted
God, and has smitten the sides of your own body, has torn

forth your entrails therefrom, and has trodden them under foot
on the earth ; who has also, by the hands of I know not what
uncircumcised and unclean wretches, so perfidiously, so in-
humanly, slaughtered your son, whom alone you loved as
though a mother; neither fearing to commit violence upon the
father, nor taking compassion upon his age. Wherefore, those
to whose ministry you have succeeded, to their zeal succeed
as well. And, inasmuch as you see the wickedness of Ahab,
let emulation of Elias move you. Ahab slew [Naboth]
and took possession ; but, if we carefully weigh all the cir-
cumstances of the crime perpetrated by Ahab, Ahab is justi-
fied before this man. For this crime is one that by far
deserves the first place among all the crimes of the wicked
that are read of or related ; as, all the wickedness of Nero,
the perfidiousness of Julian, and even the sacrilegious treachery
of Judas does it exceed. For look at this, and consider what
a personage, in what a church, what a time, too, for per-
petrating the crime did he made choice of; namely, the
Nativity of our Lord, the day after the feast of the Holy
Innocents ; so that, since the old one, in our days a new Herod
has risen up. The protection, too, that was publicly granted
to him failed to recall the traitor from the commission of
this wickedness. As though, too, of himself he was not
sufficiently mad, he has had encouragers, who have given
horns to a sinner, those false brethren, men to be detested
by all churches throughout the world, namely, that devil
Roger, the archbishop of York, Gilbert, bishop of London, and
Jocelyn, bishop of Salisbury, not bishops but apostates ; 4 who
have not secretly sold your son, their brother, but, in truth,
have slain him, fearing neither the curse of the aged father,
nor having regard for his sorrows or his age. That their
life, both now and always henceforth, may be passed in
bitterness, and their memory may be visited with eternal
maledictions, may, Holy Father, your authority and your
severity equally effect. Holy Father, we bid your Holiness
farewell."

In the meantime, Hotrod, archbishop of Eouen, Gilles,
bishop of Evreux, and Roger, bishop of Worcester, with
Richard Barre, and some others of the clerks and household
of the king of England, set out to wait upon the Roman Pon-

tiff, in behalf of the king of England and his kingdom. But
the lord archbishop of Rouen, being worn out with infirmi-
ties and old age, after having accomplished nearly half the
journey, was able to proceed no further, but returned to Nor-
mandy to his see, and the above-named bishops, with the
king's clerks, proceeded on their journey. On arriving, they
obtained with the greatest difficulty of the Supreme Pontiff
that two cardinals, Theodinus and Albert, should come on
behalf of our lord the pope to Normandy, in order to take cog-
nizance of the dispute which existed between the king and
the church of Canterbury, of the death of the martyr of
Canterbury, and of other ecclesiastical dignities, and to give
judgment thereon, according as God should suggest to them.
On this, the persons who had gone to Rome wrote to our lord
the king to this effect :

" To their most dearly beloved lord, Henry, the illustrious
king of England, duke of Normandy and Aquitaine, and earl
of Anjou, Robert, abbat of Yaucouleurs,* the archdeacon of
Salisbury, Robert, archdeacon of Lisieux, Richard Barre, and
master Henry, health and fealty in all things, and in all places
obedience. Be it known unto your majesty, that Richard
Barre went before us, and, amid great danger and hardships,
preceded us to the court of our lord the pope. "We four,
with the two bishops, the dean of Evreux, and master
Henry, with great difficulty arrived at Sienna, where we were
detained for some days, as the earl Macharius had closed the roads
on every side, so that there were no means of egress for any
one. As we four, together with the bishops, who greatly
desired to proceed, were unable so to do, being beset with the
greatest difficulty of judging how to act, by the common consent
of all, we sallied forth secretly at midnight ; and thus, over the
ridges of mountains, and through places almost inaccessible,
with great fear and peril, we at last arrived at Tusculanum. 6
Here we found Richard Barre, anxious, as he expressed himself,
to sustain your honor, and skilfully, usefully, and unceas-
ingly striving for the promotion of your interests, but, neverthe-
less, in great trouble and sorrow, because our lord the pope
had not received him, and other persons had not shewn them-
selves affable and hospitable towards him. As for ourselves, on

ever, possible that Valency is the place meant. 6 Now Frascati.

our arrival, our lord the pope would neither see us, nor
admit us to the kiss, nor at his foot. Indeed, most of the
cardinals hardly deigned to give us a reception even with a
word. In consequence of this, being long racked with anxious
cares, in the bitterness of our spirit, we entreated those who
were more faithfully attached to you, by every possible
means, that, through their intervention, our lord the pope
might in some way or other grant us the indulgence of an
audience. At length, at their urgent request, the lord abbat
of Vaucouleurs and Robert, archdeacon of Lisieux, who were
not so strongly suspected, obtained a reception. But when they,
on giving the salutation on your behalf, made mention of your
name as being a most devoted son of the Church of Rome, the
whole court cried aloud with one voice, "Forbear! forbear!"
as though it were abominable to our lord the pope to hear men-
tion made of your name. Upon this, they left the court, and
returned at a later hour to our lord the pope, and gave him
information as to the object of our mission, and what injunc-
tions we had received from your majesty. They also related,
in their order, each of the benefits you had conferred on the
archbishop of Canterbury, and all the excesses and affronts
he had been guilty of against your dignity. The whole of
these matters were at first privately mentioned to him, and,
afterwards, in the presence of our lord the pope and all the
cardinals, they being confronted by two clerks of Canterbury,
Alexander, and Gunther of Flanders. The fifth day of the week
before Easter now drawing nigh, on which, according to usage
of the Roman Church, our lord the pope is wont publicly to ab-
solve or publicly to excommunicate, feeling certain that as to
what regarded your grievances and those of your kingdom they
had hitherto managed matters with the greatest foresight, 6 * we
consulted those whom we knew to be faithful to your majesty;
namely, the lord of Portuenza, the lord Jacinto, the lord of Pavia,
the lord of Tusculanum, the lord Peter de Mirio (the lord John
of Naples being absent), and begged them with the most urgent
prayers and entreaties, that they would disclose to us the in-
tentions of our lord the pope towards us, and what determina-
tion he purposed to form on our case. However, the information
they gave us in answer was nothing but what was ill-boding and

6 * It is pretty clear that " prom diutissime " is a misprint for " provi-

disgraceful to your highness; and we learned from their rela-
tion and that of brother Francis, a trustworthy man, inter-
rupted as it was by sobs, that, by the common advice of his
brethren, our lord the pope had immutably determined on
that day to pronounce sentence of interdict upon you by
name, and upon all your dominions on both sides of the sea,
and to confirm the sentence that had been pronounced against
the bishops. Being, consequently, placed in a position of the
greatest difficulty, we made the most stringent efforts, both
through the cardinals and through those of our companions
who had access to him, and through the people of his household,
to induce him to pause in this design, or at least defer it
until the arrival of your bishops. When this could not by
any means be effected, we, as became us, and as we are bound
in duty to you, being neither able nor bound to put up with
disgrace to your own person and calamity to the whole of your
dominions, having convened all our companions before certain
of the cardinals, at length discovered a way for the preservation
of your safety and honor, safe, and becoming, and advantageous
to the whole of your dominions, as well as necessary for the
bishops. 7 Hereby we averted from you, and from your do-
minions, and from your bishops, the disgrace and peril that
were impending, and exposed ourselves for obtaining this
liberation to the whole of the danger, believing and having
an assured hope that the whole matter will proceed according
to what we believe to be your wishes, and according to what
we feel assured ought to be your wishes. The lords bishop
of Worcester and of Evreux, together with Robert, dean of
Evreux, and master Henry, were shortly about to follow, and,
indeed, we left them behind, anxious and vexed beyond mea-
sure because they had not been able to come on according to
nieir wishes, for the purpose of carrying out the business you
had entrusted them with. 7 * However, it was their suggestion, as
much as our own, that we should by some means or other
precede them, in order to be enabled to prevent the dis-
grace and mischiefs which our adversaries were preparing

7 Bribery is probably the method thus covertly alluded to.

7 * There must be some mistake in this, as master Henry is one of the
five by whom the letter is addressed. It appears, however, from the com-
mencement, probable that master Henry was left behind at Sienna, and
that he really did not take part in the letter.

for us ; for we were assured that serious troubles were in pre-
paration for you at the court, and were in dread of the
usual custom of that day. With wishes for your lasting pros-
perity, we bid your highness farewell : be comforted in the
Lord, and let your heart rejoice, inasmuch as, to your glory, the
present clouds will be succeeded by serenity. On the Satur-
day before Palm Sunday we arrived at the court, and the
bearer of these presents has left us on Easter Day."

In the meantime, there came into Normandy two cardinals,
Gratianus and Vivianus, sent as legates a latere by Alexander,
the Supreme Pontiff, who vexed the king of England by many
and various annoyances, and wished to place him and his do-
minions under interdict. But the king of England being
warned of this beforehand, had, before their arrival, appealed
to the presence of our lord the Supreme Pontiff, and by these
means kept himself and his dominions unhurt by the exercise
of their severity.

Still, fearing the power of the Apostolic See, he hastened
to the sea-shore, and crossed over from Normandy to Eng-
land, giving orders that no person who should bring a brief, of
whatever rank or order he might be, should be allowed to cross
over, either from Normandy to England or from England to
Normandy, unless he should first give security that he would
seek to inflict neither evil nor injury upon the king or his
kingdom.

After this, the said king, collecting together a great fleet of
ships, caused them to be laden with provisions and arms, and
ordered them to meet at Milford Haven, which is near Pembroke.
In the meantime, he also collected a large army of horse and
foot, and came to Pembroke, in order to meet his fleet. These
being assembled and everything duly arranged, he embarked,
with his army, on board the fleet at Milford Haven, on Satur-
day, the seventeenth day before the calends of November, and
on the next day, with joy, effected a successful landing in
Ireland, at a place which is called Croch, 8 distant eight
miles from the city of Waterford, at the ninth hour of the
day ; having crossed over with four hundred large ships, laden
with warriors, horses, arms, and provisions. At the moment
when he disembarked, a white hare sprang forth from a thicket,
which was immediately captured and presented to him as an
omen of victory.

A. P. 1172. ACCOTWT OP THE IRISH BISHOPS. 351

On the day after the arrival of the king of England in Ire-
land, that is to say, on the fifteenth day before the calends of
November, being the second day of the week and the feast of
Saint Luke the Evangelist, he and the whole of his troops
moved on to "Waterford, an episcopal city. Here he found
William Fitz-Aldelm, his seneschal, and Robert Fitz-Bernard,
with some other persons of his household, whom he had sent
before him from England. Here he also stayed for a period of
fifteen days, and there came to him, at his command, the king
of Cork, the king of Limerick, the king of Ossory, the king
of Meath, Reginald de Waterford, and nearly all the prin-
cipal men of Ireland, with the exception of the king of Con-
naught, who said that he was the rightful lord of the whole of
Ireland. In addition to these, there came to the king of Eng-
land, while staying here, all the archbishops, bishops, and
abbats of the whole of Ireland, and acknowledged him as king
and lord of Ireland, taking the oath of fealty to him and his
heirs, and admitting his and their right of reigning over them
for all time to come ; after which, they gave their charters
to the same effect. After the example of the clergy, the
above-named kings and principal men of Ireland received
Henry, the king of England, in a similar manner, as lord and
king of Ireland, and did homage to him, and swore fealty to
him and his heirs against all men.

It deserves to be known that, in Ireland, there are four arch-
bishops and twenty-eight bishops, the names of whom, at
this period, were as follows : Gelasius was archbishop of
Armagh, and primate of the whole of Ireland; under him he had
eight suifragan bishops, whose names were as follow : Odan,
bishop, 9 Maurice, bishop of Clogher, Malethias, bishop of Down,
Nehemias, bishop of Deny, Gilbert, bishop of Raphoe, Thad-
dqiis, bishop of Connor, Christian, bishop of Ardagh, and
Eleutherius, bishop of Clonmacnoise. Donatus, archbishop of
Cashel, had under him ten suffragan bishops, whose names were
as follow : Christian, bishop of Lismore, legate of the Apostolic
See, the bishop of Emly, the bishop of Cloyne, the bishop of
Ardmore, the bishop of Limerick, 10 the bishop of Kildare, the

9 Probably bishop of Meath : but it is not stated in the text. Nearly
all these names are mis-spelt, and it is next to impossible to tracfi some of
them. They are in a state of almost hopeless confusion.

10 This prelate is probably meant under the title " LucapniarensU
episcopus."

bishop of Waterford, the bishop of Ardfert, the bishop of Ross,
and the bishop of Kilfenora. Laurentius, archbishop of Dub-
lin, had under him five suffragan bishops, whose names were
as follow : the bishop of Bistagh, the bishop of Ferns, the
bishop of Leighlin, the bishop of Kindare, and the bishop of
Ossory. 11 The fourth, being the archbishop of Tuam, had
under him five suffragan bishops, whose names were as fol-
low : the bishop of Kinferns, the bishop of Killala, the
bishop of Moy, the bishop of Elphin, and the bishop of
Aghadoe.

All the above, both archbishops as well as bishops, acknow-
ledged Henry, king of England, and his heirs, as their kings
and lords for ever ; which they also confirmed by charter under
their hands and seals. After this, the king of England sent
Nicholas, his chaplain, and Ralph, archdeacon of Llandaff, his
clerk, together with the archbishops and bishops of Ireland,
to the city of Cashel, to hold a synod there, upon the ordinances
of the Church.

At this synod it was ordained that children should be
brought to the church, and there baptized in clean water,
being thrice dipped therein, in the name of the Father, and of
the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. And this was to be done
by the hands of the priests, except in cases where fear of
death prevented it, when it might be done by another person,
and in any other place, on such occasion it being allowable to
be done by any person, without regard to sex or order. It
was also ordained that tithes should be paid to churches out of
all possessions : and that all laymen who should think proper
to have wives, should have them in conformity with the laws of
the Church. The king of England also sent a copy of the
charters of the whole of the archbishops and bishops of Ire-
land to pope Alexander ; who, by the Apostolic authority,
confirmed to him and his heirs the kingdom of Ireland, ac-
cording to the tenor of the charters of archbishops and bishops
of Ireland.

These things being thus completed at Waterford, the king
of England proceeded thence to Dublin, and remained there
from the feast of Saint Martin until the beginning of Lent ;
and here he ordered to be built, near the church of Saint
Andrew the Apostle, without the city of Dublin, a royal

palace for his own use, constructed, with wonderful skill, of
peeled osiers, according to the custom of that country. Here
with the kings and principal men of Ireland, he held the usual
festivities on the day of the Nativity of our Lord.

In the meantime, Gilbert, bishop of London, and Jocelyn,
bishop of Salisbury, sent to Rome and received letters of ab-
solution, the tenor of which was as follows :

The Letter of Pope Alexander to the Archbishop of Bourges.

" Alexander the bishop, servant of the servants of God,
to his venerable brethren, the archbishop of Bourges and the
bishop of Nivernois, health, and the Apostolic benediction.
We believe that it is not unknown to your brotherhood
how Thomas of blessed memory, formerly archbishop of
Canterbury, in obedience to our mandate, pronounced sentence
of excommunication upon the bishops of London and Salis-
bury : which we took due care to have ratified and confirmed
by the authority of the Apostolic See. Now, inasmuch as
the aforesaid bishops, being worn out with old age and infir-
mity of body, and, one of them labouring under a malady, are
not able to come to our presence : to you, in whose prudence
and fidelity we have full confidence, we have thought proper
to entrust their absolution, for which, envoys from Henry,
the king of England, and the said bishops have made the most
urgent application. Therefore, we do command your brother-
hood, by these Apostolic writings, within one month from the
time when the said messengers shall have returned home (as
to the approach of the legates whom we have thought proper
to send into those parts to take cognizance of this atrocious
crime and misdeed which has been perpetrated and of the for-
giveness of the king, that they have passed the Alps you
*e not unaware), that, after having publicly received their
oaths according to the custom of the Church, that they are
ready to pay obedience to our mandate, you will absolve them
from the ban of excommunication by pronouncing sentence
of suspension for the same cause for which they were recently
sentenced to excommunication, the said cause being still
valid and of full effect. But if you shall be satisfied that
the bishop of Salisbury, from labouring under the effects
of disease, cannot come to you, then it is our pleasure that
you shall attend upon him personally. Or if you shall be



354 ANNALS OF ROGER DE HOVEDEff. A.D. 1172.

unable to attend upon him, then you are to send proper persons,
in whom both you and we ourselves may be able to place full
reliance, who, having publicly received his oath, in the pre-
sence of the church, that he is ready to pay obedience to our
mandates, may thereupon absolve him. But if, brother arch-
bishop, it shall not be in your power to give attention to this
matter, then do you, brother bishop, together with the abbat of
Pontigny, give your most diligent attention to the injunctions
which we have given. Given at Tusculanum, on the eighth day
before the calends of May."

In the same year, Avigouth El Emir Amimoli, the emperor of
the Africans, crossed the African sea and landed in Spain with
a strong hand and an outstretched arm, and, king Lupus,
who was a pagan, being dead, took possession of his lands ;
namely, Murcia and Valentia, and many other cities ; and
then, by the advice of Ferdinand, king of Saint Jago, entered
the lands of Alphonso, king of Castille, and took by storm the
cities of Cuenca and Octa, is and slaughtered all the Christians
whom he captured therein, with the exception of a few, whom
he doomed to perpetual slavery.

In the year of grace 1 1 72, being the eighteenth year of the
reign of king Henry the Second, the said king was at Dublin,
in Ireland, on the day of the Nativity of our Lord, which took
place on Saturday, and there he gave a royal feast. Having
stayed there until the beginning of Lent, he proceeded thence to
the city of Wcxford, where he remained until Easter. While
he was staying there, Theodinus and Albert, the cardinals who
were sent as legates a latere by the Supreme Pontiif, came into
Normandy. On their arrival being known, the king hastened
to meet them ; but, before he left Ireland, he gave, and by
his charter confirmed, to Hugh de Lacy the whole of the
lands of Meath, with all their appurtenances, to hold in fee and
hereditarily of himself and his heirs, by a hundred knights'
service ; and gave in his charge the city of Dublin, and
appointed him justiciary of Ireland. He also gave in charge
to Robert Fitz-Bernard the city of Waterford and the city of
Wexford, with their appurtenances, and ordered castles to be
built therein.

The festival of Easter approaching, the king's household

matter of dispute what is the present name of the place so called.



A.D. 1172. THE PTTBGATION OF KING HENET. 355

crossed over from Ireland to England, on Easter Day, and
landed at Milford Haven, near Pembroke. The king, how-
ever, by reason of the solemnity of the day, was unwilling to
embark, but embarked the day after, and landed in "Wales,
near Saint David's. After this, the king repaired with all haste
to Portsmouth, and, taking with him his son Henry, passed
over from England to Normandy, and found the above-named
cardinals at Caen, and, by their advice, made peace with
Louis, king of the Franks, as to the coronation of his daugh-
ter; and accordingly, with the consent and advice of the
above-named cardinals, sent back the king, his son, to Eng-
land, and with him Hotrod, archbishop of Rouen, Gilles,
bishop of Evreux, and Roger, bishop of Worcester, for the
purpose of crowning him and Margaret, his wife, the daugh-
ter of Louis, king of France : on which, they crowned them
in the church of Saint Swithin, at Winchester, on the
sixth day before the calends of September, being the Lord's
Day. Immediately after the coronation had taken place, his
son, the king, with the queen, his wife, and the archbishop
of Rouen, and the bishops of Evreux and Worcester, crossed
over from England to Normandy.

The Purgation of King Henry for the death of the blessed Thomas.

Henry, the king of England, the father, king Henry,
his son, Rotrod, archbishop of Rouen, and all the bishops
and abbats of Normandy, met at the city of Avranches, in
presence of the cardinals, Theodinus and Albert. In their
presence, the king of England, the father, on the fifth day
before the calends of October, being the fourth day of the
week, and the feast of Saints Cosmus and Damianus, the
Martyrs, proved his innocence in the church of Saint
Andrew the Apostle, by oath, in the presence of the above-
named cardinals, and of all the clergy and the people, upon
the relics of the Saints, and upon the Holy Gospels, and that
he had neither commanded nor wished that the archbishop of
Canterbury should be put to death, and that, when he heard
thereof, he was greatly concerned. But, inasmuch as he
could not apprehend u those malefactors who slew Thomas,

14 Roger of Wendover, however, says that they remained in the king's
castle, at Knaresborough, for a whole year after the murder of the arch-
bishop.

archbishop of Canterbury, of blessed memory, and he feared
that they had perpetrated that profane deed in consequence of
his agitated state of mind and the perturbation in which they
had seen him, he made oath that he would give satisfaction in
the following manner :

In the first place, he made oath that he would not with-
draw from Alexander, the Supreme Pontiff, and his Catholic
successors, so long as they should repute him to be a Catholic
king.

He also made oath that he would neither prevent appeals nor
allow them to be prevented, but that they should be freely made
in his kingdom to the Roman Pontiff in causes ecclesiastical ;
yet so, that if any parties shoiild be suspected by him, they
should give him security that they would not seek the injury
of him or of his kingdom.

He also made oath that, for a period of three years from
the Nativity of our Lord then next ensuing he would assume
the cross, and would in the following summer go in person to
Jerusalem, unless he should remain at home by permission of
Alexander, the Supreme Pontiff, or of his Catholic succes-
sors : provided, that if in the meantime, by reason of urgent
necessity, he should set out for Spain to war against the Sara-
cens, then for so long a period as he should be engaged in that
expedition he might defer setting out for Jerusalem

Besides this, he made oath that in the meantime he would
give to the Templars as much money as in the opinion of the
brethren of the Temple would suffice for the maintenance of
two hundred knights, for the defence of the land of Jerusalem,
during a period of one year.

Besides this, he remitted his wrath and displeasure against
all those, both clergy and laity, who were in exile for the cause
of Saint Thomas, and allowed them freely and peacefully
to return home.

He also made oath that the possessions of the church of
Canterbury, if any had been taken away, he would restore in
full, in the same state in which they were one year before
the blessed Thomas, archbishop of Canterbury, had departed
from England.

He also made oath that he would utterly abolish the customs
which had been introduced in his time to the prejudice of the
churches of his kingdom.









A.D. 1172. THE CHARTEB OF ABSOLUTION OF THE KING. 357

All these articles he made oath that he would observe faith-
fully and without evil-intent. He also made his son,king Henry,
swear to observe these articles, those excepted which only re-
lated personally to himself. And, to the intent that the same
might be retained in the memory of the Eoman Church, the
king, the father, caused his seal to be set to the writing in
which the above-stated articles were contained, together with
the seals of the above-named cardinals.

The Charter of Absolution of our lord the King.

"To Henry, by the grace of God, the illustrious king of the
English, Albert titular of Saint Laurentius in Lucinia, and
Theodinus, titular of Saint Vitalis, cardinal priests, legates of
the Apostolic See, health in Him who giveth health unto
kings. That the things which take place may not come to be
matter of doubt, both custom suggests and the ordinary re-
quirements of utility demand that the same should be regularly
stated at length in writing. For this reason it is that we have
thought proper to have committed to writing those injunctions
which we have given you, because you entertain a fear that
those malefactors who slew Thomas of blessed memory, the late
archbishop of Canterbury, proceeded to the commission of that
crime in consequence of your agitated state of mind and the
perturbation in which they saw you to be. As to which deed,
however, you have of your own free-will exculpated yourself in
our presence, to the effect that you neither gave command nor
wished that he should be put to death ; and that, when news
reached you of the same, you were greatly concerned thereat.
From the ensuing feast of Pentecost, for the period of one
year, you shall give as much money as in the opinion of the
brethren of the Temple will suffice to maintain two hundred
* knights for the defence of the land of Jerusalem during a
period of one year. Also, from the Nativity of our Lord
next ensuing, for a period of three years, you shall assume
the cross, and shall in the ensuing summer in person set
out for Jerusalem, unless you shall remain at home by the
permission of our lord the pope, or of his Catholic successors ;
provided that if, by reason of urgent necessity, you shall set
out for Spain to war against the Saracens, so long a period as
shall elapse from the time of your setting out you shall be
enabled to defer setting out for Jerusalem. You shall not

prevent appeals, nor allow them to be prevented ; but they
shall freely be made to the Roman Pontiff, in causes eccle-
siastical, in good faith, and without fraud and evil-intent,
in order that causes may be considered by the Eoman Pontiff,
and be brought to a conclusion by him ; yet so, that if any
parties shall be suspected by you, they shall give you security
that they will not seek the injury of you or of your kingdom.
The customs which have been introduced in your time, to the
prejudice of the churches of your kingdom, you shall utterly
abolish. The possessions of the church of Canterbury, if any
have been taken away, you shall restore in full, in the same
state in which they were one year before the archbishop de-
parted from England. Moreover, to the clerks and to the laity of
either sex, you shall restore your protection and favor and their
possessions, who, by reason of the before-named archbishop,
have been deprived thereof. These things, by the authority of
our lord the pope, we do, for the remission of your sins, enjoin
and command you to observe, without fraud and evil-intent.
Wherefore, to the above effect, in the presence of a multitude of
persons, you have, as you venerate the Divine Majesty, made
oath. Tour son, also, has made oath to the same effect, with
the exception only of that which in especial related personally
to yourself. You have also both made oath that you will not
withdraw from our lord the pope, Alexander, and his Catholic
successors, so long as they shall repute you, like your prede-
cessors, to be Catholic kings. And further, that this may
be firmly retained in the memory of the Roman Church, you
have ordered your seal to be set thereto."

The Letter of the same Cardinals to the archbishop of Ravenna.

" To their venerable and beloved brother in Christ, Gilbert,
by the grace of God, archbishop of Ravenna, Albert, by the
Divine condescension, titular of Saint Laurentius inLucinia, and
Theodinus, titular of Saint Vitalis, cardinal priests, legates of
the Apostolic See, that which God has promised that He will
grant unto the watchful. Inasmuch as we believe that you are
desirous to hear somewhat relative to our present state and the
progress of the business which was entrusted to our charge; we
have thought proper by this present writing to inform your bro-
therhood how God has dealt as towards ourselves and through
the ministry of our humble exertions. Know, therefore, that



A.D. 1172. LETTER OF THE CARDINALS. 359

after the illustrious king of England had learned as a truth that
we had arrived in his kingdom, laying aside every obstacle
that might retard him, and omitting the transaction of press-
ing business, he passed over from England into the Norman
territories, and instantly sent unto us many messengers of
honorable rank, enquiring of us in what place we would prefer
to meet and hold a conference with him. It at length pleased
us to meet for the purpose of holding a conference at the
monastery of Savigny, where we might be aided by the prayers
of religious men. We came thither, and thither also came
many persons of either order from out of his.kingdom to meet
us ; and we diligently treated, so far as we were able, upon what
related to his own salvation and the obedience enjoined by us.
As, however, we were unable to agree on all points, he with-
drew from us, as though about to cross over to England, and we
remained there with the intention of going the following day
to the city of Avranches. However, on the next day, there
came to us the bishop of Lisieux and two archdeacons, and
that being conceded which we demanded, we proceeded to the
city before-mentioned. At this place, on the Lord's Day, on
which is sung ' Vocem jocunditatis, 1 lb we went forth to meet a
considerable number of persons, as they did to meet us; and the
king then fulfilled the conditions that had been made, with
such extreme humility that, beyond a doubt, this maybe believed
to be the work of Him who looks down upon the earth and
maketh it to tremble. Still, how that he showed himself a
fearer of God and an obedient son of the Church, it is not
necessary, in the present brief narrative, to relate. For this
his actions sufficiently manifest, and will manifest still more
fully, according to the hopes that have been given us of the
future. In the first place, therefore, as to the death of
* Thomas, of blessed memory, the late archbishop of Canter-
bury : not in consequence of our exacting it, but of his own
free-will, touching the Holy Gospels, he purged his conscience,
making oath to the effect that he had neither commanded nor
wished that the said archbishop should be put to death ; and
that, when he heard thereof, he was greatly concerned. But
because what had been done he feared had been done through
his instrumentality, he made the following oath as to giving

13 " The voice of gladness :" the beginning of the introit for the fifth
Sundav aftei Easter.



360 ANNALS OF ROGER DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1172.

satisfaction for the same. In the first place, he made oath
that he will not withdraw from our lord the pope, Alexander,
and his Catholic successors, so long as they shall repute him
to be a Catholic king and a Christian. The same he also made
his eldest son swear in the charter of absolution for the death
of the blessed Thomas. He also promised on oath other things
very necessary for the clergy and for the people ; all of which
we have carefully and in their order as he swore them set forth
in the charter of his absolution. He also promised other things
of his own free-will to be carried out, which are not necessary
in their order to be committed to writing. We have written to
you to this effect, that you may know that he is obedient to
God, and much more disposed to be duteous to the Divine
will than heretofore he has been. In addition to this, you
must know that his son made oath to the same effect with him-
self in relation to the customs above-mentioned. Besides
this, he publicly announced that he would repeat again, at
Caen, all that had passed there, in presence of a greater assem-
blage of persons, in order that there might be left to no one any
room to doubt his sincerity. He has also released the bishops
from the promise which they made to him as to observing
the customs, and has promised that he will not exact this in
future."

On the following day, the above-named cardinals held a
great synod there, together with the archbishop, bishops, and
clergy of Normandy, and there they agreed to the decrees under-
written, and enjoined that they should be strictly and invio-
lably observed by all.

The Decrees published at Avranches by the cardinals Albert
and Theodinm.

" Youths are, under no circumstance, to be admitted to the
government of those churches, and the administration of those
offices, in which there is the cure of souls.

" Further, the sons of priests are not to be placed in the
churches of their fathers.

" Further, the laity are not to have a share of offerings made
in the church.

" Further, churches are not to be entrusted to the charge of
vicars hired by the year.

"Further, the priests of the larger churches, who have



A.D. 1172. DECREES PTH3LISHED AT AVRANCHES. 361

the means of so doing, are to be compelled to have another
minister under them.

"Further, priests are not to be ordained without having
a sure title.

" Further, churches are not to be let out at a yearly rent.

" Further, let the minister who performs the duties of the
church be deprived of no portion of one third part of the
tithes.

" Further, let those persons who hold tithes by hereditary
right be at liberty to give them to some fitting clerk, whom-
soever they may choose ; but upon this understanding, that,
after him, they are to revert to the church to which of right
they belong.

" Let no man while his wife is still living enter into mo-
nastic orders, and so, on the other hand, with regard to the
wife, unless they shall have both passed the time for satisfying
the lusts of the flesh.

"Further, at the Advent of our Lord, to all who shall be
able to obey, and especially to the clergy and the knighthood,
let fasting and abstinence from flesh be enjoined.

"Further, clerks are not to be appointed judges 16 to ad-
minister the jurisdiction of secular powers ; and those who
shall presume so to do, let them be expelled from their eccle-
siastical benefices."

But, as regards the new books relative to those excommu-
nicated, the property of the dead that the priests receive, the
benediction of brides, baptism, and the eight-and-forty pounds
which are demanded for the absolution of those excommu-
nicated, there was nothing settled, as the bishops of Nor-
mandy were unwilling to receive a decree on those subjects.
In the same synod, the archbishop of Tours claimed the
archbishopric of Dol, as properly belonging to his own arch-
bishopric, affirming that there ought not to be there an archi-
episcopal see ; but the clergy of Dol stoutly maintained the
contrary.

These matters having been thus arranged, about the time
of the feast of All Saints, the new king of England, by com-
mand of the king, his father, crossed over with his queen from
England to Normandy, though much against his will. When

16 The text has " clerici Judrei," " Jewish clerks." This is clearly an
error. The word is probably "judices," "judges."



362 ANNALS OF BOGER DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1173.

they had come to him, he immediately sent them to have an
interview with the king of France ; for the king of France
greatly longed to see his daughter and to converse with her.
When they came to him in France they were received by
him with great honor and joyousness, and stayed with him
some days.

From this circumstance great injury resulted to the king-
dom of England, and to the kingdom of France as well. For
Louis, king of France, who always held the king of England
in hatred, counselled the new king of England, as soon as he
should arrive in Normandy, to request the king, his father, to
give him either the whole of England or the whole of Nor-
mandy, where he himself might reside with his daughter. He
further advised him, if his father should be willing to grant
him neither of those countries, to return, together with his
queen, to France to him. In the meantime, the king, dread-
ing the deceit and malice of the king of France, which he had
frequently experienced, sent to France for his son and his wife ;
on which, having received permission from the king of France,
agreably to the king's command, they returned into Nor-
mandy.

The festival of the Nativity of our Lord now approaching,
the king proceeded towards Anjoii, and held his court there
on the day of the Nativity of our Lord, leaving his son behind,
together with his queen, in Normandy.

In the same year, Adam de Port was charged with being a
traitor to the king ; and, because on the king's summons he
would not take his trial, he was outlawed from England.

In the year of grace 1173, being the nineteenth year of the
reign of king Henry, son of the empress Matilda, the said
king was, on the day of the Nativity of our Lord, at Chinon,
in Anjou, and queen Eleanor was there with him, while the
king, his son, and his wife were in Normandy. After the
Nativity, the king, the father, sent for the king, the son, and
they proceeded to Montferrat, in Auvergne, where they were
met by Hubert, earl of Maurienne, who brought with him Alice,
his eldest daughter. The king, the father, obtained her for the
sum of four thousand marks of silver, as a wife for his son John,
together with the whole of the earldom of Maurienne, in case
the above-named earl should not have a son by his wife. But, in
case he should have a son, lawfully begotten, then the

above-named earl granted to them and to their heirs for ever
Bxmsillon, with all his jurisdiction therein, and with all its
appurtenances, and the whole of the county of Le Belay, as
he then held the same ; likewise, Pierrecastel, with all its
appurtenances, and the whole of the valley 'of Novalese, and
Chambery, with all its appurtenances, and Aix, and Aspermont,
and Rochet, and Montemayor, and Chambres, with the borough
and the whole jurisdiction thereof. All these lying on this
side of the mountains, with all their appurtenances, he granted
to them immediately for ever. Beyond the mountains, also, he
gave and granted to them and to their heirs forever, the whole
of Turin, with all its appurtenances, the college of Canorech, 17
with all its appurtenances, and all the fees which the earls of
Cannes held of him, and their services and fealties. Also,
in the earldom of Castro, he granted similar fees, fealties, and
services. In the Val D'Aosta he granted to them Castig-
lione, which the viscount D'Aosta held of him, to hold the
same for ever against all men. All these the above-named
earl granted to the said son of the king of England for ever,
together with his daughter before-mentioned, as freely, fully,
and quietly, in men and cities, castles, and other places of
defence, meadows, leasowes, mills, woods, plains, waters,
vallies, mountains, customs, and all other things, as ever
he or his father had held or enjoyed all the same as under-
written therein, or even more fully and freely. Further-
more, the said earl was willing immediately, or whenever
it should please our lord the king of England, that homage
and fealty should be done by all his people throughout the
whole of his lands, saving always their fealty to himself so long
as he should hold the same. Moreover, he granted to them and
In their heirs for ever, all the right that he had in the county
of Grenoble, and whatsoever he might acquire therein. But
in case his eldest daughter above-named should happen to die,
whatever he had granted Avith the eldest, he did thereby grant
the whole of the same, as therein written, together with his
second daughter, to the son of the illustrious king of England.
That the covenants above- written should be kept between
our lord the king of England and the earl of Maurienne, both
the earl of Maurienne himself, and the count de Cevennes, and
nearly all the other nobles of his territory, made oath ; to
17 Holinshed calls this place " Gavoreth."



364 ANNALS Of JROGER DE HOVEDEN. A.b. 1173

the effect that the earl of Maurienne would inviolably observe
the said covenants; and if he should in any way depart
therefrom, they made oath that, on the summons of our lord
the king of England, or of his messenger, and even without
any such summons, so soon as they should happen to know that
the earl had so departed, they would, from the time of knowing
thereof, surrender themselves as hostages to our lord the king
of England, in his own realm, wherever he should think fit;
and would remain in his custody until such time as they should
have prevailed upon the earl to perform the king's pleasure- or
have made an arrangement with the king, to his satisfaction.

Furthermore, Peter, the venerable archbishop of Tarentaise,
Ardune, bishop of Cevennes, William, bishop of Maurienne,
and the abbat of Saint Michael, the Holy Evangelists being
placed before them, at the command of the earl, steadfastly
promised that, at the will and pleasure of the king, and
at such time as he should think fit, they would excommuni-
cate the person of the earl, and place his lands under inter-
dict, if the earl should not observe the. agreement so made be-
tween them ; that they would also do the same as to the per-
sons of the earl's liegemen, and as to the lands of those through
whom it should be caused, that the agreement so made between
the king and the earl was not observed, and would hold those
who should refuse to keep the peace and their lands under in-
terdict, until satisfaction should have been made to our lord
the king.

Our lord the king made these covenants and the grants
above- written, with and to the earl of Maurienne, and by his
command the following made oath that by him the same should
be observed : William, earl of MandevUle, William, earl of
Arundel, Ralph de Fay, William de Courcy, William de
Hinnez, Fulk Paynel, Robert de Briencourt, William Mainegot,
Theobald Chabot, William de Munlufzun, Peter de Montesson,
and Geoffrey Forrester .

In addition thereto, it was to be understood that the earl might
give his second daughter in marriage to whomsoever he would,
without too greatly diminishing the earldom, after his eldest
daughter should have been married to the king's son, either
her lawful age allowing thereof, or through the dispensation of
the Church of Rome ; and that it should be lawful for her pa-
rents or for other persons to give from the lands, for the safety



A.n. 1173. TREATY WITH THE EARL OF MAURIENNE. 365

of her soul, without too greatly diminishing the earldom. Also,
that the king should make payment immediately to the earl
of one thousand marks of silver ; and that as soon as he should
receive the earl's daughter, the latter should have at least
another thousand marks of silver; and that whatever should
remain unpaid of the five thousand marks, the earl should
receive the same when the marriage should have taken place
between the king's son and the earl's daughter, either by reason
of lawful age or throughthe dispensation of the Church of Rome.
But, if our lord the king, which God forbid, should chance
to die first, or should depart from his territories, then, neither
he nor they who, at his command had made oath and had given
any security to the earl, should be bound by the covenants
above- written, but only our lord the king, the king's son and
his people.

Accordingly, a few days having elapsed, there came into the
territories of the king of England, on behalf of the earl of
Maurienne, the marquis of Montferrat, Geoffrey de Plozac, and
Merlo, his son, the chancellor of earl Richard, and Berlo de
Cambot, and Peter de Bouet, his castellans, together with Peter
de Saint Genese, and Peter de Turin, knights, and Geoffrey
de Aquabella, and Ralph de Varci, burgesses. Touching the
Holy Evangelists, these persons made oath that they would
strictly cause the earl to observe the covenants made between
the king and the earl, as to the son of the king and the daugh-
ter of the earl, in such manner as they had been lawfully entered
into, written, and understood. And, if he should not ob-
serve the same, they made oath that, on the summons of
the king or of his messenger, or even without any such sum-
mons, if they should happen to know that the earl had de-
parted therefrom, they would, from the time of knowing there-
of, surrender themselves as hostages to the king in his own
realm, and would remain in his custody until such time as
they should have prevailed upon the earl to perform the king's
pleasure, or have made an arrangement with our lord the king
to his satisfaction. The before-named envoys also made
oath that the earl should not give his second daughter
in marriage until his eldest daughter should have been
united in marriage with the king's son, either by reason
of being of lawful age, or through the dispensation of the
Church of Rome ; unless by the consent and desire of our lord



S66 ANNALS OF KOGER DE HOVEDEff. A.D. 1173.

the king he should in the meantime have given her in marriage
to some other person. They also made oath that, if the earl's
daughter, or, which God forbid, the king's son, should chance
to die before a marriage should have taken place between them,
then the earl should repay to the king the whole of the money,
or act according to the king's will and pleasure relative thereto,
or pay it over to him to whom the king should assign the same ;
and that they, the parties making the said oath, would,
if the king should so wish, and at such time as he should so
wish, surrender themselves as hostages in his realm and into
his power until such time as the same should be paid. They
likewise made oath that they would use their best endeavours
to obtain the grant of Umbert the Younger, in order that
thereby the king's son might have Kousillon and Pierrecastel,
and whatever had been granted to him by the earl in the
county of Le Belay. But if Umbert should happen to re-
fuse to grant the same, then they made oath that the earl
should give him lands in lawful exchange thereof, accord-
ing to the arbitration of the abbat of Cluse, and of Reginald,
archdeacon of Salisbury, or of other lawful persons thereto
appointed by the king, if they should not be able to be
present.

After this, the king of England, the father, and the king, the
son, came together to Limoges ; and thither Raymond, earl of
Saint Gilles, came, and there did homage to both the kings of
England, and to Richard, earl of Poitou, for Toulouse, to hold
the same of them by hereditary right, by the service of ap-
pearing before them at their summons, and staying with
them and serving for forty days, without any cost on their
part ; but if they should wish to have him longer in their
service, then they were to pay his reasonable expenses. And
further, the said earl of Saint Gilles was to give them from
Toulouse and its appurtenances one hundred marks of silver,
or else ten chargers worth ten marks a-piece.

There also came to Limoges the earl of Maurienne, and de-
sired to know how much of his own territory the king of Eng-
land intended to grant to his son John ; and on the king ex-
pressing an intention to give him the castle of Chinon, the castle
of Lodun, and the castle of Mirabel, the king, his son, would
in nowise agree thereto, nor allow it to be done. For he was
already greatly offended that his father was unwilling to assign



A.D. 1173. PRINCE HENRY REVOLTS FROM HIS FATHER. 367

to him some portion of his territories, where he, with his wife,
might take up their residence. Indeed, he had requested his
father to give him either Normandy, or Anjou, or England,
which request he had made at the suggestion of the king of
France, and of those of the earls and barons of England and
Normandy who disliked his father : and from this time it was
that the king, the son, had been seeking pretexts and an oppor-
tunity for withdrawing from his father. And he had now
so entirely revolted in feeling from obeying his wishes, that
he could not even converse with him on any subject in a peace-
able manner.

Having now gained his opportunity, both as to place and
pccasion, the king, the son, left his father, and proceeded
to the king of France. However, Eichard Barre, his chan-
cellor, "Walter, his chaplain, Ailward, his chamberlain, and
"William Blund, his apparitor, left him, and returned to the
king, his father. Thus did the king's son lose both his feel-
ings and his senses ; he repulsed the innocent, persecuted a
father, usurped authority, seized upon a kingdom; he alone
was the guilty one, and yet a whole army conspired against
his father ; "so does the madness of one make many mad." 17
For he it was who thirsted for the blood of a father, the gore
of a parent !

In the meantime, Louis, king of the Franks, held a great
council at Paris, at which he and all the principal men of
France made oath to the son of the king of England that they
would assist him in every way in expelling his father from
the kingdom, if he should not accede to his wishes : on which
he swore to them that he would not make peace with his
father, except with their sanction and consent. After this, he
swore that he would give to Philip, earl of Flanders, for his
tomage, a thousand pounds of yearly revenues in England,
and the whole of Kent, together with Dover castle, and Ro-
chester castle ; to Matthew, earl of Boulogne, for his ho-
mage, the Soke of Kirketon in Lindsey, and the earldom of
Mortaigne, with the honor of Hay ; and to Theobald, earl
of Blois, for his homage, two hundred 18 pounds of yearly
revenues in Anjou, and the castle of Amboise, with all the
jurisdiction which he had claimed to hold in Touraine ; and he

17 " Unius dementia dementes efficit multos."

18 A various reading makes it five hundred.



368 ANNALS OF ttOGEE DE HOVEDEIf. A.D. 1173.

also quitted claim to him of all right that the king his father
and himself had claimed in Chateau Regnaud. All these gifts,
and many besides that he made to other persons, he confirmed
under his new seal, which the king of France had ordered to
be made for him.

Besides these, he made other gifts, which, under the same
seal, he confirmed ; namely, to William, king of Scotland, for
his assistance, the whole of Northumberland as far as the
river Tyne. To the brother of the same king he gave for his
services the earldom of Huntingdon and of Cambridgeshire,
and to earl Hugh Bigot, for his services, the castle of Norwich.

Immediately after Easter, in this year, the whole of the
kingdom of France, and the king, the son of the king of
England, Richard his brother, earl of Poitou, and Geoffrey,
earl of Bretagne, and nearly all the earls and barons of Eng-
land, Normandy, Aquitaine, Anjou, and Brittany, arose against
the king of England the father, and laid waste his lands on
every side with fire, sword, and rapine : they also laid siege to
his castles, and took them by storm, and there was no one to
relieve them. Still, he made all the resistance against them
that he possibly could : for he had with him twenty thou-
sand Brabanters, who served him faithfully, but not without
large pay which he gave them.

Then seems to have been fulfilled this prophecy of Merlin,
which says : " The cubs shall awake and shall roar aloud, and,
leaving the woods, shall seek their prey within the walls of
the cities ; among those who shall be in their way they shall
make great carnage, and shall tear out the tongues of bulls.
The necks of them as they roar aloud they shall load with
chains, and shall thus renew the times of their forefathers."

Upon this, the king wrote letters of complaint to all the
emperors and kings whom he thought to be friendly to him, rela-
tive to the misfortunes which had befallen him through the
exalted position which he had given to his sons, strongly ad-
vising them not to exalt their own sons beyond what it was
their duty to do. On receiving his letter, William king of
Sicily wrote to him to the following effect :

" To Henry, by the grace of God the illustrious king of
the English, duke of Normandy and Aquitaine, and earl of
Anjou, William, by the same grace, king of Sicily, the duke-
dom of Apulia, and the principality of Capua, the enjoyment



A.D. 1173. INVASION OF NOBHANDY. 369

of health, and the wished-for triumph in victory over his
enemies. On the receipt of your letter, we learned a thing
of which indeed we cannot withoiit the greatest astonishment
make mention, how that, forgetting the ordinary usages of
humanity and violating the law of nature, the son has risen in
rebellion against the father, the begotten against the begetter,
the bowels have been moved to intestine war, the entrails
have had recourse to arms, and, a new miracle taking place,
quite unheard of in our times, the flesh has waged war against
the blood, and the blood has sought means how to shed
itself. And, although for the purpose of checking the violence
of such extreme madness, the inconvenience of the distance does
not allow of our power affording any assistance, still, with all the
loving-kindness we possibly can, the expression of which,
distance of place does not prevent, sincerely embracing your
person and honor, we sympathize with your sorrow, and are
indignant at your persecution, which we regard as though it
were our own. However, we do hope and trust in the Lord, by
whose judgment the judgments of kings are directed, that He
will no longer allow your sons to be tempted beyond what
they are able or ought to endure ; and that He who became
obedient to the Father even unto death, will inspire them with
the light of filial obedience, whereby they shall be brought to
recollect that they are your flesh and blood, and, leaving the
errors of their hostility, shall acknowledge themselves to be
your sons, and return to their father, and thereby heal the dis-
ruption of nature, and that the former union, being restored,
will cement the bonds of natural affection."

Accordingly, immediately after Easter, as previously men-
tioned, the wicked fury of the traitors burst forth. For, raving
with diabolical frenzy, they laid waste the territories of the king
of England on both sides of the sea with fire and sword in every
direction. Philip, earl of Flanders, with a large army, entered
Normandy, and laid siege to Aumarle, and took it. Proceed-
ing thence, he laid siege to the castle of Drincourt, which
was surrendered to him ; here his brother Matthew, earl of
Boulogne, died of a wound which he received from an arrow
when off his guard. On his decease, his brother Peter, the
bishop elect of Cambray, succeeded him in the earldom of
Boulogne, and renouncing his election, was made a knight, but
died shortly after without issue.

370 ANNALS OP ROGER DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1173,

In the meantime, Louis, king of the Franks, and the king of
England, the son, laid siege to Verneuil ; but Hugh de Lacy
and Hugh de Beauchamp, who were the constables thereof,
defended the town of Verneuil boldly and with resolute
spirit. In consequence of this, the king of France, after
remaining there a whole month, with difficulty took a small
portion of the town on the side where his engines of war
had been planted. There were in Verneuil, besides the castle,
three burghs ; each of which was separated from the other,
and enclosed with a strong wall and a foss filled with water.
One of these was called the Great Burgh, beyond the walls of
which were pitched the tents of the king of France and his
engines of war. At the end of this month, when the burghers
in the Great Burgh saw that food and necessaries were failing
them, and that they should have nothing to eat, being com-
pelled by hunger and want, they made a truce for three days
with the king of France, for the purpose of going to their lord
the king of England, in order to obtain succour of him ; and
they made an agreement that if they should not have succour
within the next three days, they would surrender to him that
burgh. The peremptory day for so doing was appointed on
the vigil of Saint Laurence.

They then gave hostages to the king of France to the above
effect, and the king of France, the king of England, the son,
and earl Robert, the brother of the king of France, earl
Henry de Trois, Theobald, earl of Blois, and William, arch-
bishop of Sens, made oath to them, that if they should sur-
render the burgh to the king of France at the period
named, the king of France would restore to them their hos-
tages free and unmolested, and would do no injury to
them, nor allow it to be done by others. This composition
having been made to the above effect, the burgesses before-
mentioned came to their lord the king of England, and an-
nounced to him the agreement which they had made with the
king of France and the king his son.

On hearing of this, the king of England collected as large an
army as he possibly could from Normandy and the rest of
his dominions, and came to Breteuil, a castle belonging to
Robert, earl of Leicester, which the earl himself, taking to
flight on his approach, left without any protection. This
the king entirely reduced to ashes, and the next day, for the
purpose of engaging with the king of France, proceeded to a



A.D. 1173. FLIGHT OP THE KING OP FRANCE. 371

high hill, near Verneuil, with the whole of his army, and
drew up his troops in order of battle. This too was the peremp-
tory day upon which that portion of Verneuil was to be
surrendered if it did not obtain succour.

Upon this, Louis, king of the Franks, sent "William, arch-
bishop of Sens, earl Henry, and earl Theobald, to the king of
England, the father, who appointed an interview to be held be-
tween them on the morrow ; and the king of England, to his
misfortune, placed confidence in them ; for he was deceived.
For on the morrow the king of France neither came to the in-
terview, nor yet sent any messenger. On this, the king of Eng-
land sent out spies to observe the position of the king of France
and his army ; but while the spies were delaying their return,
that portion of Verneuil was surrendered to the king of France
to which he had laid siege. However, he did not dare re-
tain it in his hands, having transgressed the oath which he
had made to the burghers. For he neither restored to them
their hostages, nor preserved the peace as he had promised ;
but, entering the town, made the burghers prisoners, carried
off their property, set fire to the Burgh, and then, taking to
flight, carried away with him the burghers before-mentioned
into France.

When word was brought of this to the king of England, he
pursued them with the edge of the sword, slew many of
them, and took considerable numbers, and at nightfall ar-
rived at Verneuil, where he remained one night, and ordered
the walls which had been levelled to be rebuilt. But, in
order that these events may be kept in memory, it is as well to
know that this flight of the king of France took place on the
fifth day before the ides of August, being the fifth day of the
week, upon the vigil of Saint Laurence, to the praise and
glory of our Lord Jesus Christ, who by punishing the crime of
perfidy, so speedily avenged the indignity done to his Martyr.

On the following day, the king of England, the father, left
Verneuil, and took the castle of Damville, which belonged to
Gilbert de Tilieres, and captured with it a great number of
knights and men-at-anns. After this, the king came to Rouen,
and thence dispatched his Brabanters, in whom he placed
more confidence than the rest, into Brittany, against Hugh,
earl of Chester, and Ralph de Fougeres, who had now gained
possession of nearly the whole of it. When these troops ap-

preached, the earl of Chester and Ralph de Fougeres went
forth to meet them. In consequence of this, preparations were
made for battle ; the troops were drawn out in battle array, and
everything put in readiness for the combat. Accordingly, the
engagement having commenced, the enemies of the king of
England were routed, and the men of Brittany were laid pros-
trate and utterly defeated. The earl, however, and Ralph de
Fougeres, with many of the most powerful men of Brittany,
shut themselves up in the fort of Dol, which they had taken
by stratagem ; 19 on which, the Brabanters besieged them on
every side, on the thirteenth day before the calends of Septem-
ber, being the second day of the week. In this battle there
were taken by the Brabanters seventeen knights remarkable
for their valour, whose names were as follows : Hascuil de
Saint Hilaire, William Patrick, Patrick de la Laude, Haimer
de Falaise, Geoffrey Farcy, William de Rulent, Ralph de
Sens, John Boteler, Vicaire de Dol, William des Loges, William
de la Motte, Robert de Treham, Payen Cornute, Reginald
Pincun, Reginald de Champ Lambert, and Eudo Bastard. 19 *
Besides these, many others were captured, both horse and foot,
and more than fifteen hundred of the Bretons were slain.

Now, on the day after this capture and slaughter, " Ru-
mour, than which nothing in speed more swift exists," 20
reached the ears of the king of England, who, immediately
setting out on his march towards Dol, arrived there on the fifth
day of the week, and immediately ordered his stone-engines,
and other engines of war, to be got in readiness. The earl of
Chester, however, and those who were with him in the fort, being
unable to defend it, surrendered it to the king, on the seven-
teenth day before the calends of September, being the Lord's
Day ; and, in like manner, the whole of Brittany, with all its
fortresses, was restored to him, and its chief men were carried into
captivity. In the fortress of Dol many knights and yeomen were
taken prisoners, whose names were as follow : Hugh, earl of
Chester, Ralph de Fougeres, William de Fougeres, Hamo 21

.After these victories which God granted to the king of Eng-
land, the son of the empress Matilda, the king of France and
his supporters fell into despondency, and used all possible
endeavours, that peace might be made between the king of
England and his sons. In consequence of this, there was at
length a meeting between Gisors and Trie, at which Louis, king
of the Franks, attended, accompanied by the archbishops,
bishops, earls, and barons of his realm, and bringing with him
Henry, Richard, and Geoffrey, the sons of the king of England.
Henry, king of England, the father, attended, with the arch-
bishops, bishops, earls, and barons of his dominions.

A conference was accordingly held between him and his sons,
for the purpose of establishing peace, on the seventh day before
the calends of October, being the third day of the week. At
this conference, the king, the father, offered to the king, his



374 ANNALS OF EOGEB DE HOYEDEJT. A.D. 1173.

son, a moiety of the revenues of his demesnes in England,
and four fitting castles in the same territory ; or, if his
son should prefer to remain in Normandy, the king, the
father, offered a moiety of the revenues of Normandy, and all
the revenues of the lands that were his father's, the earl of
Anjou, and three convenient castles in Normandy, and one
fitting castle in Anjou, one fitting castle in Maine, and one
fitting castle in Touraine. To his son Eichard, also, he offered
a moiety of the revenues of Aquitaine, and four fitting castles
in the same territory. And to his son Geoffrey he offered all
the lands that belonged, by right of inheritance, to the
daughter of duke Conan, if he should, with the sanction of our
lord the pope, be allowed to marry the above-named lady. The
king, the father, also submitted himself entirely to the arbi-
tration of the archbishop of Tarento and the legates of our
lord the pope, as to adding to the above as much more of his
revenues, and giving the same to his sons, as they should
pronounce to be reasonable, reserving to himself the adminis-
tration of justice and the royal authority.

But it did not suit the purpose of the king of France that
the king's sons should at present make peace with their father:
in addition to which, at the same conference, Robert, earl of
Leicester, uttered much opprobrious and abusive language to the
king of England, the father, and laid his hand on his sword for
the purpose of striking the king; but he was hindered by
the byestanders from so doing, and the conference was imme-
diately brought to a close.

On the day after the conference, the knights of the king of
France had a skirmish with the knights of the king of England,
between Curteles and Gisors ; in which fight Ingelram, castel-
lan of Trie, was made prisoner by earl "William de Mandeville,
and presented to the king, the father. In the meantime, Robert,
earl of Leicester, having raised a large army, crossed over
into England, and was received by earl Hugh Bigot in the
castle of Fremingham, 22 where he supplied him with all
necessaries. After this, the said Robert, earl of Leicester,
laid siege to Hakeneck, the castle of Ranulph de Broc, and
took it; for, at this period, Richard de Lucy, justiciary of
England, and Humphrey de Bohun, the king's constable,
had marched with a large army into Lothian, the territory of
the king of Scotland, for the purpose of ravaging it.

When, however, they heard of the arrival of the earl of Lei-
cester in England, they were greatly alarmed, and laying all
other matters aside, gave and received a truce from the king of
Scotland, and, after hostages were delivered on both sides for
the preservation of peaee until the feast of Saint Hilary, has-
tened with all possible speed to Saint Edmund's. Thither
also came to them Reginald, earl of Cornwall, the king's uncle,
Robert, earl of Gloucester, and "William, earl of Arundel,
On the approach of the festival of All Saints, the above-named
earl of Leicester withdrew from Fremingham for the purpose
of marching to Leicester, and came with his army to a place
near St. Edmund's, which is known as Fornham, situate on
a piece of marshy ground, not far from the church of Saint
Genevieve. On his arrival being known, the earls, with
a considerable force, and Humphrey de Bohun with three
hundred knights, soldiers of the king, went forth armed
for battle to meet the earl of Leicester, carrying before them
the banner of Saint Edmund the king and Martyr as their
standard. The ranks being drawn up in battle array, by
virtue of the aid of God and of his most glorious Martyr Saint
Edmund, they attacked the line in which the earl of Leicester
had taken his position, and in a moment, in the twinkling of
an eye, the earl of Leicester was vanquished and taken prisoner,
as also his wife and Hugh des Chateaux, a nobleman of the
kingdom of France, and all their might was utterly crushed.

There fell in this battle more than ten thousand Flemings,
while all the rest were taken prisoners, and being thrown
into prison in irons, were there starved to death. As for the
earl of Leicester and his wife and Hugh des Chateaux, and the
rest of the more wealthy men who were captured with them,
they were sent into Normandy to the king the father ; on which
the king placed them in confinement at Falaise, and Hugh, earl
of Chester, with them.

On the feast of Saint Martin, king Henry, the father, entered
Anjou with his army, and shortly after Geoffrey, lord of Hay,
surrendered to him the castle of Hay. After this there
were surrendered to him the castle of Pruilly and the castle
of Campigny, which Robert de Ble had held against him. In
this castle there were many knights and men-at-arms taken pri-
soners, whose names were as follow : Haimeric de Ble, Baldwin
de Brisehaie, Hugh de Laloc, Hugh de Danars, HughDelamotte,

In the same year, Louis, king of the Pranks, knighted
Richard, the son of king Henry. In this year, also, Robert the
prior of Dare, who was bishop elect of the church of Arras, re-
nounced that election, and was elected bishop of the diocese
of Cambrai, but before he was consecrated was slain by his
enemies. In the same year, Henry, king of England, con-
trary to the prohibition of his son, king Henry, and after
appeal made to our lord the pope, gave the archbishopric
of Canterbury, to Richard prior of Dover, the bishopric of
Bath to Reginald, son of Jocelyn, bishop of Salisbury, the
bishopric of Winchester to Richard de Ivechester, archdeacon
of Poitou, the bishopric of Hereford to Robert Folliot, the
bishopric of Ely to Geoffrey Riddel, archdeacon of Canter-
bury, and the bishopric of Chichester to John de Greneford.
After this, at the time of the feast of Saint Andrew, the king
of England, the father, took Vend6me by storm, which was
held against him by Bucard de Lavardin, who had expelled
therefrom his father, the earl of Vendome.

In the year of grace 1174, being the twentieth year of
the reign of king Henry, son of the empress Matilda, the
said Henry spent the festival of the Nativity of our Lord at
Caen in Normandy, and a truce was made between him and
Louis, king of the Franks, from the feast of Saint Hilary until
the end of Easter. In the same year, and at the time above-
named, Hugh, bishop of Durham, at an interview held between
himself and William, king of the Scots, on the confines of the
kingdoms of England and Scotland, namely at Revedeur, gave

to the above-named king of the Scots three hundred marks of
silver from the lands of the barons of Northumberland, for
granting a truce from the feast of Saint Hilary until the end of
Easter.

In the meantime, Roger de Mowbray fortified his castle at
Kinardeferie, in Axholme ; w and Hugh, bishop of Durham,
fortified the castle of Alverton. 24 After Easter, breaking the
truce, Henry, the son of the king of England, and Philip, earl
of Flanders, having raised a large army, determined to come
over to England.

In the meantime, William, king of the Scots, came into
Northumberland with a large force, and there with his Scotch
and Galloway men committed execrable deeds. For his
men ripped asunder pregnant women, and, dragging forth the
embryos, tossed them upon the points of lances. Infants,
children, youths, aged men, all of both sexes, from the highest
to the lowest, they slew alike without mercy or ransom. The
priests and clergy they murdered in the very churches upon
the altars. Consequently, wherever the Scots and the Gallo-
way men came, horror and carnage prevailed. Shortly after,
the king of the Scots sent his brother David to Leicester,
in order to assist the troops of the earl of Leicester ; but be-
fore he arrived there, Reginald, earl of Cornwall, and Richard
de Lacy, justiciary of England, had burned the city of Leices-
ter to the ground, together with its churches and buildings,
with the exception of the castle.

After Pentecost, Anketill Mallory, the constable of Leicester,
fought a battle with the burgesses of Northampton, and de-
feated them, taking more than two hundred prisoners, and
slaying a considerable number. Shortly after, Robert, earl of
Ferrers, together with the knights of Leicester, came at day-
break to Nottingham, a royal town, which Reginald de Lucy
had in his charge ; and having taken it, sacked it, and then
set it on fire, carrying away with him the burgesses thereof.

At this period, Geoffrey, bishop elect of Lincoln, son of
king Henry, 25 took the castle of Kinardeferie, and levelled
it with the ground. Also, Robert 26 de Mowbray, the con-

stable of the same castle, while going towards Leicester to ob-
tain assistance, was taken prisoner on the road, by the people of
Clay, and detained. Earl Hugh Bigot also took the city of
Norwich by storm, and burned it. In addition to this, the
bishop elect of Lincoln, with Roger, the archbishop of York,
laid siege to Malasert, a castle belonging to Roger de Mowbray,
and took it, with many knights and men-at-arms therein, and
gave it into the charge of the archbishop of York. Before
he departed, he also fortified the castle of Topcliffe, which he
delivered into the charge of William de Stuteville.

In the meantime, Richard, the archbishop elect of Canter-
bury, and Reginald, the bishop elect of Bath, set out for Rome,
for the purpose of confirming their own elections and those of
the other bishops elect of England. To oppose them, king
Henry, the son, sent to Rome Master Berter, a native of Or-
leans. When the said parties had come into the presence
of pope Alexander, and the cardinals, and our lord the pope
had greatly censured the absence of the other bishops elect of
England, and the archbishop elect of Canterbury had done all
in his power to exculpate them, our lord the pope asked, with
still greater earnestness, why the bishop elect of Ely had not
come; on which Berter of Orleans made answer: "My lord,
he has a Scriptural excuse;" 26 to whom the pope made
answer : " Brother, what is the excuse ?" on which the other
replied : " He has married a wife, and therefore cannot come."
In the end, however, although there was a great altercation
and considerable bandying of hard language on both sides be-
fore our lord the pope and the cardinals, our lord the pope
confirmed the election of the archbishop of Canterbury : on
which, Reginald, the bishop elect of Bath, wrote to his master
the king of England to the following eifect :

" To Henry, the illustrious king of England, duke of Nor-
mandy and Aquitaine, and earl of Anjou, his most dearly
beloved lord, Reginald, by the grace of God, bishop elect
of Bath, health in Him who gives health to kings. Be it
known to the prudence of your majesty, that, at the court
of our lord the pope, we found determined opponents from
the kingdom of France, and others still more determined from
your own territories. In consequence of this, we were obliged
to submit to many hardships there, and to make a tedious stay,
till at last, at our repeated entreaties, by the co-operation of
26 Alluding to St. Luke xiv. 20.



A.D. 1174. THE KING OF THE SCOTS BESIEGES CABLISLE. 379

the Divine grace, the obduracy of our lord the pope was so far
softened, that, in the presence of all, he solemnly confirmed
the election of the lord archbishop elect of Canterbury; and after
having so confirmed his election, consecrated him on the Lord's
day following. On the third day after his consecration, he
gave him the pall, and a short period of time having inter-
vened, conferred on him the dignity of the primacy. In ad-
dition to this, it being our desire that he should have full
power of inflicting ecclesiastical vengeance upon those men of
your realms who have iniquitously and in the treachery of their
wickedness, raised their heel against your innocence, we did,
after much solicitation, obtain the favour of the bestowal by our
lord the pope of the legateship on the same province. As for
my own election, and those of the others, they are matters still
in suspense ; and our lord the pope has determined to settle and
determine nothing with regard to us, until such time as your son
shall have been brought to a reconciliation. However, we put
our trust in the Lord that the interests of myself, and of all
the other bishops elect, may be safely entrusted to the prudent
care of my lord the archbishop of Canterbury."

In the same year, at the feast of the Nativity of Saint John
the Baptist, Eichard de Lucy laid siege to the castle of Hun-
tingdon, on which the knights of that castle burned the town
to the ground. Kichard de Lucy then erected a new castle
before the gates of the said castle of Huntingdon, and gave
it in charge to earl Simon.

In the meanwhile, William, king of the Scots, laid siege to
Carlisle, of which Robert de Vals had the safe keeping ; and,
leaving a portion of his army to continue the siege, with the
remainder of it he passed through Northumberland, ravaging
the lands of the king and his barons. He took the castle
of Liddel, the castle of Burgh, the castle of Appleby, the
castle of Mercwrede, and the castle of Irebothe, which was
held by Odonel de Umfraville, after which he returned to the
siege of Carlisle. Here he continued the siege, until Robert
de Vals, in consequence of provisions failing him and the
other persons there, made a treaty with him on the follow-
ing terms, namely, that, at the feast of Saint Michael next
ensuing, he would surrender to him the castle and town of
Carlisle, unless, in the meantime, he should obtain succour
from his master the king of England.



380 ANNALS OF EOGEB DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1174.

On this, the king of the Scots, departing thence, laid siege to
the castle of Prudhoe, which belonged to Odonel de Umfra-
ville, but was unable to take it. For Robert de Stuteville,
sheriff of York, William de Vesci, Ranulph de Glanville,
Ralph de Tilly, constable of the household of the arch-
bishop of York, Bernard de Baliol, and Odonel de Umfraville,
having assembled a large force, hastened to its succour.

On learning their approach, the king of Scotland retreated
thence, and laid siege to the castle of Alnwick, which belonged
to William de Vesci, and then, dividing his army into three
divisions, kept one with himself, and gave the command of
the other two to earl Dunecan and the earl of Angus, and Ri-
chard de Morville, giving them orders to lay waste the
neighbouring provinces in all directions, slaughter the people,
and carry off the spoil. Oh, shocking times ! then might you
have heard the shrieks of women, the cries of the aged, the
groans of the dying, and the exclamations of despair of the
youthful !

In the meantime, the king of England, the son, and Philip,
earl of Flanders, came with a large army to Gravelines, for
the purpose of crossing over to England. On hearing of this,
the king of England, the father, who had marched with his
army into Poitou, and had taken many fortified places and
castles, together with the city of Saintes, and two fortresses
there, one of which was called Fort Maror, as also the cathedral
church of Saintes, which the knights and men-at-arms had
strengthened against him with arms and a supply of provisions,
returned into Anjou, and took the town of Ancenis, which be-
longed to Guion de Ancenis, near Saint Florence. On taking it,
he strengthened it with very strong fortifications, and retained
it in his own hands, and then laid waste the adjoining parts of
the province with fire and sword ; he also rooted up the vines
and fruit-bearing trees, after which he returned into Normandy,
while the king, his son, and Philip, earl of Flanders, were still
detained at Gravelines, as the wind was contrary, and they were
unable to cross over. On this, the king of England, the father,
came to Barbeflet, 27 where a considerable number of ships had
been assembled against his arrival, and, praised be the name of
the Lord ! as it pleased the Lord, so did it come to pass ; who, by
His powerful might, changed the wind to a favourable quarter,
27 Harfleur.

and thus suddenly granted him a passage over to England. Im-
mediately on this, he embarked, and, on the following day,
landed at Southampton, in England, on the eight day before
the ides of July, being the second day of the week, bringing
with him his wife, queen Eleanor, and queen Margaret,
daughter of Louis, king of the Franks, and wife of his son
Henry, with Robert, earl of Leicester, and Hugh, earl of
Chester, whom he immediately placed in confinement.

On the day after this, he set out on a pilgrimage to the tomb
of Saint Thomas the Martyr, archbishop of Canterbury. On his
approach, as soon as he was in sight of the church, in which
the body of the blessed martyr lay buried, he dismounted
from the horse on which he rode, took off his shoes, and,
barefoot, and clad in woollen garments, walked three miles to
the tomb of the martyr, with such humility and compunction
of heart, that it may be believed beyond a doubt to have been
the work of Him who looketh down on the earth, and maketh
it to tremble. To those who beheld them, his footsteps,
along the road on which he walked, seemed to be covered with
blood, and really were so ; for his tender feet being cut by the
hard stones, a great quantity of blood flowed from them on to
the ground. When he had arrived at the tomb, it was a holy
thing to see the affliction which he suffered, with sobs and
tears, and the discipline to which he submitted from the hands
of the bishops and a great number of priests and monks. Here,
also, aided by the prayers of many holy men, he passed the
night, before the sepulchre of the blessed Martyr, in prayer,
fasting, and lamentations. As for the gilts and revenues
which, for the remission of his sins, he bestowed on this church,
they can never under any circumstance be obliterated from the
remembrance thereof. In the morning of the following day,
mfter hearing mass, he departed thence, on the third day be-
fore the ides of July, being Saturday, with the intention of
proceeding to London. And, inasmuch as he was mindful of
the Lord in his entire heart, the Lord granted unto him the vic-
tory over his enemies, and delivered them captive into his hands.

For, on the very same Saturday on which the king left
Canterbury, William, king of the Scots, was taken prisoner at
Alnwick by the above-named knights of Yorkshire, who had
pursued him after his retreat from Prudhoe. Thus, even
thus; "How rarely is it that vengeance with halting step

forsakes the pursuit of the wicked !" M Together with him,
there were taken prisoners Richard Cumin, William de Mor-
timer, William de 1'Isle, Henry Revel, Ralph de Ver, Jor-
dan le Fleming, Waltheof Fitz-Baldwin de Bicre, Richard
Maluvcl, and many others, who voluntarily allowed them-
selves to be made prisoners, lest they might appear to have
sanctioned the capture of their lord.

On the same day, Hugh, count de Bar sur Seine, nephew of
Hugh, bishop of Durham, effected a landing, at Herterpol 29 with
forty knights and five hundred Flemings, for whom the before-
named bishop had sent ; but in consequence of the capture of
the king of Scotland, the bishop immediately allowed the
said Flemings to return home, having first given them allow-
ance and pay for forty days. Count Hugh, however, together
with the knights who had come with him, he made to stay, and
gave the castle of Alverton 30 into their safe keeping.

These things having taken place, Uctred, the son of Fergus,
and Gilbert his brother, the leaders of the men of Galloway,
immediately upon the capture of their lord the king of the
Scots, returned to their country, expelled the king's thanes
from their territories, and slew without mercy those of
English or French origin whom they found therein. The
fortresses and castles which the king of the Scots had fortified
in their territories they laid siege to, and, capturing them,
levelled them with the ground. They also earnestly entreated
the king of England, the father, at the same time presenting
him many gifts, to rescue them from the rule of the king of
Scotland, and render them subject to his own sway.

In the meantime, Louis, king of the Franks, hearing that the
king of England, the father, had crossed over, and that the king
of Scots was taken prisoner, with whose misfortunes he greatly
condoled, recalled the king of England the son, and Philip, earl
of Flanders, who were still staying at Gravelines ; and after they
had returned to him, laid siege to Rouen on all sides, except
that on which the river Seine flows.

The king, the father, on hearing of the capture of the king
of the Scots, rejoiced with exceeding great joy, and after a thanks-
giving to Almighty God and the blessed martyr Thomas, set out

for Huntingdon, and laid siege to the castle, which was surren-
dered to him on the Lord's day following, being the twelfth day
before the calends of August. The knights and men-at-arms
who were in the castle threw themselves on the king's mercy,
safety being granted to life and limb. Immediately upon
this, the king departed thence with his army towards Frem-
ingham, 31 the castle of earl Hugh Bigot ; where the earl
himself was, with a large body of Flemings. The king, on
drawing nigh to Fremingham, encamped at a place which is
called Seleham, and remained there that night. On the follow-
ing day, earl Hugh Bigot came to him, and, making a treaty of
peace with him, surrendered to him the castle of Fremingham,
and the castle of Bungay, and with considerable difficulty ob-
tained the king's permission that the Flemings who were with
him might without molestation return home. At this place,
the horse of Tostes de Saint Omer, a knight of the Temple,
struck the king on the leg, and injured him considerably. On
the following day, namely, on the seventh day before the
calends of August, the king departed from Seleham, and pro-
ceeded to Northampton ; on his arrival at which place William,
king of the Scots, was brought to him, with his feet fast-
ened beneath a horse's belly. There also came to him Hugh,
bishop of Durham, who delivered to him possession of the
castle of Durham, the castle of Norham, and the new castle
of Alverton, which he had fortified, and, after considerable
difficulty, obtained permission that his nephew, the count de
Bar, and the knights who had come with him, might return to
their own country. Roger de Mowbray also came thither to
him, and surrendered to him the castle of Tresk, 32 and the
earl of Ferrers delivered up to him the castles of Tutesbury, 33
and of Duffield; Anketill Mallory also and William de Dive,
constables of the earl of Leicester, surrendered to him the
castles of Leicester, of Mountsorrel, and of Groby.

Thus then, within the space of three weeks, was the whole
of England restored to tranquillity, and all its fortified places
delivered into the king's hands. These matters being arranged
to his satisfaction, he speedily crossed over from England
to Normandy, and landed at Barbeflet on the sixth day
before the ides of August, being the fifth day of the week,

taking with him his Brabanters and a thousand "Welchmen,
together with "William, king of the Scots, Robert, earl of
Leicester, and Hugh, earl of Chester, whom he placed in con-
finement, first at Caen, and afterwards at Falaise.

On the same day on which the king landed at Barbeflet, he
met on the sea -shore Richard, archbishop of Canterbury, on
his return from Alexander, the Supreme Pontiff, with the pall
and legateship and primacy of the whole of England, together
with Reginald, bishop of Bath, whom the said archbishop
had consecrated at Saint John de Maurienne, on their re-
turn from Rome. The king, however, did not wish to de-
tain them with him, but sent them on to England. After
this, on the Lord's day next ensuing, the king, the father, arrived
with his Brabanters and Welchmen at Rouen, which the king
of France and the king of England, the son, were besieging
on one side, while on the other there was free egress and
ingress. On the following morning, the king sent his Welch-
men beyond the river Seine ; who, making way by main force,
broke through the midst of the camp of the king of France,
and arrived unhurt at the great forest, and on the same day
slew more than a hundred of the men of the king of France.

Now, the king of France had been staying there hardly a
month, when, lo ! the king of England, the father, coming from
England, opened the gates of the city, which the burgesses had
blocked up, and sallying forth with his knights and men-at-
arms, caused the fosses which had been made between the army
of the king of France and the city, to be filled up with logs of
timber, stones, and earth, and to be thus made level. As for
the king of France, he and his men remained in their tents,
and were not inclined to come forth. The rest of the peo-
ple of the king of England took up their positions for the
defence of the walls, but no one attacked them ; however, a
part of the army of the king of France made an attempt to
destroy their own engines of war.

On the following day, early in the morning, the king of
France sent the weaker portion of his army into his own terri-
tories ; and, with the permission of the king of England, fol-
lowed them on the same day to a place which is called Mal-
aunay, and lies between Rouen and the town called Tostes ;
having first given security by the hand of "William, arch-
bishop of Sens, and of earl Theobald, that on the following day



A. D. 1174. CONFEEENCE BETWEEN HENEY AND HIS SONS. 385

he would return to confer with the king of England on making
peace between him and his sons. The king of France, how-
ever, did not keep his engagement and his oath, and did not
come on the following day to the conference, hut departed into
his own territories.

However, after the expiration of a few days, he again sent
the above-named archbishop of Sens and earl Theobald to the
king of England, appointing a day for the conference, to be
held at Gisors, on the Nativity of Saint Mary. When they met
there they could not come to an agreement, on account of
Richard, earl of Poitou, who was at this time in Poitou, be-
sieging the castles and subjects of his father. In consequence
of this, they again held another conference between them, upon
the festival of Saint Michael, between Tours and Amboise,
on which occasion they agreed to a truce on these terms :
that the said Richard, earl of Poitou, should be excluded from
all benefit of the truce, and that the king of France and the
king of England, the son, should give him no succour what-
ever. Upon these arrangements being made on either side,
the king of England, the father, moved on his army into
Poitou ; on which, Richard, earl of Poitou, his son, not daring
to await his approach, fled from place to place. When he
afterwards came to understand that the king of France, and
the king, his brother, had excluded him from the benefit of
the truce, he was greatly indignant thereat; and, coming
with tears, he fell on his face upon the ground at the feet of his
father, and imploring pardon, was received into his father's
bosom. These events took place at Poitou, on the eleventh day
before the calends of October, being the second day of the
week ; and thus, the king and his son Richard becoming re-
j2onciled, they entered the city of Poitou.

After this, they both set out together for a conference held
between Tours and Amboise, on the day before the calends of
October, being the second day of the week and the day after
the feast of Saint Michael. Here the king, the son, and
Richard and Geoffrey, his brothers, by the advice and consent
of the king and barons of France, made the treaty of peace
underwritten with the king their father :

"Be it known unto all present as well as to come, that, by
the will of God, peace has been made between our lord the
king and his sons, Henry, Richard, and Geoffrey, on the

VOL. i. c c



S86 A2TXAL3 OF ROGEB DE HOVEDEtf. A.D. 1174.

following terms : Henry, the king, the son of the king, and
his brothers aforesaid, have returned unto their father and to
his service as their liege lord, free and absolved from all oaths
whatsoever which they have made between themselves, or
with any other persons, against him, or against his subjects.
All liegemen and barons who, for their sake, have abandoned
their fealty to their father, they have released from all oaths
whatsoever which they have made to themselves ; and, freely
acquitted from all oaths and absolved from all covenants which
they had made to them, the same have returned to their
homage and allegiance to our lord the king. Also, our lord
the king, and all his liegemen and barons, are to receive pos-
session of all their lands and castles which they held fifteen
days before his sons withdrew from him. So, in like manner,
his liegemen and barons who Avithdrew from him and followed
his sons, are to receive possession of their lands which they
had fifteen days before they withdrew from him. Also, our
lord the king has laid aside all displeasure against his barons
and liegemen who withdrew from him, so that by reason
thereof he will do no evil to them, so long as they shall faith-
fully serve him as their liege lord. And, in like manner, the
king, his son, has pardoned all, both clerks as well as laymen,
who took part with his father, and has remitted all displeasure
against them, and has given security into the hand of our lord
the king, his father, that he will not do, or seek to do, in all his
life any evil or harm to those who obeyed him, by reason of
their so doing. Also, upon these conditions, the king gives
to the king, his son, two suitable castles in Normandy, at
the option of his father, and fifteen thousand pounds, Anjouin,
yearly revenue. Also, to his son Kichard he gives two suitable
mansions in Poitou, whence evil cannot ensue to the king,
and a moiety of the revenues of Poitou in ready money. To
his son Geoffrey he gives, in ready money, the moiety of
what he would receive in Brittany on his marriage with the
daughter of earl Conan, whom he is to take to wife ; and after,
by the license of the Roman Church, he shall have taken
her to wife, then he shall have the whole of the revenues
accruing by that marriage, in such manner as is set forth in
the deed executed by earl Conan. But, as to the prisoners
who have made a composition with our lord the king before
this treaty was made with our lord the king, namely, the



A.D. 1174. TEEATY OF PEACE BETWEEN HENEY iND HIS SONS. 387

king of Scotland, the earl of Leicester, the earl of Chester,
and Ralph de Fougeres, and their pledges, and the pledges of
the other prisoners whom he had hefore that time, they are to
be excepted out of this treaty. The other prisoners are, how-
ever, to be set at liberty on both sides ; but upon the under-
standing, that our lord the king shall take hostages as pledges
from such of his prisoners as he shall think fit, and as shall be
able to give the same; and from the rest he shall take security
by the assurance and oaths of themselves and of their friends.
As for the castles which have been built or fortified in the
territories of our lord the king since the war began, they
are, subject to the king's wishes thereon, to be reduced to the
same state in which they were fifteen days before the war
began. Further, be it known, that king Henry, the son, has
covenanted with our lord the king, his father, that he will
strictly observe all gifts in almoign which he has given, or
shall give, out of his lands, and the gifts of lands which
he has given, or shall give, to his liegemen for their services.
He has also covenanted that he will strictly and inviolably
confirm the gifts which the king, his father, has made to his
brother John ; namely, a thousand pounds of yearly revenues
out of his demesne lands and escheats in England at his own
option, together with their appurtenances ; also the castle of
Nottingham with the county thereof, and the castle of Marl-
borough with its appurtenances ; also, in Normandy, one thou-
sand pounds, Anjouin, of yearly revenue, and two castles in
Normandy at the option of his father ; and in Anjou and
the lands which belonged to the earl of Anjou, one thousand
pounds, Anjouin, of revenue, as also one castle in Anjou, one
castle in Touraine, and one castle in Maine. It has also been
covenanted by our lord the king, in the love which he bears
to his son, that all those who withdrew from him after his
son, and offended him by such withdrawal, may return into
the territories of our lord the king under his protection.
Also, for the chattels which on such withdrawal they carried
away, they shall not be answerable : as to murder, or treason,
or the maiming of any limb, they are to be answerable accord-
ing to the laws and customs of the land. Also, as to those who
before the war took to flight for any cause, and then entered
the service of his son, the same may, from the love he bears to
his son, return in peace, if they give pledge and surety that they

will abide their trial for those offences of which, before the
war, they have been guilty. Those, also, who were awaiting
trial at the time when they withdrew to his son, are to return
in peace, upon condition that their trials are to be in the same
state as when they withdrew. Henry, the king, the son of
our lord the king, has given security into the hands of his
father that this agreement shall on his part be strictly ob-
served. And, further, Henry, the king's son, and his brothers,
have given security that they will never demand of our lord
the king, contrary to the will and good pleasure of our lord
the king, their father, anything whatever beyond the gifts
above-written and agreed upon, and that they will withdraw
neither themselves nor their services from their father. Also,
Richard, and Geoffrey, his brother, have done homage to their
father for those things which he has given and granted unto
them ; and, whereas his son, Henry, was ready and willing
to do homage to him, our lord the king was unwilling to
receive the same of him, because he was a king ; but he has
received security from him for the same."

In the same year, a dissension arose between Uctred and
Gilbert, the sons of Fergus, and chieftains of the men of Gallo-
way, on which Malcolm, the son of Gilbert, took Uctred by
treachery, and, after depriving him of his virility and putting
out his eyes, caused him to be put to death.

In this year, also, Richard, archbishop of Canterbury, con-
secrated, in England, at Canterbury, Richard, bishop of Win-
chester, Robert Folliot, bishop of Hereford, Geoffrey Riddel,
bishop of Ely, and John, bishop of Chichester. In the same
year, nearly the whole of the city of Canterbury was burned to
the ground, together with the metropolitan church of the Holy
Trinity. In this year, also, died William Turbe, bishop of
Norwich.

In the same year, peace and final reconciliation were es-
tablished between Roger, archbishop of York, and Hugh, bishop
of Durham, upon the following terms : " The chapel and burial-
ground of Alverton shall remain in the hands of the prior of
Hexham, on condition that the archbishop shall not insist on any
person being buried there, nor shall the bishop hinder it. The
church of Hexham shall receive the chrism and oil from the
bishop of Durham, according to its present usage : the prior
of Hexham shall also attend the synod of Durham. The






A.E. 1174. TREATY BETWEEN THE SEES OF YORK AND DURHAM. 389

clerks and canons of Hexham shall receive ordination from
the bishop of Durham. The parishioners of Hexham, at the
time of Pentecost, if they shall think fit, shall visit the church
of Durham without any compulsion on the part of the hishop
or of his people, and without any prohibition on the part of the
archbishop or of his people. Also, if their people shall presume
to act contrary to this, their masters themselves shall correct
them. The prior of Hexham shall try all ecclesiastical causes of
that parish, without power to inflict fines, though with liberty
to impose penance. On the decease of the present prior, Ri-
chard, the bishop of Durham, shall have the same authority in
the appointing of another prior, which the said prior, Richard,
and the prior of Gisburne, and Peter, brother of the prior of
Bridlington, have sworn that the church of Durham had in
the appointing of the said prior, Richard, if indeed they shall
have sworn that it had any. The archbishop shall not demand
synodal fees of the churches of Saint Cuthbert, the names of
which, in the archdeaconry of Cleveland, are as follow : the
church of Hemmingburgh, the church of Schepwick, the church
of Alverton, the church of Bretteby, the church of Osmun-
derley, the church of Seigestun, the church of Lee, the church
of Oterington, the church of Crake, and the church of Holteby ;
in the archdeaconry of York ; the church of All Saints in
Ousegate, the church of Saint Peter the Little, and half
of the church of the Holy Trinity, in Sudersgate ; 34 and,
in the archdeaconry of the treasurer; the church of Hove-
den, 35 the church of Welleton, the church of Brentington,
and the church of Walkinton. But if the clergy of the said
churches, or the laity of the demesne manors of Saint Cuth-
bert, situate in Yorkshire, shall be guilty of anything that
deserves ecclesiastical correction, the same shall be amended
by the archbishop, such a summons being first issued, that
the bishop or his officer shall be able to be present thereat."
The above articles were confirmed by the archbishop and the
bishop, who mutually gave their word that they would, with-
out fraud or deceit, observe the same so long as they two should
live, and without prejudice to the church of either after the
decease of the other. In addition to which, the archbishop
similarly gave his word to the bishop that he would in no

matter annoy him or his church, or any one in his bishopric,
until the cause should have been first taken open cognizance
of in due course of judgment.

In the year of grace 1175, being the twenty-first year of
the reign of king Henry the Second, son of the empress Ma-
tilda, the said king was at Argenton, in Normandy, during the
festival of the Nativity of our Lord. At the Purification of
Saint Mary, he and the king, his son, were at Le Mans,
whence they returned into Normandy, and held a conference
with Louis, king of the Franks, at Gisors. Having come thence
to Bure in Normandy, the king, the son, in order that he might
remove all mistrust from his father's mind, did homage to him
as his liegeman, and swore fealty to him against all men, in the
presence of Rotrod, archbishop of Rouen, Henry, bishop of
Bayeux, William, earl of Mandeville, and Richard de Humez,
liis constable, and many other persons of the household of
both kings.

At the festival of Easter, the two kings were at Caesar's
Burgh, 36 and, after Easter, they proceeded to Caen to meet
Philip, earl of Flanders, who shortly before had assumed the
cross of the pilgrimage to Jerusalem. The king, the father,
prevailed upon him to release the king, the son, from all cove-
nants which he had made with him during the period of the
hostilities ; and the earl of Flanders delivered into the king's
hands the documents of the king, the son, which he had rela-
tive to the above-named covenants. On this, they confirmed
to the earl the yearly revenues which he had been in the habit of
receiving in England before the war.

The king, the father, also sent his son Richard into Poitou,
and his son Geoffrey into Brittany, with orders that the castles
which had been buUt or fortified during the time of the war,
should be reduced to the same state in which they were fifteen
days before the war began. After this, the king, the father,
and the king, the son, crossed over, and landed in England, at
Portsmouth, on the seventh day before the ides of May, being
the sixth day of the week. On coming to London, they found
Richard, archbishop of Canterbury, about to hold a synod at
Westminster on the Lord's day before the Ascension of our
Lord ; to which synod came nearly all the bishops and abbats
of the province of Canterbury. Before the kings above-named,

A.D. 1175. DECBEES OF THE SYNOD OF WESTMINSTER. 391

and the bishops and abbats, Richard, the archbishop of Can-
terbury, standing on an elevated place, published the decrees
underwritten :

" Synods are called together in. the Church of God, in con-
formity with the ancient usage of the fathers, in order that
those who are appointed to the higher office of the pastoral
charge, may, by institutions based upon rules subjected to their
common consideration, reform the lives of those submitted to
their care, and, with a judgment better informed, be able to
check those enormities which are incessantly springing up.
We therefore, rather adhering to-the rules of our forefathers who
adhered to the true faith, than devising anything new, have
thought it advisable that certain definite heads should be
published by us ; which by all of our province we do enjoin to be
strictly and inviolably observed. For all those who shall pre-
sume to contravene the enactments of this holy synod, we deem
to be transgressors of the sacred canons.

37 "If any priest or clerk in holy orders, having a church or
ecclesiastical benefice, shall publicly keep a harlot, and after
being warned thereon a first, second, and third time, shall not
put away his harlot, and entirely separate himself from her,
but shall rather think fit to persist in his uncleanness, he shall

J/be deprived of all ecclesiastical offices and benefices. But if any
persons below the rank of sub-deacons shall have contracted
marriage, let them not by any means be separated from their
wives, except with their common consent that they shall do so
and enter a religious order, and there let them with constancy
remain in the service of God. But if any persons of the rank
of sub-deacon or above the same, shall have contracted mar-
riage, let them leave their wives, even though they should be
unwilling and reluctant. Also, on the authority of the same

* epistle we have decreed, that the sons of priests are not, hence-
forth, to be instituted as clergymen in the churches of their
fathers ; nor are they, under any circumstances whatsoever,
to hold the same without the intervention of some third person.

38 " Clerks in holy orders are not to enter taverns for the pur-
pose of eating and drinking, nor to be present at public drinkings,
unless when travelling, and compelled by necessity. And it'

any one shall be guilty of so doing, either let him put an
end to the practice, or suffer deprivation.

39 "Those who are in holy orders are not allowed to give judg-
ment on matters of life and death. Wherefore, we do forbid
them either themselves to take part in dismemberment, or to
order it to be done by others. And if any one shall be guilty
of doing such a thing, let him be deprived of the office and
position of the orders that have been granted to him. We do
also forbid, under penalty of excommunication, any priest to
hold the office of sheriff, or that of any secular public officer. 40

41 " Clerks who allow their hair to grow, are, though against
their will, to be shorn by the archdeacon. They are also not
to be allowed to wear any garments or shoes, but such as are
consistent with propriety and religion. And if any one shall
presume to act contrary hereto, and on being warned shall
not be willing to reform, let him be subject to excommunica-
tion.

42 " Inasmuch as certain clerks, despairing of obtaining ordina-
tion from their own bishops, either on account of ignorance, or
irregularity of life, or the circumstances of their birth, or a
defect in their title, or youthful age, are ordained out of their
own province, and sometimes even by bishops beyond sea, or else
falsely assert that they have been so ordained, producing
unknown seals to their own bishops ; we do enact that the
ordination of such shall be deemed null and void, and, under
pain of excommunication, we do forbid that they shall be
employed by any one in the performance of his duties. The
bishop also, within our jurisdiction, who knowingly and wilfully
shall ordain any such person or employ him after the con-
ferring of such orders, 43 for so ordaining or employing him, let
him know that he is suspended from his office until he shall
have made due satisfaction. Likewise, inasmuch as the Church
of God, according to the verity of the Gospel, ought to be
the house of prayer, and not a den of thieves, and market
for blood; under pain of excommunication we do forbid 41

secular causes, in which the shedding of blood or bodily punish-
ment is likely to be the result, to be tried in churches or
in churchyards. For it is absurd and cruel for judgment of
bloodshed to be discussed in the place which has also been
appointed a place of refuge for the guilty.

45 "It has been told us, that it is the custom in some places for
money to be given for receiving the chrism, as also for baptism
and the communion. (This as a 46 simoniacal heresy a holy
council held in detestation, and visited with excommunication, i
We do therefore enact, that in future nothing shall be demanded
either for ordination, or for the chrism, or for baptism, or for ex-
treme unction, or for burial, or for the communion, or for dedi-
/ cation ; but the gifts of Christ are to be bestowed freely with
a gratuitous dispensation. If any person shall presume to act
in defiance hereof, let him be excommunicated.

47 " Let no prelate, on receiving a monk, or canon, or nun,
presume to take or demand money from those who come to adopt
the monastic life, under pretence of any agreement whatsoever.

48 " Let it be allowable for no one under the name of a
dowry to transfer a benefice to any person, or to exact money
or any emolument on the pretext of an agreement for the pre-
sentation of any person thereto. If he shall do so, and upon
trial shall confess or be convicted of the same, relying both on
our own and on the royal authority, we do enact that he shall
be for ever deprived of the patronage of the said church.

49 "According to the decreesof the fathers, we do, underpenalty

of excommunication, forbid that monks or clerks shall carry on

/ business for the sake of profit, and that monks shall hold farms

of the clergy or of the laity, or that the laity shall hold the

benefices of the Church to farm.

so "Whoever would appear to belong to the clergy, let them '
not take up arms, nor yet go about in armour ; but by their reli-
gious habits, let them reconcile the name of their profession to
the religious character of their manners. If they despise this
injunction, then, as contemners of the holy canons and pro-
faners of the ecclesiastical authority, let them be mulcted with
the loss of their proper rank : inasmuch as they cannot servj
both God and the world.

51 "Also, with regard to vicars, who on their promise and oath
are bound to their parsons, we have thought proper to enact,
that if, despising their promise or the obligation of their oath,
they shall falsely take upon themselves the character of parson,
and set themselves up against their parsons, and if they shall
upon trial confess thereto or be convicted thereof, then for the
future they are not to be admitted in the same bishopric to the
discharge of the duties of their office.

52 "All tithes of the land, whether of corn or of fruit, are the
Lord's, and are sanctified unto Him. But, inasmuch as many
are found unwilling to give tithes, we do enact, that according
to the commands of our lord the pope, they shall be ad-
monished a first, second, and third time, to give tithes in full
of corn, wine, fruits of trees, young of animals, wool, lambs,
butter, cheese, flax, hemp, and other things which are renewed
yearly ; and if, upon being admonished, they do not make
amends, let them understand that they are subject to excom-
munication.

"And further, let the imperial sanction put a check upon liti-
gation, and the audacity of those who inconsiderately appeal to
law, by condemning them to pay the costs, and various other
remedies. And inasmuch as this is known to be in unison
with the holy institutions, we do order, that for the future, in
such actions for the recovery of money as shall be tried among
clerks, the party who is the loser shall be condemned to pay
costs to his opponent. As for him who shall not be able to
make such payment, I leave him to be punished at the discre-
tion of his bishop.

rally called "Dominica in Albis," the word " depositis" being under-
stood ; as on that day, according to the Roman ritual, those lately bap-
tized laid aside the white garments which they had assumed on the
Sunday before Easter.

1 This preface, according to the Roman ritual, is read from Holy Satur-
day until the Ascension ; it begins, " It is truly meet and just, right and
available to salvation to praise thee, Lord."

nion. For we do not read that Christ gave the bread to the
others, having first dipped it, but only to that one of the dis-
ciples, whom the sop, when dipped, was to show to be his
betrayer, and not that it formed any characteristic of the in-
stitution of this Sacrament.

* 7 " We do command that the Eucharist shall not be consecrat-
ed in any other than a chalice of gold or silver, and from hence-
forth we do forbid any bishop to bless a chalice of pewter.

58 " Let no one of the faithful, of what rank soever, be married
in secret, but, receiving the benediction from the priest, let him
be publicly married in the Lord. Therefore, if any priest
shall be found to have united any persons in secret, let him be
suspended from the duties of his office for the space of three
years.

59 tt Where there is not the consent of both parties, it is not a
marriage ; therefore, those who give female children in the
cradle to male infants effect nothing thereby, unless both of
the children shall agree thereto after they have arrived at the
years of discretion. On the authority therefore of this decree,
we do forbid that in future any persons shall be united in mar-
riage, of whom either the one or the other shall not have
arrived at the age appointed by the laws, and set forth by the
canons, unless it shall at any time chance to happen that by
reason of some urgent necessity, a union of such a nature ought
to be tolerated for the sake of peace."

In this synod, also the clerks of Koger, archbishop of York,
asserted the right of the church of York to carry the cross in
the province of Canterbury. They also asserted, on the same
occasion, on behalf of the archbishop of York, that the bishopric
of Lincoln, the bishopric of Chester, the bishopric of Worces-
ter, and the bishopric of Hereford, ought by right to belong to
the metropolitan church of York ; and they summoned the
said archbishop of Canterbury on this question to the pre-
sence of the Roman Pontiff. They also summoned the arch-
bishop of Canterbury before the Roman Pontiff, for the alleged
injustice of the sentence of excommunication which he had
pronounced against the clergy of the archbishop of York, who,
with his sanction, officiated in the church of Saint Oswald, at
Gloucester, because they had refused to come to him upon his

summons in the same manner as the clergy of his own pro-
vince did.

At this synod also, the clergy of the church of Saint Asaph
requested the archbishop of Canterbury, that by virtue of the
obedience due to him, he would order Godfrey, bishop of the
church of Saint Asaph, to return to that see, with the ponti-
fical dignity of which he was invested, or else that the above-
named archbishop would appoint another bishop in his place.
For this Godfrey had left his bishopric, being compelled so to
do by poverty, and the hostile invasions of the Welch ; and
coming into England, had been kindly and honorably received
by the most Christian king Henry ; who also gave the vacant
abbacy of Abingdon into his charge, until such time as he
should be at liberty to return to his own see.

In consequence of this application, the said archbishop of
Canterbury, at the instance of the before-named clergy, and
by the advice of Alexander, the Supreme Pontiff, as also by
the counsel of his venerable brother bishops, at this synod,
called upon the said Godfrey, in virtue of his obedience, either
to return to his own see, or else freely and absolutely to
deliver up the pastoral care which had been placed in his
hands.

Upon this, Godfrey, being in hopes that the abbacy of Abing-
don, which had been delivered into his charge, would remain in
his hands, no one compelling him so to do, resigned his bishop-
ric into the hands of the archbishop of Canterbury, freely and
absolutely delivering up to him the ring and pastoral staff.
And so, being deceived, he lost them both ; for the king gave
the bishopric of Saint Asaph to Master Ada, a Welchman, and
the abbacy of Abingdon to a certain monk.

6 Robert, earl of Gloucester, at tliis period surrendered to the
ng of England the castle of Bristol, of which the king had
never before been able to gain possession. In the same year,
on the octave of the Nativity of Saint John the Baptist, both,
the kings came to Woodstock, and were met there by Richard,
archbishop of Canterbury, Richard, bishop of Winchester,
Reginald, bishop of Bath, Jocelyn, bishop of Salisbury, Roger,
bishop of Worcester, Geoffrey, bishop of Ely, John, bishop of
Chichester, Walter, bishop of Rochester, Bartholomew, bishop
of Exeter, and Hugh, bishop of Durham, who had come
thither on business of their own. There also came thither all

the abbats of the province of Canterbury ; and they held a
great synod on the election of a pastor to the pontifical see of
the church of Norwich, and on the election of pastors to the
abbeys which were then vacant throughout England ; namely,
the abbey of Grimsby, the abbey of Croyland, the abbey of
Thorney, the abbey of Westminster, the abbey of Saint Augus-
tine, at Canterbury, the abbey of Battle, the abbey of Hyde
at Winchester, the abbey of Abingdon, the abbey of Abbots-
bury, and the abbey of Michelney. 60 John of Oxford, the king's
clerk, was elected to the bishopric of Norwich, and was con-
secrated by Richard, archbishop of Canterbury. The abbeys
before-mentioned were also distributed among religious men,
as seemed good to our lord the king and the above-named
archbishop.

In the same year, pope Alexander confirmed the election of
Geoffrey, bishop elect of Lincoln. In this year, also, the king,
the father, impleaded all the clergy and laity of his kingdom
who, in the time of the wars, had committed offences against
him in his forests, and as to the taking of venison, and ex-
acted fines of them all, although Richard de Lucy gave a war-
ranty that all this was done with his sanction, and by command
of the king, sent from beyond sea.

After this, the two kings proceeded to Tork, where they
were met by William, king of the Scots, and his brother
David, together with nearly the whole of the bishops and
abbats, and other principal men of his dominions. And at
this place was renewed the treaty and final reconciliation which
the said king of Scotland had made with his lord the king of
England, the father, at Falaise, while he was his prisoner, in
presence of the king, his son, Roger, archbishop of York,
Hugh, bishop of Durham, and the earls and barons of Eng-
land, as also of the bishops and abbats, earls and barons of
the kingdom of Scotland. This charter of confirmation thereof
was read to the following effect in the church of Saint Peter,
at York :

" William, king of Scotland, becomes the liegeman of our lord
the king, against all the men of Scotland and for all the rest
of his dominions ; and has done fealty to him as his liege lord,
in the same manner in which other men, his own liegemen, are
wont to do unto himself. In like manner he has done homage
60 In Somersetshire.



A.D. 1175. SrBMISSIOX OF THE KIITG OP SCOTLAND. 399

to king Henry, his son, saving always his fealty to our lord
the king, his lather.

" All the bishops, abbats, and clergy of the king's territory
of Scotland, as also their successors, shall do fealty to our lord
the king as their liege lord, according to his pleasure, and to
his son, king Henry, and their heirs, in such manner as his
other bishops are wont to do unto him.

" Also, the king of Scotland, and David, his brother, and
the barons and the rest of his subjects, have agreed that the
Church of Scotland shall from henceforth pay such obedience to
the Church of England as it ought in duty to pay, and was wont
to pay in the times of the kings of England, his predecessors.

" In like manner Richard, bishop of Saint Andrews, Richard,
bishop of Dunkeld, Geoffrey, abbat of Dunfermline, and Her-
bert, prior of Coldingham, have agreed that the Church of
England shall again have that authority over the Church of
Scotland which of right it ought to have, and that they will not
oppose the rights of the Church of England. And they have
given security as to this agreement, in. that they have as lieges
done fealty to our lord the king and to his son Henry.

" The same shall be done by the rest of the bishops and the
clergy of Scotland, according to the covenants made between our
lord the king and the king of Scotland, and his brother David
and his barons. The earls also, and barons and other subjects
of the kingdom of the king of Scotland, from whom our lord
the king shall wish to receive the same, shall do homage to
him against all men and fealty as their liege lord, in such
manner as his other subjects are wont to do, as also to his son
king Henry and his heirs, saving always their fealty to our
lord the king, his father. In like manner the heirs of the
king of Scotland and of his barons and of his subjects shall do
nomage and allegiance to the heirs of our lord the king against
all men.

" Further, from henceforth the king of Scotland and his sub-
jects shall harbour no fugitive from the territories of our lord the
king by reason of felony, either in Scotland or in any other of
his territories, unless he shall be willing forthwith to take his
trial in the court of our lord the king and to abide by the judg-
ment of the court. But the king of Scotland and his men shall
arrest him with all possible speed, and shall deliver him up to
our lord the king, or to his justiciaries or bailiffs in England.



400 ATHfALS OF ROGER DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1175.

" And if any fugitive from the territories of the king of Scot-
land, by reason of felony, shall be in England, unless he shall
be willing to take his trial in the court of the king of
Scotland, and abide by the judgment of the court, he shall not
be harboured in the lands of the king, but shall be delivered
unto the men of the king of Scotland, when he shall have
been found by the bailiffs of our lord the king.

" Further, the men of our lord the king shall hold their
lands which they have held and ought to hold, against our lord
the king and his men, and against the king of Scotland and his
men. And the men of the king of Scotland shall hold their
lands which they have held and ought to hold, against our lord
the king and his men.

" By way of security for the strict observance of the said
covenants and final agreement so made with our lord the king
and his son Henry and their heirs, on part of the king of
Scotland and his heirs, the king of Scotland has delivered
unto our lord the king the castle of Eoxburgh, the castle
of Berwick, the castle of Geddewerde, 61 the castle of the
Maidens, 62 and the castle of Striveline, 63 unto the mercy of
our lord the king. In addition to which, for the purpose of
ensuring the performance of the said covenants and final
agreement, the king of Scotland has delivered unto our lord
the king his brother David as a hostage, as also earl Dunecan,
earl Waltheof, earl Gilbert, the earl of Angus, Eichard de
Morville, his constable, Nes Fitzwilliam, Eichard Cumin,
Walter Corbet, Walter Olifard, 64 John de Vals, William de
Lindesey, Philip de Colville, Philip de Baluines, Eobert Fren-
bert, Eobert de Burneville, Hugh Giffard, Hugh Eiddel, Walter
de Berkeley, William de la Haie, and William de Mortimer.
But when the castles shall have been delivered up, William,
king of Scotland, and his brother David shall be set at liberty.
The earls and barons above-named shall, after each of them
shall have delivered up his hostage, namely, a lawful son,
those who have one, and the rest their nephews or next heirs,
and after the castles, as above-mentioned, shall have been sur-
rendered, be set at liberty.

"Further, the king of Scotland and his before-named barons

have pledged their word that with good faith and without evil
, intent, and with no excuse whatever, they will cause the
bishops and barons and other men of their land who were not
present when the king of Scotland made this treaty with our
lord the king, to make the same allegiance and fealty to
our lord the king and to his son Henry, which they themselves
have made, and, like the barons and men who were here
present, to deliver as hostages to our lord the king whomso-
ever he shall think fit.

" Further, the bishops, earls, and barons have agreed with our
lord the king and his son Henry, -that if the king of Scotland,
by any chance, shall withdraw from his fealty to our lord the
king and to his son, and from the aforesaid covenants, in such
case they will hold with our lord the king, as with their liege
lord, against the king of Scotland, and against all men at
enmity with the king; and they will place the dominions
of the king of Scotland under interdict, until he shall return
to his fealty to our lord the king.

"That the covenants aforesaid shall be strictly observed, and
in good faith, and without evil intent, by William, king of
Scotland and David his brother, and by his barons above-
named, and their heirs, the king of Scotland himself, and David
his brother, and all his said barons, have pledged themselves
as liegemen of our lord the king against all men, as also of his
son Henry, saving their fealty to his father ; the following
being witnesses hereto : Richard, bishop of Avranches, John,
dean of Salisbury, Robert, abbat of Malmesbury, Ralph, abbat
of Mundeburg, Herbert, archdeacon of Northampton, "Walter
de Coutances, Roger, the king's chaplain, Osbert, clerk of the
chamber, Richard, son of our lord the king, earl of Poitou,
Geoffrey, son of our lord the king, earl of Brittany, William,
%arl of Essex, Hugh, earl of Chester, Richard de Humezt,
constable and earl of Mellent, Jordan Thessun, Humphrey
de Bohun, William de Courcy, seneschal, and Gilbert Malet,
seneschal of Falaise."

The aforesaid having been recited in the church of Saint
Peter, at York, in the presence of the before-named kings of
England [and Scotland], 65 and of David, brother of the king of
Scotland, and of the whole of the people, the bishops, earls,
barons, and knights of the territories of the king of Scotland,

swore fealty to our lord, the king of England, and to his son
Henry and his heirs, as their liege lords against all men.

In the meantime, Philip, earl of Flanders, took prisoner a
knight named "Walter de Fontaines, one sprung of a noble
family, and conspicuous before all his compeers in feats of
arms ; making a charge against him that he had unlawfully
known the countess of Flanders. On this, the said "Walter,
intending to make denial thereof, offered to prove his inno-
cence in any way whatever, affirming that he had never known
the countess, nor had ever had it in his thoughts to know her.
The earl, however, would not allow him so to clear himself ;
but in the fury of his wrath gave orders that he should be put
to death by being beaten with clubs. Accordingly, the execu-
tioners seized him, and, binding him hand and foot, beat him
with clubs, and hung him up half dead by the feet, with his
head hanging downwards in a filthy sewer, and thus, being
suffocated by the stench from the sewer, he ended his life
most shockingly.

Upon this, JElismus and the other sons of the before-named
Walter de Fontaines, and Jacques de Avennes, and the rest of
their relations, 'fortifying their castles, rose in rebellion against
the earl, and laid waste his lands with fire and sword ; and
thus at length compelled him to give them satisfaction for the
death of the said Walter de Fontaines.

In the same year, Richard, earl of Poitou, son of Henry, king
of England, laid siege to Chatillon, beyond Agens, which
Arnold de Boiville had fortified against him, and refused to
surrender. Accordingly, having arranged there his engines
of war, within two months he took it, together with thirty
knights, and retained it in his own hands.

In the same year king Henry, the father, held a great council
at Windsor, on the octave of the feast of Saint Michael, the
king, his son, Richard, archbishop of Canterbury, and the
bishops of England being present, and in presence of Laurence,
archbishop of Dublin, and the earls and barons of England.
At this council the Catholic archbishop of Tuam, Cantordis,
abbat of Saint Brandan, and master Laurence, chancellor of
Roderic, king of Connaught, made the underwritten final treaty
and agreement with our lord the king, the father, on behalf
of Roderic, king of Connaught :

" This is the final treaty and agreement made at Windsor on



A.D. 1175. TBEATY BETWEEN KING EODEEIC AND KING HENBY. 403

the octave of Saint Michael, in the year of grace one thousand
one hundred and seventy-five, between our lord the king of
England, Henry, son of the empress Matilda, and Eoderic, king
of Connaught, by the Catholic archbishop of Tuam, Cantordis,
abbat of Saint Brandan, and master Laurence, chancellor of the
king of Connaught ; that is to say

" The king of England grants to the above-named Eoderic,
his liegeman, the kingdom of Connaught, so long as he shall
faithfully serve him, so as to be king thereof under him and
ready to do him service as his liegeman, that he shall hold
his lands as well and as peaceably as he held the same be-
fore our lord the king of England entered Ireland, always
paying him tribute, and that he shall hold all the rest of that
land and the inhabitants of that land in subjection to himself,
and shall exercise justice over them in such way that they
shall pay full tribute to the king of England, and by his hand
preserve their rights. And those who now hold lands, are to
hold the same in peace so long as they shall observe their
fealty to the king of England, and fully and faithfully render
tribute and his other rights which they owe to him by the
hand of the king of Connaught, saving in all things the rights
and honor of our lord the king of England and of himself.

" And if any of them shall become rebels against the king of
England and himself, and shall be unwilling by his hand to
render tribute and his other rights unto the king of England,
and shall withdraw from their fealty to the king ; he shall take
judicial cognizance of them, and remove them therefrom.
And if of himself he shall not be able to carry out his sentence
upon them, the constable of the king of England and his
household in that land shall aid him in so doing, when they
shall have been called upon by him, and shall themselves see
that it is necessary so to do. And by reason of this treaty, the
aforesaid king of Connaught shall render tribute each year to
our lord the king, that is to say, for every ten animals one skin,
such as may be approved by dealers, both from the whole of
his own lands, as also from those of others.

" Except that, as to those lands which our lord the king has
retained as of his own demesne and as of the demesne of his
barons, he shall not make entry thereupon, that is to say, t)ub-
linwith its appurtenances, and Meath with all its appurte-
nances, as wholly and fully as ever the Marchat Vamaileth

Lachlin, or any who held it of him, held the same. Also, with
the further exception of Wexford, with all its appurtenances,
that is to say, with the whole of Leighlin : and with the ex-
ception of Waterford, with the whole of the land that lies be-
tween "Waterford and Dungarvan, so that Dungarvan with all
its appurtenances be included in the said land.

" And if the Irish who have taken to flight shall wish to re-
turn to the lands of the barons of the king of England, they
are to return in peace on paying the above-named tribute which
others pay, or doing the ancient services which they were in
the habit of doing for their lands ; this latter to be at the will
and option of the lords. And if any of them shall refuse to re-
turn to their lord the king of Connaught, he is to compel them
to return to their lands, that they may remain there under his
protection, and the king of Connaught is to receive hostages from
all whom our lord the king of England has entrusted to him,
at the will of our lord the king and of himself. He himself
also shall give hostages at the will of our lord the king of
England, of one sort or another, and they shall do service unto
our lord the king each year with their dogs and birds, by way
of making payment. And nothing whatever, on any land
whatsoever belonging to our lord the king shall they withhold
against the will and command of our lord the king. Wit-
nesses hereto : Richard, bishop of Winchester, Geoffrey, bishop
of Ely, Laurence, archbishop of Dublin, Geoffrey, Nicholas,
and Roger, the king's chaplains, William, earl of Essex, Richard
de Lucy, Geoffrey de Perche, Reginald de Cor tinea," and many
others.

At the same council the king of England gave the bishopric
of Waterford to Master Augustin, a native of Ireland, that
see being then vacant there, and he sent him into Ireland
with Laurence, archbishop of Dublin, to be consecrated by
Donatus, archbishop of Cashel. In the same year, there was in
England, and in the countries adjoining, a deadly mortality
among mankind, so milch so, that on most days seven or eight
bodies of the dead were carried out to burial. And immedi-
ately after this deadly mortality, a dreadful famine ensued.

In the same year, a short time before the feast of All Saints,
there came to England a cardinal, whose name was Huge-
zun, 66 a legate from the Apostolic See, for whom our lord the

67 He is more generally called Hugo de Petril Leonis. See p. 406.



A.D. 1175. DEPBIVATION OF WILLIAM DE WALTERVILLE. 405

king had sent to Eome. He found our lord, the king, staying
at Winchester, on which, the king went forth to meet him,
his son Henry being with him, and they received him with all
becoming honor. Our lord, the king, prolonging his stay
for some days at Winchester, treated, at very great length, on
the restoration of peace between Roger, the archbishop of
York, and Richard, the archbishop of Canterbury, the chapel
of Saint Oswald at Gloucester, and the carrying of the cross
of the archbishop of York.

At length, by the management of the king, an arrangement
was made between the above-named archbishops to the fol-
lowing effect. The archbishop of Canterbury released and ac-
quitted to the archbishop of York the chapel of Saint Oswald,
at Gloucester, from all jurisdiction on his part, as though it
were a private chapel belonging to our lord the king. He
also absolved the clerks of the archbishop of York, whom he
had excommunicated ; and as to the carrying of the cross, and
the other disputes which existed between their churches, they
agreed to abide by the decision of the archbishop of Rouen and
other neighbouring bishops of the kingdom of France. And
upon this, they were to keep the peace between them for the
space of five years ; upon condition that neither of them should
seek to do any harm or injury to the other until the said con-
troversy should have been settled, and brought to a due con-
clusion by the above-named archbishop and the other bishops.
Also, the above-named cardinal, Hugezun, gave to our lord,
the king, permission to implead the clergy of his kingdom for
offences against his forests and taking venison therein.

In the same year, Richard, archbishop of Canterbury, de-
prived William de Walterville, abbat of Saint Peter de Burgh, 68
f because he had broken into the cloisters of his abbey, and
attempted to carry off with a violent and armed band of men
the relics of the Saints, together with an arm of Saint Oswald,
the king and Martyr ; in the defence of which, some of the
monks and servants of the church were wounded, and others
slain. However, the chief and especial cause of this de-
privation was, that our lord the king hated him on account
of his brother Walter de Walterville, whom, together with
other enemies of the king, he had harboured during the time
of the hostilities. In the same year, died Reginald, earl of

68 Peterborough.

the festival of the Nativity of our Lord. On the same day,
the before-named cardinal deacon, Hugezun, titular of Saint

there held a great council, 69 on the statutes of his realm, and
in the presence of the king, his son, and of the archbishops,

After which, the king caused all the above-named justices
to swear upon the Holy Evangelists, that they would with good
faith, and without evil intent, observe these assizes under-
written, and cause them to be inviolably observed by the people
of his realm..

THE ASSIZES OF KING HEKRT.

First ordained at Clarendon, and re-enacted at Northampton.

" If any person shall be charged before the justices of our
lord the king, with murder, or larceny, or robbery, or the
harbouring of men guilty of the same, or coining,' 4 or arson,
then upon the oath of twelve knights of the hundred, and, if
there shall be no such knights, upon the oath of twelve free and
lawful men, and upon the oath of four men of each vill of the
hundred, he is to be tried by judgment of water, 75 and if he is

70 Shropshire. 71 Yorkshire.

71 Part of the present county of Northumberland.

73 The name of this celebrated lawyer was Ranulph, not Radulph or
Ralph.

74 The crime of " falsoneria" seems to have been that of coining, or of
using means to debase the currency.

water ; if he swam, he was considered guilty ; but if he sank, he was pro-
nounced innocent.

cast, he is to lose one foot. At Northampton it has been
added, to vindicate the rigour of justice, that in like manner
he is to lose his right hand, together with his foot, and to
abjure the realm, and be banished therefrom within the space
of forty days. But if he shall be acquitted on trial by water,
then let him find sureties and remain in the realm, unless
he shall again be charged with murder, or any base felony, by
the commons of the county and of the lawful knights of the
country : on which, if he shall be charged in manner aforesaid,
even though upon judgment by water he shall be acquitted,
nevertheless, within forty days, he is to depart from the realm,
and carry with him his chattels, saving always the right of his
superior lord, and, being at the mercy of our lord the king, he
is to abjure the realm. This assize shall hold good from the
time that the assize was made at Clarendon up to the present
. time, and from henceforth, so long as it shall seem good to our
lord the king, in cases of murder, treason, and arson, and in
all the matters aforesaid, with the exception of trifling thefts
and robberies, which took place in the time of the war, such
as of horses, cattle, and things of less consequence.

" It shall be lawful for no one, either in a borough or vill,
to entertain 76 in his house for more than one night any stranger
for whose forthcoming he shall be unwilling to give security,
unless he who is so entertained shall have some reasonable
essoign, 77 which the landlord of the house is to shew to his
neighbours, and when he departs he is to depart before the
neighbours, and in the daytime.

" If any person shall be arrested for murder, or for larceny,
or for robbery, or for coining, and shall make confession of the
same before the chief 78 of the hundred or borough, and be-
fore lawful men, or of any other felony which he has com-
mitted, he shall not be allowed afterwards before the justices to
make denial of the same. And if, without arrest, he shall
make confession before them of anything of this nature, of this
also he shall not be allowed before the justices to make denial.

"If any freeholder shall die, his heirs are to remain in such
seisin as their father had on the day on which he was living
and dead, both as to his fee and his chattels ; of which they

excuse by reason of sickness or infirmity. 78 Generally called the

are to make division according to the devise of the deceased,
and then to seek his lord and to pay him his relief 79 and other
things which they are bound to pay him out of their fee. And
if the heir shall happen to be under age, the lord of the fee is
to receive his homage and to keep him in his charge so long as
he is entitled ; and, if there are several lords, then let them
receive his homage, and let him do unto them what he is bound
to do. The wife also of the deceased is to have her dower and
the part of his chattels which belongs to her. And if the. lord
of the fee shall refuse to give seisin of the fee to the heirs of
the deceased at their demand, then the justices of our lord the
king are to cause a jury of twelve lawful men to be impannelled,
to enquire what seisin the deceased had in the same on the
day on which he was living and dead. And, according as
they shall find, so are they to make restitution to the heirs.
And if any person shall do the contrary of this, and be
attainted thereof, let him be amerced.

" The king's justices are to cause view to be made, by a jury,
of disseisins sur-assize that have been made since the period
when our lord the king came to England, shortly after peace
had been made between him and the king his son.

" The justices are to receive the oaths of fealty to our lord
the king before the close of Easter, 80 and at the latest before
the close of Pentecost, from all earls, barons, knights, and
freeholders, and from the serfs as well who shall wish to re-
main in the realm ; and he who shall refuse to do fealty, is to
be taken as an enemy to our lord the king. Also, the jus-
tices are to command all persons who have not yet done
homage and allegiance to our lord the king, to come to them
at a time which they shall appoint, and do homage to the king
and allegiance to him as their liege lord.

" The justices are to exercise all rights and jurisdictions that
belong to our lord the king and to his crown, by writ of our
lord the king, or of those who shall be in his place, as to fees
held by half-knight's service 81 and below it ; unless the question
be of such importance that it cannot be settled without the
presence of our lord the king, or of such a nature that the

justices shall refer it to him, or to those who shall be in his
place, in consequence of their doubts. Still, to the best of
their ability, they are to exert themselves to consult the con-
venience of our lord the king.

" Throughout those counties through which they are to go,
they are to hold assizes for the trial of wicked thieves and
evil-doers to the land ; the same being held by consent of the
king, and of his son, and of his subjects.

" Also, the justices are to take precaution that the castles
already dismantled are quite dismantled, and that those which
are to be dismantled are utterly razed to the ground. And, if
they do not, our lord the king will desire to have the judg-
ment of his court on them as contemners of his commands.

" The justices are to make enquiry as to escheats, and
churches, and lands, and female wards, 82 that are at the dis-
posal of our lord the king.

" The bailiffs of our lord the king are to be answerable in
the exchequer both for the rents of assize, and their other
levies which they make in their bailiwicks ; with the excep-
tion of those which relate to the shrievalty.

" The justices are to make enquiry as to the keepers 83 of the
[royal] castles, both who they are, and how much they owe,
and where ; and, after that, they are to report thereon to our
lord the king.

"A robber, immediately he is taken, is to be given into the
custody of the sheriff; and, if the sheriff is absent, then he
is to be taken to the nearest castellan, and let him take charge
of him until such time as he shall deliver him over to the
sheriff.

" The justices are to cause, according to the custom of the
country, enquiry to be made for those who have withdrawn
from the kingdom ; and, unless they are ready to return within
a time named, and to take their trial in the court of our lord
the king, they are to be outlawed ; and the names of those out-
lawed are to be brought at Easter and at the feast of Saint
Michael to the exchequer, and are to be sent immediately to
our lord the king."

AD. 1175. THE POPE'S ZEGATE HOLDS A COUNCIL. 411

To the aforesaid council held at Northampton, came Wil-
liam, king of the Scots, in obedience to the command of our
lord the king, bringing with him Kichard, bishop of Saint
Andrews, Jocelyn, bishop of Glasgow, Richard, bishop of
Dunkeld, Christian, bishop of Whitherne, Andrew, bishop of
Caithness, and Simon de Touy, bishop of Moray, together
with the other bishops, abbats, and priors of his kingdom.
When they had come before our lord the king of England, our
lord the king commanded, by the fealty which they owed
him, and the oath of fealty which they had made to him, that
they should show the same obedience to the Church of Eng-
land which they were in duty bound, and used to show, in the
times of the kings of England, his predecessors.

On this, they made answer to him that they never had paid
obedience to the Church of England, nor was it their duty so
to do; to which, Roger, archbishop of York, made reply, and
alleged that the bishops of Glasgow and the bishops of Whit-
herne had been subject to the church of York in the time of
the archbishops, his predecessors; and, relative thereto, he
satisfactorily pointed out the privileges granted by the Roman
Pontiffs. Jocelyn, bishop of Glasgow, made reply to these
assertions to the following effect : " The church of Glasgow is
in especial the daughter of the Church of Rome, and is exempt
from all subjection to either archbishops or bishops ; and, if
the church of York has at any time had authority over the
church of Glasgow, it is clear that, in future, she deserves to
hold no dominion whatsoever over her."

As Richard the archbishop of Canterbury was using his
best endeavours that the Church of Scotland might be ren-
dered subject to the church of Canterbury, he prevailed upon
the king of England to allow the bishops of Scotland to re-
turn to their own country without yielding any subjection to
the Church of England.

In the same year, at mid-Lent, the above-named Hugezun,
cardinal, titular of Saint Michael de Petra Leonis, and legate
of the Apostolic See, came to London to hold a council there.
Here he was met by the archbishops of Canterbury and York,
and all the bishops and abbats of England, with great num-
bers of the clergy. The said cardinal took his seat at West-
minster, in the chapel of the Infirm Monks, and the bishops
and abbats with him, each in his place, according to his rank



412 ANNALS OF BOGEB, DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1176,

and dignity. But a dispute arose between the archbishops of
Canterbury and York, which of them ought to sit on the
right hand of the cardinal ; and on the archbishop of York
attempting to seat himself there, 84 the servants of the lord
archbishop of Canterbury rushed upon him and threw him to
the ground, kicked him with their feet, and tore his hood.
Upon this, the people there assembled dispersed, and the cardinal
took to flight and hid himself from before their faces, and thus
was the council prevented from being held. But, after both
sides had made appeal to the Supreme Pontiff, each of them
complained to the king of the wrongs which he had suf-
fered.

In this year, the king, the father, was at Winchester during
the festival of Easter, and Richard, earl of Poitou, and Geof-
frey, earl of Brittany, with the permission of the king, their
father, crossed over from England to Normandy. Immediately
Richard, earl of Poitou, arrived in Poitou, he assembled a large
army, and fought a battle with the Brabanters, between Saint
Hegrin and Buteville, and routed them.

After this, he waged war against Aimeric, viscount de Li-
moges, because he had broken the peace with him. He
then laid siege to a castle which is called Aesse, and took
it, together with forty knights who formed its garrison.
After this, he laid siege to the city of Limoges, and took it,
and then proceeded to Poitou to meet the king, his brother,
who had come thither to aid him ; after which they laid siege
to Neufchatel, 86 and took it. After its capture, the king, his
brother, was unwilling to prolong his stay with him, but, listen-
ing to bad advice, took his departure. Richard, earl of Poitou,
however, now laid siege to Molineux, a castle of the viscount
of AngoulSme, and took it, and in it William Taillefer, count
of Angouleme, Buger, his son, and Aimeric, viscount of Li-
moges, the viscount of Ventadour, and the viscount of Cam-
banais. The count of Angouleme also delivered up to the earl
of Poitou the castle of Buteville, the castle of Archiac, the
castle of Montimac, the castle of Lachese, and the castle of
Melpis.

84 According to the account given by Gervaise he actually tried to seat
himself in the lap of the archbishop of Canterbury. The translation given
of it by Holinshed is highly amusing, but hardly suited to ears polite.

A.D. 1176. MAHRIAGE OF THE PRINCESS JOAKWA. 413

The king, the son, on his return, upon coming to Poitiers,
took Adam de Chirchedowne, his vice-chancellor, who was a
clerk of Geoffrey, the prior of Beverley, chancellor of the
king, the son, and caused him to be beaten with sticks, charg-
ing him with having disclosed his secret counsels to the king,
his father; and after being thus beaten, he had him led naked
through the streets of the city of Poitiers, while, being still
whipped, proclamation was made by the voice of a herald,
" Thus does he deserve to be disgraced who reveals the secrets
of his master."

In the same year, there came to England, from "William,
king of Sicily, the bishop of Troia, the archbishop elect of
Capua, and count Florio, as envoys to Henry, king of Eng-
land, the father, and asked of him his daughter Joanna in
marriage for "William, king of Sicily, their .master. A council
upon the matter being accordingly held in London, the king,
the father, with the consent of all the bishops, earls, and
barons of the kingdom, gave his daughter to the king of
Sicily. And with this assent, the king first sent to the king
of Sicily the bishop of Troia, John, bishop of Norwich, Paris,
archdeacon of Rochester, Baldwin Bulot, and Richard de Cam-
ville ; and in the meantime prepared for his daughter, Joanna,
the things necessary for her equipment and journey. After
these were all completed in a becoming manner, the king sent
his daughter, Joanna, to be married to William, the king of
Sicily. When she had arrived at Palermo, in Sicily, toge-
ther with Gilles, bishop of Evreux, and the other envoys of our
lord, the king, the whole city welcomed them, and lamps, so
many and so large, were lighted up, that the city almost seemed
to be on fire, and the rays of the stars could in no way bear
comparison with the brilliancy of such a light: for it was
by night that they entered the city of Palermo. The said
daughter of the king of England was then escorted, mounted
on one of the king's horses, and resplendent with regal gar-
ments, to a certain palace, that there she might in becom-
ing state await the day of her marriage and coronation.

After the expiration of a few days from this time, the be-
fore-named daughter of the king of England was married to
William, king of Sicily, and solemnly crowned at Palermo,
in the royal chapel there, in presence of Gilles, bishop of
Evreux, and the envoys of the king of England, who had been



414 ANNALS OF EOGEE DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1176.

sent for that purpose. She was married and crowned on the
Lord's day before the beginning of Septuagesima, being the
ides of February; and was with due honor endowed with the
county of Saint Angelo, the city of Siponto, the city of Vesta,
and many other castles and places. Whereupon, the king of
Sicily executed in her favour his charter, as follows :

The Charter of William, king of Sicily, ichich he executed in
favour of Joanna, daughter of Henry, king of England, as to
her dowry.

" In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the
Holy Ghost, Amen. Amid the other blessings of peace, the
nuptial tie binds and fastens the most strongly the unison and
the concord of human affairs; a rite, both venerable from
the weightiness of its obligations, remarkable in the circum-
stances of its institution, and sanctioned by universal usage,
from the beginning of the world and of time ; of which the
virtues and the comeliness, inasmuch as it has derived its origin
from Divine institution, have neither contracted blemish from
sin, nor have been sensible of any diminution by desuetude,
through the lengthened ages of past time. Moreover, to this
venerable and mysterious institution this honor is added, that
the consent of the man and of the woman to enter matrimony,
typifies the sacramental bond of Christ and His Church. Being
therefore led by the nature of this great and mysterious insti-
tution, and by veneration for the same, we, William, by the
favour of the Divine grace, king of Sicily, and of the dukedom of
Apulia, and of the principality of Capua, do unite unto ourselves
by the laws of matrimony and the bond of wedlock, with the
Divine sanction and under happy auspices, the maiden Joanna,
of royal blood, and the most illustrious daughter of Henry, the
mighty king of the English ; to the end, that her fidelity and
chaste affection may produce the blessings of the married state,
and that by her a royal offspring may, by the gift of God, here-
after succeed us in the kingdom, which, both by reason of its
endowment with all virtues, and of its title by birth, by the Di-
vine grace, both may and ought to be raised to the throne of this
realm. But, inasmuch as it is befitting our exalted position that
so noble and illustrious an alliance should be honored with a be-
coming dowry, by this present writing we do give, and as a
dowry, do grant to the before-named queen, our most dearly be-



A.D. 1176. MARRIAGE CHAETEE OF THE PRINCESS JOANNA. 415

loved wife, the county of Mont Saint Angelo, the city of
Siponto, and the city of Vesta, with all the rightful tenements
and appurtenances thereof. We do also grant for her service, out
of the tenements of count Godfrey, Alesina, Peschiza, 86 Bicum,
Caprile, Barano, and Filizi, and all other places which the
said count is known to possess as of the honor of the said
county of Mont Saint Angelo. In like manner, we do also
grant for her service, Candelari, Saint Clair, 87 Castel Pagano,
Bersenza, and Cagnano. We do also grant, that there shall be
as of the honor of the said dowry, the monastery of Saint Mary
de Pulsano, and the monastery of Saint John de Lama, with all
the tenements which those monasteries hold of the honor of
the aforesaid county of Saint Angelo upon condition that the
queen, our aforesaid wife, shall always recognize all the rights
of our heirs, who by our ordinance shall succeed us in the king-
dom, and shall do unto our said heirs, fully and unreservedly,
all services for the tenements above- written, according as the
tenure in fee thereof shall require, and shall always observe
her fealty to them. Wherefore, in remembrance of the said
gift and grant, and for the inviolable establishment thereof,
we have commanded this present charter 88 to be written by the
hand of Alexander, our notary, and, the golden bulla, our seal,
being impressed thereon, to be confirmed with our said seal,
and graced therewith. Unto which, by our command, the
personages of our household and others have subscribed their
names in manner following:

I WALTER, archbishop of Palermo.

I ALFANTJS, archbishop of Capua.

I RICHARD, bishop of Syracuse.

I BARTHOLOMEW, bishop of Agrigento.

I NICHOLAS, first archbishop of Messina.

I RTJFFTJS, archbishop of Cosenza.

I THEOBALD, bishop and abbat of the royal monastery of
Saint Mary Nuova.

I ROBERT, bishop of Catana.

88 Hardly any of these places can now be traced under these names.

87 This is probably the name of the place, though in the text it is
called f ' Sanctum clericum."

88 Called by the singular name of " privilegium," which was the usual
name of charters confirming grants to churches.

Given at the nourishing city of Palermo by the hands of
Walter, the venerable archbishop of Palermo, Matthew, vice-
chancellor of the king, and Richard, the venerable bishop of
Syracuse, members of the household of our lord the king, in
the year from the incarnation of our Lord one thousand one
hundred and seventy-seven, in the month of February, being
the tenth year of the indiction ; and in the eleventh year of
the happy reign of our lord William, by the grace of God,
the mighty and most glorious king of Sicily, of the dukedom
of Apulia, and of the principality of Capua, Amen.

[Sealed with the seal of William, king of Sicily.]

[Here follows in the original, the form of the bulla or seal,
which contains around the margin the words "Dextera Domini
fecit virtutem. Dextera Domini exaltavit me. Dextera Domini
fecit virtutem." " The right hand of the Lord hath created my
might. The right hand of the Lord hath exalted me. The right hand
of the Lord hath created my might'' 1 In the central portion is a

cross surmounted by the words " DivinS, favente elemental Wil-
lielmus rex Sicilise et ducatus Apuliae et principatus Capuae."
" By the favour of the Divine mercy, William, king of Sicily,
of the dukedom of Apulia, and of the principality of Capua.' 1 The
cross is supported by the following words. " Hoc signum sibi
praeferri a vexillifero facit cum ad bellum aliquod procedit."
" This sign he causes to be borne before him by his standard-bearer
when he goes forth to battle."]

In the same year pope Alexander sent Vivianus, cardinal
priest, as legate from the Apostolic See to Scotland and the
adjoining islands, and Ireland and Norway, to hear causes
ecclesiastical, and to determine the same according as God
should assist him therein. When he arrived in England, our
lord the king sent to him Eichard, bishop of Winchester, and
Geoffrey, bishop of Ely, to ask him by whose authority he had
presumed to enter his kingdom without his permission. Upon
this question being put to him, the above-named cardinal was
greatly alarmed, and, to give satisfaction to the king, made
oath that he would do nothing connected with his legateship
against his wishes ; upon which, liberty was given him to pass
through the kingdom into Scotland, and our lord the king
found his escort and expenses until he arrived in the domi-
nions of the king of Scotland.

In the same year, Geoffrey, bishop of Ely, was charged before
the king by Roger, archbishop of York, with having laid violent
hands upon him at the before-mentioned synod, which Huge-
zun was to have held at London; however, he proved his
innocence, by declaring on his word of truth that he had not
laid violent hands on him, and the same was attested by the
above-named archbishop of Canterbury, on the Word of our
Lord ; whereupon Roger, archbishop of York, and Geoffrey,
bishop of Ely, were reconciled.

In addition to this, at the urgent request of our lord the
king, the archbishops of Canterbury and York agreed to
terms between them for the space of five years, both as to the
dispute which existed between them relative to the blows
inflicted on the archbishop of York, as well as the other ques-
tions which were the causes of contention bet ween them and their
churches, submitting themselves entirely to the arbitration
and decision of the archbishop of Rouen and of the bishops
of the kingdom of France ; and they made oath that they would

TOL. I. E E



418 AOTTA1S OF ROGER DE HOVEDEH. A.D. 1176.

abide by their decision, and that neither of them would in the
meantime seek to do any harm or injury to the other.

In the same year, William, earl of Gloucester, son of earl
Eobert, brother of the empress, gave his daughter in marriage
to John, the son of the king of England, together with the
earldom of Gloucester, in case he should be able to marry the
said damsel with the sanction of our lord the pope. In return
for this grant, the king of England, the father, gave to the
elder daughters of the said earl two hundred pounds of yearly
revenues in England, namely, to the wife of Amaurus, earl of
Evreux, one hundred pounds, and to the wife of Richard, earl
of Clare, one hundred pounds.

In the same year died Philip, brother of Louis, king of
the Franks, and archbishop of Rheims, and was succeeded by
William, archbishop of Sens, he making this exchange of arch-
bishoprics with the permission of Alexander, the Supreme
Pontiff. In this year also, master John 88 of Salisbury, formerly
a clerk, and attached to the household of Saint Thomas of Canter-
bury, the martyr, was made bishop of Chartres. In this year
also, our lord the king of England, the father, gave Ireland to
his son John. In the same year died Richard, earl of Striguil,
whom our lord the king had made justiciary of Ireland ; upon
which our lord the king appointed in his room William
Fitz-Aldelm, who took possession for the king of all the for-
tified places which the aforesaid earl had possessed in Ireland.

In the same year, William, earl of Arundel, departed this
life, and was succeeded by his son William. In this year also
died William de Courcy, justiciary of Normandy, and was suc-
ceeded by William Fitz-Ralph. In this year also, Frederic,
emperor of the Romans, assembled a large army of Germans
and Alemannians, and fought a battle near Securo, between
Comae and Milan, with the Lombards, which lasting from
morning until the evening, the emperor, having lost the greater
part of his army, was put to flight ; and among the others
whom he lost, his standard-bearer was taken prisoner, and,
with many others, was placed by the Lombards in confinement.

In this year also the king, the father, caused the castle and

fortifications of Leicester to be destroyed, as also the castle of

Groby, the castle of Tresk, 89 the castle of Malesart, the new

castle of Alverton, 90 the castle of Fremingham, the castle of
Bungay, and nearly all the castles of England and Normandy
which had taken part against him in the time of the war. But
the castle of Pasci and the castle of Mountsorrel he retained in
his own hands, the latter having been awarded to him on the
oaths of a jury of lawful men of TTrsuet. In the same year died
Ralph de Dotis, in Berry, whose daughter and heir our lord the
king of England, the father, gave in marriage to Baldwin de
Rivers, together with the honor of the castle of the said Ralph.
In the same year, on the sixteenth day before the calends of
November, being the Lord's day, the church of the canons
regular at Cirencester, in honor of Mary, the blessed Mother
of God, was dedicated by Bartholomew, bishop of Exeter, in
presence of our lord the king of England, the father, who,
at its dedication, bestowed large revenues on the said church.
In the same year Manuel, emperor of Constantinople, having
fought a pitched battle with the sultan of Iconium and de-
feated him, wrote to the king of England to the following
effect :

The Letter of Manuel, emperor of Constantinople, to the king
of England, the father.

"Manuel Porphyrogenitus Comnenus, the emperor, ever
faithful in Christ, crowned by the will of heaven, the sublime,
potent, exalted, ever august, and ruler of the Romans, to Henry,
the most noble king of England, his most dearly-beloved
friend, health and every blessing. Inasmuch as our imperial
office deems it necessary to notify to you, as being its beloved
friend, all things which befall it, it has therefore considered it
proper to inform you upon the events which have lately taken
place. Now, from the very earliest period of our coronation, our
imperial office nourished hatred in our heart against the Persians,
the enemies of God, when it beheld them vaunting over the
Christians, triumphing over the name of God, and holding
sway over the lands of the Christians. Wherefore, on another
occasion, without delay, it made an attack upon them, and, as
God granted it to do, even so it did do. As to the exploits which
were frequently performed by it, to their humiliation and loss,
our imperial office entertains a belief that the same have not
escaped the notice of your highness. However, we did more

recently determine also to lead a most numerous army against
them, and to wage war against the whole of Persia, inasmuch
as by circumstances we were compelled so to do. Still, much
of our preparations were made not according as we should
have wished, or as appeared best suited to our object. How-
ever, in such way as occasion allowed us, and the state of
events, means were taken to ensure a powerful attack upon
them. Accordingly, for this purpose our imperial office col-
lected around it all its resources : but, inasmuch as it had to take
with it waggons carrying vast weights of arms and implements,
both mangonels 91 and other engines applicable to the storming
of cities, it was consequently far from able to proceed with
expedition on the march. Still further, while the army was
passing on through its own country, and before any of our
barbarian foes had engaged us in war, a most intractable
malady, namely, a flux of the bowels, attacked us ; which,
spreading among the troops of our empire, made its way among
them all, and, a more dangerous antagonist than any warriors
could be, slew and destroyed vast numbers. This malady,
waxing more and more formidable, greatly weakened our
forces. As soon as we had entered the territories of the
Turks, that instant was heard the din of numerous bat-
tles, and the troops of the Turks engaged in combat with
the armies of our empire on every side. However, through
the grace of God, the barbarians were entirely put to flight by
our men. But, after this, when we drew near to the narrow
passes of an adjacent spot which the Persians call Cibrilcima,
so many hordes of foot and horse, most of which had come
from the interior of Persia, came up to the support of their
fellow-countrymen, that, on meeting our army, they almost
exceeded the numbers of our men. In consequence of the
narrowness of the road and the difficulties of the passage,
the army of our empire was extended in a line fully ten miles
in length ; and, inasmuch as who went first were unable to
support those who came last, and again, on the other hand,
those who came last were unable to aid those who went before,
it was no common misfortune that this distance lay between
them. Indeed, the troops that formed the van were divided
by a very considerable interval from the main body of our

noruru " in the text.

army, having at last forgotten it 92 altogether, and not waiting
for its coming up. In consequence of this, as the troops of the
Turks, from the battles that had already taken place, knew
that it was not for their advantage to attack us in front, find-
ing that the narrowness of the passage was likely to serve them
in great stead, they determined upon attacking the rear, which
they accordingly did. Now the passage all along consisting
of a very narrow defile, the barbarians rushed upon us, attack-
ing us on the right hand and on the left, and in all possible
quarters, and their darts, falling upon us like a shower, slew
a vast number of men and horses; Upon this, finding that disas-
ters were there thickening apace, on taking due consideration,
our imperial office thought proper to await those who were
in the rear, for the purpose of supporting them, which it did
accordingly, and, in so waiting, had to support itself against
the infinite numbers of the Persians. What exploits it per-
formed while thus hemmed in by them it is not necessary
upon the present occasion to state ; perhaps your highness
will learn more on that subject from those who were pre-
sent on the occasion. "While our imperial office was doing
its duty amid these dangers, and bearing the entire brunt of
the conflict, the entire rear-guard, formed of Greeks, Latins,
and all other varieties of nations, being wedged into a mass, and
not being able to bear up against the darts thrown by the enemy,
pushed onward 93 with the most vigorous efforts, and was
borne along with the greatest violence while making all haste
to gain an adjoining hill, that might serve as a sort of fortress ;
those rushing on carrying on the others, whether they would or
no. The consequence was, that, a vast cloud of dust being
raised which quite overpowered the eyesight and allowed no
one to see what lay at his feet, men and horses, thus rush-
ing on without restraint, were borne over a precipice close at
hand and overhanging a very deep valley. Thus, falling one
upon another, they trod each other to death, and killed
not only numbers of the common soldiers, but even some of
the most illustrious and most nearly related of our kinsmen.

93 Probably this is the meaning of the passage, which appears to be
incorrectly printed, " illas " standing for " illam." Indeed the whole
letter is a tissue of corruptions and omissions.

9 * " Impactione " seems to be the reading, and not " in pactione," as in
the text.



422 AKNA1S OF BOGEB DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1176.

For, indeed, who could possibly make head against the insup-
portable onset of so vast a multitude ? However, as to our
imperial office, hedged in on every side by such vast bodies of
the barbarians, inflicting wounds and receiving wounds in
return, we still used efforts that excited in them no small
alarm, in consequence of their surprise at our perseverance,
and which we did not relax until by the benign aid of God
we had reached the open country. Nor did it allow the enemy
to scale the position which it took up, from which to cany
on the battle with the barbarians, nor yet through fear of
it did it spur on its horse, for the purpose of effecting a
more speedy retreat. On the contrary, our imperial office,
rallying all its body guard, and rescuing them from destruction,
ranged them around itself; and thus it reached the vanguard,
and then going on through the ranks in order, came to the main
body of the army. Upon this, the sultan seeing that in spite
of such great disasters as had befallen our army, our imperial
office was, as became it, arranging matters for the purpose of
again attacking him, sent word to us, and suppliantly begged our
imperial office, and employed the language of entreaty, suing for
peace, and promising to fulfil every wish of our imperial office,
to give us his services against all men, to release all the
prisoners who were detained in his kingdom, and in every way
to conform to our desires. Wherefore, having then stayed there
for two whole days with all our forces, we became sensible that
nothing could be effected against the city of Iconium, having
lost our besieging sheds 94 and engines of war, in consequence
of the oxen which drew them being slain by the darts that
had been hurled upon us like a shower. Another reason was,
the fact that all our animals were afflicted by this most intract-
able malady which had now attacked them. We therefore lis-
tened to the supplications of the sultan, and a treaty, confirmed
by oath, having been made beneath our standards, peace was
granted to him. Upon this, departing thence, our imperial office
returned to its own country, entertaining no small sorrow for
those kinsmen whom it had lost, but still returning especial
thanks to God, who has, in His kindness, and still does, honor
it. We have also felt it a pleasure that it so happened
that some of the chief men of your nobility were with us,
who will, at your desire, inform you on all the circumstances
94 "Testudinibus."

in the order in which they happened. However, although we
have been afflicted with deep regret for those who have fallen,
we have still deemed it advisable to inform you upon all the
events that have happened, as being our dearly-beloved friend,
and as being closely united with our imperial office, by the
ties of blood that exist between OUT children. Farewell.
Given in the month of November, in the tenth year of the
indiction."

In the same year, Henry, king of England, son of the
empress Matilda, gave Eleanor, his daughter, in marriage to
Alphonso, king of Castille. In this year also, Gilbert, the son
of Fergus, chief of the men of Galloway, who had caused his
brother, TJcthred, a kinsman of Henry, king of England, to be
slain, came into England, with the safe conduct of William,
king of the Scots, and did homage to king Henry, the father,
and swore fealty to him against all men : and, to obtain his favor,
he gave him a thousand marks of silver and his son Dunecan
as a hostage, by way of pledge that he would keep the peace.
In the same year, Henry, king of England, the father, laid
hands upon all the castles of England and Normandy, both of
the bishops as well as of the earls and barons, and placed his
custodians therein. In this year, also, Peter, the prior of
Wenlock, was made bishop of Saint David's, in Wales.

The Arian Heresy and its Condemnation?*

In the same year the Arian heresy, which had corrupted
nearly the whole of the province of Toulouse, was condemned
in the presence of the archbishops, bishops, and other pious
men, whose names are underwritten.

For there were in the province of Toulouse, certain heretics,
who would have themselves called good men, and were upheld
by certain knights of the town of Lombez, who propounded
things, and taught the people the same, contrary to the Christian
faith ; they said also that they did not receive the law of Moses,
nor the Prophets, nor the Psalms, neither the Old Testament,
nor yet the doctors of the New Testament ; but only the
Gospels, the Epistles of Saint Paul, the seven Canonical Epis-
tles, the Acts of the Apostles, and the Book of Revelations. 5S
On being interrogated as to their faith, and as to the baptism of

95 These alleged heretics were the people of Alby, or, as they are gene-
rally called, the Albigenses. x It is hard to see what part of the
New Testament they did reject. Probably " Old" Testament is meant.

infants, and whether they were saved by baptism, and as to the
body and blood of our Lord, where they were consecrated, and
by whom, and who partook thereof, and if the same was more
efficaciously or better consecrated by a good man than by a
bad one ; also as to marriage, whether they could possibly be
saved, if a man and woman were carnally united : they made
answer that as to their faith and as to the baptism of infants
they would not say, nor were they obliged to say. As to the
body and blood of the Lord, they said that he who partook
thereof worthily was saved, and he who did so unworthily
ensured his own damnation thereby. As to marriages, they
said that man and woman were joined together for the avoiding
of sensuality and fornication, as Saint 97 Paul says. They also
said many things upon which they were not questioned, as,
that they ought not to swear by any oath whatsoever, in con-
formity with what Saint John says in his Gospel, and Saint
James in his Epistle.

They also said that Saint Paul preached that bishops and
priests were to be ordained in the church, and that, if such
were not ordained as he directed, they would not be bishops or
priests, but ravening wolves, hypocrites and seducers, lovers
of salutations in the market-place, and of the chief seats and
higher places at feasts, and desirous to be called "Rabbi,"
contrary to the commands of Christ ; wearers of albs and white
garments, and of rings of gold and gems on their fingers,
which their master did not command them to do. That
consequently, because the bishops and priests were just such
men as the priests were who delivered up Jesus, it was their
duty not to obey them, because they were evil.

Accordingly, the allegations having been heard on both sides
before Gerard, bishop of Alby, and judges having been chosen
and appointed by either side, and the aforesaid Gerard, bishop
of Alby, Roger, abbat of Castres, Peter, abbat of Aire, the
abbat of Candiel, and Arnold of Narbonne, presiding and as-
senting thereto, the said matters were discussed in the pre-
sence of worthy men, both of the prelacy and clergy, as
also of the laity, that is to say, of Peter, the lord archbishop
of Narbonne, and other bishops, abbats, archdeacons, counts,
and influential men of that province to the number of
twenty, and of nearly the whole population of Alby and

Lombez. Against the things that had been propounded
by the said heretics, many authorities were quoted from the
New Testament by Peter, the lord archbishop of Narbonne,
the bishop of Nismes, the abbat of Cahors, and the abbat of
Font-froid ; for the said heretic refused to receive judgment,
except on the New Testament. The following definite sentence,
upon the authority of the New Testament, was accordingly pro-
nounced by the bishop of Lyons, all observing strict silence in
the presence of all the persons above-mentioned :

" I Gilbert, bishop of Lyons, by command of the bishop of
Alby and of his assessors, do adjudge these persons to be
heretics, and do condemn the opinions of Oliverius and of his
associates, wheresoever they may be ; and the following judg-
ment, based on the New Testament, we do pronounce

" On the first head we do pronounce and adjudge them to
be heretics. For the law is to be received through the Gospel,
and he who receives not the law believes not our Lord Jesus
Christ ; for in the Gospel he says, ' For had ye believed Moses,
ye would have believed me : for he wrote of me.' 97 And
again, ' I am not come to destroy the law, but to fulfil it.' 98
And again, 'All things must be fulfilled which were written
in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the Psalms con-
cerning me.' 99 Also, 'And beginning at Moses he ex-
pounded unto them in all the Scriptures the things concerning
himself.' l But why did he expound the Scriptures, and why did
he teach concerning the Law and the Prophets, except that he
wished them to receive the Law and the Prophets, and that by
the Law and the Prophets they might be confirmed in their
belief ? Many things also did the Lord Jesus quote from the
Law and the Prophets and the Psalms, which indeed a good
teacher certainly would not have done if the Law and the
Prophets and the Psalms were not to be received. In deed also
he showed that the law was good, inasmuch as he was circum-
cised, and presented in the Temple, and sacrifice was offered
for him according to the law of Moses. Also, we find it written
that he went up on the day of the feast. In the Transfigura-
tion also, where Moses and the prophet Elias appeared unto
him, they bore testimony unto him. By the Epistles also we
do convict them ; for Saint Paul says, ' Whatsoever things were

426 AWNAXS OF ROGER DE HOVEDE1T. A.D. 117fi.

written aforetime were written for our learning ;' 2 and again,
' All Scripture is given by the inspiration of God ;' 3 and ' I say
none other things than those which the prophets have said
should come.' 3 * And again, Saint Peter says ' We have a more
sure word of prophecy.' 4 And that the doctors are to be re-
ceived, Saint Paul bears witness, ' God hath set some in the

Church as teachers.' 8 Saint Paul also quotes the example

of the law, saying, ' Cursed is every one that continueth not
in all things which are written in the book of the law to do
them.' 6 And both he himself as well as the other Apostles
give many testimonies in favour of the Law and the Prophets
and the Psalms ; a thing which they would not have done if
their words were not to be received. These heretics therefore
are bound by their own admission to receive Moses and the
Prophets and the Psalms, if only upon the testimonies which
are borne by Jesus and the Apostles, and no others. For do we
not say that if an instrument or written testimonial is believed
in any part thereof, it ought to be entirely believed, or else to
be received in no part thereof? 7

" On the second head we do convict and adjudge them to be
heretics, upon the authority of the New Testament. For we
say that he holds not the Catholic faith, who does not confess
it when he is asked thereon, or when his faith is made trial of.
For this reason the Lord says, in the Acts of the Apostles, to
Ananias, relative to Saint Paul, ' For he is a chosen vessel
unto me to bear my name before the Gentiles and kings and
the children of Israel.' 8 Also, the Lord says of the centurion ;
' I have not found so great faith in Israel.' 9 When the
Apostles were fordidden to speak in the name of Jesus Christ,
Peter boldly said, 'We ought to obey God rather than men.' 10 A
person on being asked as to his faith in Jesus Christ, ought to
answer as Peter answered ; for on being asked by the Lord, whom
do men say that the Son of Man is ? he made answer, ' Thou
art Christ, the Son of the living God.' " The blind man also,
on being asked, after receiving his sight from the Lord, if
he believed in the Son of God, answered, 'I believe, Lord.' 12
So Martha, on being asked by the Lord, ' Believest thou this?'

made answer, ' Yea, Lord ; I believe that them art the Christ,
the Son of the living God, which hast come into this world.' 13
So also the Apostle says ; ' "With the heart man believeth unto
righteousness ; and with the mouth confession is made unto
salvation.' 14 Also, at the end of his Epistle 15 Saint Peter says
(we are better able to commit to memory what we find said
at the conclusion of a discourse) ; ' But sanctify the Lord God
in your hearts; and be ready always to give an answer to every
man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with
meekness and fear.' And whereas these heretics boasted that
they do not lie, we affirm that clearly they do lie. For there
is falsehood in being silent as well as in speaking. It was for
this that Saint Paul boldly withstood Saint Peter 16 to the face,
because he practised circumcision. For it seemed to Saint Paul
that he could not reveal the truths of the Gospel, because he
preached one thing and believed another. For truth consists
in three things, in the heart, in the words, and in the works.
He speaks the truth who expresses in the articulation of his
voice what are his feelings, and who holds the same in his
heart, confesses it with his lips, and performs it in his works.

" On the third head, we do also convict and adjudge them
to be heretics, upon the authority of the New Testament. For
we say, that it is the wish of God that every man should be
saved. Nor, indeed, would Christ have been crucified for
all, if only the older ones were to be saved, who to original
sin have added actual sin, and if infants were not to be
saved, whom God has created and formed in His own image and
likeness, and who have probably never committed any sin, but
have only contracted original sin. For baptism was generally
given unto all, both old and young, as the Lord says to his dis-
ciples, ' Go ye, teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of
the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.' 17 And
' Except a man be born again of water and of the spirit, he
cannot enter into the kingdom of God.' 18 And again, the
Lord says, ' Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid
them not.' 19 This indeed he said for two reasons. For one,
because those who wish to be saved must become as little

children, with reference to wickedness and guile, and simple
like them, in such manner as He himself says : ' Unless ye
become as this little child ye cannot enter the kingdom of
heaven.' w He also says so, in order that the Apostles and
their followers may never he in douht as to the baptism of little
children, for baptism succeeded in the place of circumcision,
which had been enjoined both for those grown up and for
infants. Baptism too is a more general and extensive ordi-
nance, inasmuch as both males and females are baptized, and
grace is thereby secured . But, if through faith children are
saved, as they themselves cannot have faith, without Vhich it
is impossible to please God, we say that it is through the faith
of the Church, or through the faith of the sponsors, just as the
man sick of the palsy was cured through the faith of those
who carried him and let him down through the tiles. The
son also of the nobleman, and the daughter of the woman of
Canaan, were healed at that same hour at which the noble-
man and the woman of Canaan believed. We do also say, that
baptism ought to be celebrated in the Church, and by the
ministers of the Church, unless necessity compels otherwise.
Wherefore Saint Paul uses these words, ' Who hath made us
able ministers of the New Testament.' 21

" On the fourth head, we do convict and adjudge them to be
heretics, upon the authority of the New Testament. For the
body of our Lord is consecrated by the priest only, whether
he is good or whether bad. For by the holy words, which
the Saviour pronounced at the supper, namely, ' This is my
body, and this is my blood,' the body of our Lord is consecrated
and made. For just as the messenger of the emperor, or of
the king of France, or of any other powerful person, does not
by his low estate or ragged condition, corrupt or render vile the
words of his master, so in like manner, the words of our Lord
are neither changed nor blemished. And, just as a ray of the
sun, when it passes through the common sewer, contracts neither
stain nor fetid smell, or as water passes clear and transparent
into the cisterns through pipes that are dirty, foul, or muddy,
so are the words of the Lord not polluted, nor are they uttered
with better or more pure effect by a good man than by a bad
one, ' For with God there is no variableness, neither shadow of
turning.' 22 But, that the body of the Lord ought to be con-

20 The sense of this passage is found in St. Mark x. 15, and St. Luke
xviii. 17. Zl 2 Cor. iii. 0. a James i. 17

secrated nowhere but in the Church ; Saint Paul says, ' Des-
pise ye the Church of God ? Have ye not houses to eat in ?' a
So also Saint Paul says to Titus, 24 ' That thou mayst know how
thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is
the Church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.'
And it is the duty of all the faithful to receive their instruc-
tion in the Church. Wherefore it is that Saint Paul says, ' Let
your women keep silence in the churches, for it is not permit-
ted unto them to speak.' 25 For this, which man eats, is the
bread of angels, which has descended from heaven ; and as
the manna which had been rained from heaven, and the rod of
Aaron which had blossomed, were kept in the ark, as also the
tables which had been written by the finger of God, so is
the body of our Lord not consecrated, or kept except in the
Church, as being the most pleasing sanctuary of the Lord. And
in the same manner as the ark was carried on their shoulders
by the Levites only, and was under their care, and as the Le-
vites only ministered in the tabernacle of the Lord, so, to the
priests alone, and to their servants, has been delivered and en-
trusted the care of the Church. Of this ark the Lord speaks
in the Revelation ; ' the heaven was opened, and there was
seen in His temple the ark of His testament.' 26 Moreover,
to the priests alone has been given the power of binding
and loosing; wherefore the Lord says unto Peter, 'What-
ever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven ; and
whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven.' 27
Saint Paul says also to Timothy, M 'For this cause left I thee in
Crete, that thou shouldst set in order the things that are want-
ing, and ordain elders in every city.' Also, with regard to
orders, the Apostle says, ' Let the elders that rule well be ac-
counted worthy of double honor.' M Likewise : ' Against an
elder receive not an accusation, but before two or three wit-
nesses.' 30 Again: 'Deacons must be grave;' 31 and, 'To
all at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons, grace be imto
you, and peace.' 32 Behold then to whom it is that the Lord
commits the words of warning and of correction ! Also, Saint
Paul says, ' Reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long-suffering

and doctrine.' 33 Also, the Lord says to his disciples, ' Teach
them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you.' M
These elders, therefore, hishops, and deacons, it is the duty of
both clergy and laity to obey, for the sake of God, whether
they are good or whether bad. For this reason it is that the
Lord says, ' The Scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat;
all, therefore, whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe
and do ; but do not ye after their works ; for they say, and do
not.' 3S And Saint Paul, 36 speaking of authorities, says, ' Be
subject to your masters with all fear ; not only to the good
and gentle, but also to the froward :' and, ' Let a bishop be
able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gain-
sayers.' 37 And again, ' Obey them that have the rule over you,
and submit yourselves ; for they watch for your souls, as they
that must give account ; that they may do it with joy and not
with grief.' 38 Also, ' Remember them which have the rule
over you, who have spoken unto you the word of God, whose
faith follow, considering the end of their conversation.' 39 Also,
' He that waiteth at the altar is a partaker with the altar.' 40
And, ' If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great
thing if we shall reap you carnal things ?' 41 Saint Paul says
also to Timothy : ' But continue thou in the things which
thou hast learned and hast been assured of for, from a child,
thou hast known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make
thee wise to salvation.' **

" On the fifth head, we do convict and adjudge them to be
heretics, on the authority of the New Testament. For they
refuse to admit that a man and woman can be saved if they are
carnally united ; inasmuch as they are in the habit of openly
preaching the doctrine that a man and woman cannot obtain
salvation after carnal connexion. Consequently, they com-
mend and approve of the multiplication of cattle, and yet disap-
prove of the multiplication of mankind. They admire sterility
in woman, according to the words of Scripture, ' Blessed are
the barren, and the wombs that never bare.' 43 This doctrine
they preach, in order that but few owners may be found for ob-
jects innumerable, and that the creatures which have been made
for the use and service of men may be without possessor, in-

habitant, or ruler, wishing all to be like themselves, as

Saint Paul says, ' I would that all were such as I am.' **

And then they would appear to preach up the merits of virginity,
as being the state of Christ and of the Virgin Mary, although
it was He who said : ' Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish
the earth.' 45 Indeed, they seem thereby to detract from the
character of- marriage, and to condemn it, while our Lord
Jesus Christ graced a marriage with his own presence, and
that of his mother Mary and of his disciples, and honored
it with the miracle of turning water into wine. Besides, it
is said in the Gospel, '"What "God hath joined together, let
not man put asunder;' 46 and, ' Let it not be lawful for a man
to put away his wife, except for fornication.' 47 Also, Saint
Paul says: 'He who giveth his virgin in marriage, doeth
well.' 48 And, again, ' The woman is bound by law to her
husband so long as he liveth.' 49 'The wife hath not power
of her own body, but her husband ;' 50 and similarly with re-
gard to the husband. Likewise, he says : ' Defraud ye not
one the other, except it be with consent for a time, that ye may
give yourselves to prayer ; and come together again that Satan
tempt you not.' 5l And, ' I will that the younger women marry,
bear children, keep house.' 52 And further, ' I say it not, but
the Lord ; a woman shall be saved in childbearing.' a If it
were a sin to beget children, why should the Lord say, why
should the Apostle say, that it is good ? And why should he
tell them to come together again, and use the expression, ' I
will that' ? Does God will, does the Apostle will, that a sin
should be committed ? We are of the belief, then, that a man
and woman may be saved, even if they are carnally united.

" On the sixth head we do convict and adjudge them to
be heretics, and cut off from the unity of the Church, on the
authority of the New Testament. For we say that the Lord
delivered unto Saint Peter the ministry and the power of bind-
ing and loosing, saying, 'Whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth,
shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt loose on
earth, shall be loosed in heaven ;' M and, ' I send unto you pro-
phets, and wise men and scribes.' 55 But, as the Lord says,
' Not all men can receive this saying.' M And further, we say,

that they ought to make answer respecting the Gospel, and to
dispute thereon, standing, inasmuch as all Christians stand when
the Gospel is read ; and if they stand when it is read, much
more ought they when it is hoth read and expounded : nor,
indeed, ought they to adopt the mode of sitting after they have
once made choice of standing. We have also many authorities,
from which it is manifestly gathered that a person ought to
stand when the Gospel is preached ; as, for instance : ' Jesus
stood on the shore ;' " and, again, ' Jesus stood still and
called them;' 58 and, again, 'He stood in the midst of you
whom ye know not.' 59 And, again, after his resurrection,
confirming the Apostles, and preaching, 'Jesus stood,' it is
said, ' in the midst of the disciples, and said, peace be unto
you.' 60 These people too hold not the position of one giving
judgment, but of one making answer ; and it is the Lord that
ought to sit, to whom all judgment has been given by the
Father. As for these people, they do not judge, but are judged.
Nor has there been granted to them the mystery of preaching in
the churches. Indeed, these are heretics, such as Saint Paul
foretells that there shall be, saying, 'Evil men and seducers
shall wax worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived ;' 61 as
also ' The time will come when they will not endure sound

doctrine, but shall turn away their ears from the truth,

and shall be turned unto fables ;' 62 and, ' From which some
having swerved, have turned aside unto vain jangling; desiring to
be teachers of the law ; understanding neither what they say,
nor whereof they affirm.' ** Indeed, it is the duty of the pre-
lates of the Church to punish the disobedience of these persons,
and to correct it before all men. Wherefore, the Apostle says,
' Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear.' 64
Saint Paul says, also, to the prelates [of the Church] : ' Hav-
ing in a readiness to revenge all disobedience.'" And, ' That
ye may be able to convince the gainsayers.' M And, ' These
things speak, and exhort and rebuke with all authority.' 67
Also, I have ' delivered such an one unto Satan, for the de-

In the seventh place, the above-named bishop questioned
them upon repentance, if it could take place at the last moment,
unto salvation, or whether soldiers who had received a fatal
wound could be saved if they repented at the last moment: or
if each ought to confess his sins to the priests and ministers
of the Church, or to any one of the laity, or to those of whom
Saint James has said : " Confess" your faults one to another;" 71
to which they made answer, and said, that it was sufficient for
the sick if they confessed to whom they pleased ; but that, as
to soldiers, they were unwilling to say, as Saint James
speaks only of the sick. He also asked them if contrition of
the heart and confession by the lips were alone sufficient, or if
it was necessary to make atonement after repentance [by con-
fession], by fasting, alms-giving, and mortification, thus be-
wailing their sins, if they had the means of so doing. To
this they made answer, saying that the words of Saint James
were : " Confess your faults one to another, that ye may
be healed :" by which they understood that the Apostle com-
manded nothing else but that they should confess, and so
should be healed ; and that they had no wish to be wiser
than the Apostle, so as to add anything of their own, as
the bishops did. To this the heretics added, that the bishop
who had given judgment was the heretic and not they,
that he was an enemy to them, a ravening wolf, a hypocrite,
and an enemy to God, and that he had not given a righteous
judgment ; that they were not willing to make answer on their
faith, because they were on their guard against him, in obe-
*dience to what our Lord had commanded in the Gospel,
" Beware of false prophets which come to you in sheep's cloth-
ing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves ; " 7i and that he
was a fraudulent persecutor of them, and they were prepared
to show by the Gospels and the Epistles, that he was not a
good shepherd, neither he nor the other bishops and priests,
but, on the contrary, were hirelings.

To this the bishop made answer and said, that the judgment

had been pronounced upon them legally, and that he was
prepared to prove in the court of our lord Alexander the Catholic
pope, or in the court of Louis, king of France, or in the court
of Raymond, count of Toulouse, or in that of his wife, who
was then present, or in the court of Trenkevelle, the pre-
sental, 73 that he had given a right judgment, and that they
were manifestly heretics, and notorious for their heresies. He
further declared that he would accuse them and publish them
as heretics in every Catholic court, and would submit to all
the risk thereof.

The heretics, seeing that, they were convicted and put
to confusion, turned towards the people, and said, " Listen,
good people, to the faith which we confess ; for now, for our love
of you and for your sakes, we do make confession of it;" on
which the above-named bishop made answer, " Do you say
that you pronounce it, not for the sake of God, but for the
sake of the people?" The others then said, "We believe
that there is one God, three and one, the Father, the Son,
and the Holy Ghost, and that the Son of God took upon
Him our flesh, was baptized in the river Jordan, fasted in the
wilderness, preached our salvation, suffered, died, and was
buried ; that He descended into hell, rose again on the third
day and ascended into heaven ; that, on the day of Pen-
tecost, He sent the Holy Ghost the Comforter; that He will
come on the day of judgment to judge both the living and
the dead ; and that all shall rise again. We know, also, that
what we believe in the heart we ought to confess with the
lips ; we believe that he is not saved who does not eat tbe
body of Christ, and that the body of Christ is not consecrated
except in the Church, and only by the priest, whether he is
good or whether bad, and that it is no more efficiently done
by one who is good than by one who is bad. We believe, also,
that no person is saved unless he is baptized, and that infants are
saved by baptism. We believe, also, that a man and woman
can be saved even though they be carnally united ; and th;it
each person ought to receive confession, both in the lips and in

73 This was an officer in France, who had the command of the soldiers
in a county or earldom, and acted as deputy of the " comes," " count," or
" earl." The name does not seem to have any corresponding one in the
English language. The same party is called " vicecomes," " viscount," or
" sheriff," at the conclusion of the proceedings, p. 436.

the heart, and from a priest; and that baptism ought to be per-
formed by the priest, and in churches ;" and that, if anything
more could be pointed out to them, as supported by the autho-
rity of the Gospels or the Epistles, they would believe the
same and would confess it.

In consequence of this, fresh authorities of the New Testa-
ment were quoted against them by the above-named Catholic
persons. After the authorities had been so heard on both
sides, the above-named bishop 74 arose and pronounced judg-
ment to the following effect :

" I, Jocelyn, bishop of Lodeve, by the command and man-
date of bishop Alberic, and of his assessors, do pronounce
judgment, and do here affirm, that these heretics are wrongly
informed on the subject of an oath, and that, if they wish to
do right, they ought to take the oath, and that an oath ought
to be taken when a person's faith is in question. And, inasmuch
as they are infamous and notorious for heresy, they are bound
to prove their innocence ; and, returning to the unity of the
Church, they are bound to uphold their faith upon oath in such
way as the Catholic Church maintains and believes ; in order
that the weak who are in the Church may not be corrupted,
and that the diseased sheep may not contaminate the whole
flock. And this is neither contrary to the Gospel nor to the
Epistles of Saint Paul. For although it is said in the Gospel
' Let your communication be yea, yea, nay, nay;' 73 'neither shalt
thou swear by the heaven, nor by the earth,' 76 still it is not for-
bidden to swear by God, but by his creatures. For the Gen-
tiles were in the habit of worshipping the creatures, and, if it
had been allowed to swear by the creatures, the reverence and
honor that are due to God alone would be paid to the creatures,
and, in consequence, idols and creatures would be adored as God.
R>r we read in the book of Revelation, that an angel 'Lifted up
his hand to heaven and sware by him that liveth for ever and
ever ; ' " and Saint Paul, in his Epistle to the Hebrews/ 8 says,
' Because God could swear by no greater, he sware by Himself.
For men verily swear by the greater, and an oath for confirmation
is to them an end of all strife.' Where God has wished more
abundantly to show to the heirs of His promise the immove-

74 This is an error ; he has not been previously mentioned.

436 ANNALS OF ROGER DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1176.

ableness of His counsels, he has interposed an oath. For the
Lord sware, saying, ' By myself have I sworn.' 79 And again,
'The Lord hath sworn, and will not repent.' 80 The Apostle,
also, frequently made oath ; thus, ' God is my witness,' 81 and
' I call God to witness.' If, then, God has sworn, an Angel
sworn, an Apostle sworn, how is it right not to swear, especi-
ally where our faith is in question ? Therefore, that which is
said in the Gospel 82 and in the Epistle of James is to be deemed
a piece of advice and not a precept. But, if there were no
swearing, there would be no forswearing, a thing which is still
more nearly allied to 83 evil, that is to say, to sin or the devil,
who would prompt us to swear by the creatures."

Accordingly, seeing that they were also convicted on this
point, they said that bishop Alberic had made an agreement
with them that he would not compel them to take an oath ;
which, however, the bishop of Alby denied. After this, the
bishop of Alby arose, and said, "The judgment which Jocelyn,
bishop of Lodeve, has pronounced I do confirm, and by my
command the same has been pronounced. And I further warn the
knights of Lombez not to give them any countenance, on pe-
nalty of the fine which they have placed in my hands. I, the
abbat of Candiel, chosen judge, do approve of this judgment,
and with my assent it has been given. I, the abbat of Aire,
chosen judge, do approve of this judgment, and with my assent
it has been given. I, Arnold de Be, chosen judge, do ap-
prove of this judgment, and with my assent it has been given.

to be heretics, and do approve of the judgment pronounced upon
them."

In the year of grace 1177, being the twenty- third year of
the reign of king Henry, son of the empress Matilda, the said
Henry, and Geoffrey, earl of Brittany, and John, his sons, were
at Northampton, in England, during the festival of the Nativity
of our Lord. On the same day, king Henry, the son, and his
wife were at Argenton in Normandy, and Richard, the son of
king Henry, earl of Poitou, was in Aquitaine, at the city of
Bourdeaux. Immediately after, the Nativity of our Lord,
he laid siege to the city of Aques, which Peter, viscount of
Aques, and the count of Bigorre had fortified against him,
and within teji days he took it. After this, he laid siege to
the city of Bayonne, which Ernald Bertram, viscount of Bay-
onne, had fortified against him, and within ten days he took it.
Moving his army thence, he came to the gates of Sizarre, now
called Port D'Espagne, and took and destroyed it, and, by
force, compelled the Basques and Navarrese to make oath,
that, from that time forward, they would always keep the
peace towards strangers and among themselves, and he also put
an end to all the evil customs that had been introduced at
Sorges and Espure.

In the meantime, the king of England, the father, holding
a general council at Northampton, after the feast of Saint
Hilary, restored to Robert, earl of Leicester, all his lands on
both sides of the sea, as he held the same fifteen days before
the war began, with the exception of the castles of Mount-
sorrel and Pasci. In like manner he restored to Hugh, earl
of Chester, all the lands of which he was in possession fifteen
days before the war; and to William d'Aubigny, son of Wil-
Jiiam, earl of Arundel, he gave the earldom of Sussex. At the
same council, also, Guido, the dean, resigned into the hands of
Richard, archbishop of Canterbury, his deanery of Waltham, and
quitted claim, freely and absolutely, of all right which he had
to the church of Waltham. In the same manner did the canons
secular of Waltham as to their prebends, resigning them into
the hands of the archbishop ; but our lord the king gave them
full compensation for the same, according to the estimate of the
lord archbishop of Canterbury. After this, our lord the king,
by the authority of our lord the pope, placed in the same
church of Waltham canons regular taken from various houses



438 ANNALS OF ItOGEli DE HOYEDEff. A.D. 1177.

in England, and appointed Walter de Ghent, a canon taken
from the church of Oseney, the first abbat of that community,
and enriched them with great revenues and very fine man-
sions.

In the same year, the same king, having expelled the nuns
from the abbey of Ambrosebury, 84 for incontinence, and dis-
tributed them in more strict charge in other religious houses,
gave the abbey of Ambrosebury as a perpetual possession to the
abbess and convent of Fontevraud ; and, a convent of nuns
being sent over from Fontevraud, Richard, archbishop of Can-
terbury, introduced them into the abbey of Ambrosebury, on
the eleventh day before the calends of June, being the Lord's
Day, in the presence of our lord the king, the father, Bar-
tholomew, bishop of Exeter, John, bishop of Norwich, and
many others of the clergy and the people. On the same
day, and at the same place, the before-named archbishop of
Canterbury consecrated Guido, bishop of Bangor.

In this year, Philip, earl of Flanders, sent Robert, the advo-
cate of Bethune, and Roger, castellan of Courtrai, to our
lord Henry, the king of England, the father, to inform him
that Louis, king of the Franks, had asked of him the eldest
daughter of his brother, Matthew, earl of Boulogne, in mar-
riage for his son Philip, and the other daughter of the
earl of Boulogne for Louis, son of earl Theobald, but that
he was determined to give them to no one without his sanc-
tion. The said earl also asked the king of England for the
money which he had promised to give for the soul of his
brother, Matthew, earl of Boulogne, for the purpose of maintain-
ing knights for the defence of the land of Jerusalem. On this,
our lord the king made answer to them that the matter would
go well, unless, indeed, it stopped short with the earl ; 85 and
added, that if the earl of Flanders was willing to marry his
nieces, the daughters of the earl of Boulogne, according to his
wishes and advice, and would give him good assurance of the
same, he would then fulfil all his promises, even to a fuller extent
than he had made them. And, for the purpose of hearing the
earl's answer on the subject, he sent Walter de Coutances, his
vice-chancellor, and Ranulph de Glanville, in whose presence
the said earl of Flanders made oath that he would marry his
said nieces to no person, unless by the advice and consent
81 Amesbury. M Perhaps in allusion to earl Theobald.






A 1). 1177. AGREEMENT BETWEEN AXPHONSO AND SANCHO. 439

of the king of England, the father. However, disregarding
his oath, the said earl married them without the leave and
consent of the king.

In the same year, the before-named Vivianus, cardinal priest,
titular of Saint Stephen de Monte Celi, and legate of the
Apostolic See, was in the Isle of Man, with king Guthred,
on the day of the Nativity of our Lord. After the Epi-
phany, he passed over into Ireland, and, landing at Dun 86 in
Ulster, while he was walking along the sea-shore towards
Dublin, he met the troops of John de Courcy, who seized him
and made him prisoner ; but John de Courcy set him at
liberty and suffered him to depart. The before-named John
de Courcy also, before the Purification of Saint Mary, laid
siege to and took the city of Dun, which is the capital of Ulster,
where also rest the bodies of Saint Patrick and Saint Columba,
the confessors, and of Saint Bridget, the virgin. On hearing
this, Koderic, king of Ulster, levied a large army of Irish,
and fought a battle with the above-named John ; and John
de Courcy, after losing a part of his army, gained a great
victory, and having conquered king Eoderic, and put him to
flight, remained in possession of the field, and distributed the
spoils of the slain among his men. In this battle was taken
prisoner the bishop of Dun, whom John de Courcy ordered, at
the prayer of the cardinal, to be set at liberty.

In the same year died the earl Hugh Bigot, whose treasures
the king, the father, retained in his own hands. In this year,
also, Alphonso, king of Castille, and Sancho, king of Navarre,
his uncle, after many and great battles fought between them,
came to a settlement before the king of England, the father, on
the disputes and claims that existed between them. Accord-
ingly, there came into England, on behalf of the king of Cas-
tille and on behalf of the king of Navarre, four chosen men whom
they knew to be trustworthy persons, being sent to England
to hear the decision of the court of the king of England, and
to report the same to the above-named kings of Spain, namely,
John, bishop of Tarragona, Peter de Areis, Gunter, a brother
of the Temple, and Peter de Rinoso. There came also on
behalf of Alphonso, king of Castille, Matthew, bishop of Palencia,
count Gomez, Lobdiez, Gomez, the son of Garsias, Garsias, the
son of Garsias, Peter, the son of Peter, and Gotteri Fcrnanz ;
86 Down.



440 ANNALS OF KOGER DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1177.

and, on behalf of Sancho, king of Navarre, the bishop of
Pampeluna, Garsias Bermer, Sancho, the son of Kamiro,
Espagnol de Taissonal, Peter, the son of Ramiro, and
Ascenar de Chalez. All these were sent to assert their claims,
and to answer on behalf of their masters. There came also
two knights of wonderful prowess and valor, with horses and
warlike arms, one on behalf of the king of Castille and the other
on behalf of the king of Navarre, to appeal to wager of battle,
at the court of the king of England, if it should be deemed
necessary.

Accordingly, on the first Lord's day in Lent, our lord, Henry,
king of England, son of the empress Matilda, came to London,
for the purpose of holding a general council. At it were
present ; Richard, archbishop of Canterbury, Gilbert, bishop
of London, Hugh, bishop of Durham, Geoffrey, bishop of Ely,
Walter, bishop of Rochester, Reginald, bishop of Bath, Robert,
bishop of Hereford, John, bishop of Norwich, Bartholomew,
bishop of Exeter, Roger, bishop of Worcester, John, bishop
of Chichester, Christian, bishop of Whitherne, the bishop of
Saint David's, the bishop of Saint Asaph, the bishop of Ban-
gor, and the abbats, priors, earls, and barons of England.
These having met together at Westminster, the king ordered
the aforesaid envoys from the kingdom of Spain to reduce into
writing their claims and charges, and afterwards give them
to him ; in order that, by means of a translation thereof, he
himself and his barons might be able to understand their
respective claims and charges ; for neither the king nor the
barons of his court understood their language. Eor the pur-
pose of reducing this to writing, there was a space of three
days allowed.

Accordingly, on the fourth day they produced a writing, in
which was the following statement : " king Sancho the Fat had
three sons, Ferdinand, king of Castille, Ramiro, king of Arra-
gon, and Garcias, king of Navarre and Nagara. Ferdinand was
the father of king Alphonso, who took Toledo, and was the
father of queen Vracha, who was the mother of the emperor
Alphonso, the father of king Sancho, whose son was king
Alphonso, who married Eleanor, daughter of Henry, king
of England. Ramiro, king of Arragon, was the father
of king Sancho, who was father of king Peter and king Al-
phonso. King Peter died without issue, and was succeeded
by his brother, king Alphonso, who took Saragossa. Garcias,



A.D. 1177- TREATY BETWEEN ALPHONSO AND SANCHO. 441

king of Navarre and Nagara, was the father of king Sancho,
who was afterwards slain at Penafiel : he was the father of
Sancho, who died without issue when a child, and was suc-
ceeded, in Navarre and Nagara, hy king Alphonso, his father's
kinsman, who took Toledo, as far as the boundaries of Puente
la Keyna and Sangosa : and the said child was succeeded by
Sancho, king of Arragon, his father's kinsman, in the remain-
ing portion of Navarre and Pampeluna.

The Treaty and Covenants entered into between Alphonso, Icing
of Castille, and Sancho, king of Navarre.

" These are the treaty and covenants which were entered into
between Alphonso, king of Castille, and Sancho, king of Navarre,
his uncle, for submitting the points in dispute between them to
the judgment of the king of England. For this purpose each of
these kings gives three castles in pledge, that he will receive
and fulfil the award of Henry, king of England, son of the
empress Matilda, and father-in-law of king Alphonso ; and he
who shall fail so to do, is to lose the castles underwritten. For
this purpose king Alphonso gives in pledge Nagara, a castle of
the Jews, Arnedo, a castle of the Christians and a castle of the
Jews, and Celorigo. In like manner, Sancho, king of Navarre,
gives in pledge the castle of Stella, which Peter, the son of
Roderic, holds, being a castle of the Jews, as also Funes and
Maranon. And for the above purpose envoys from both kings
are to appear in the presence of the king of England on the first
day of this present Lent, being the beginning of the fast, for
the purpose of receiving his decision. And if by chance the
envoys on either side shall be detained on the road in con-
sequence of death, infirmity, or captivity, the envoys that
precede them are to await them for a period of thirty days be-
yond the day above-named at the court of the said king of
England ; and then, those who are well and able are to come
to the court and hear the decision. And if all shall be sick, or
taken prisoners, or shall die, then the king who has no envoy
present is to be the loser. And if all or any of the envoys
shall not be detained by any of these causes, and shall not come
before the king of England on the day appointed, then the
king, whose envoys they are, is to lose the castles above-
named, and this is to be done in good faith and without
evil intent. And if by accident, which God forbid, the king



442 ANNALS OP BOGKB DE HOVEDEIT. A.D. 1177.

of England should die in the meantime, then in the same
manner as above-mentioned they are to proceed to the king of
France to receive his decision, and are to receive his decision
as though that of the king of England, and to comply there-
with. For this purpose, Sancho, the king of Navarre, through
his knight and his deputy, 87 is to receive possession of these
three castles, and is to give Nagara and Celorigo in charge
to Peter, the son of count Roderic, and is to give Arnedo in
charge to one of the counts of his dominions, and they are to
do homage to him for the same. In like manner Alphonso,
the king of Castille, through his knight and his deputy, is to
receive possession of these three castles, and is to give Stella
in charge to Peter, the son of Roderic of Arragon, Funes to
S., the son of Ramiro, and Maranon to R., the son of Mar-
tin, and they are to do homage to him for them. And if
either of the kings shall wish to take the castles afore-
said from the knights in possession of them and to give them
to another, then Sancho, king of Navarre, is to give them to
Peter, the son of Roderic, or to G., the son of Vermund, or to
S., the son of Ramiro, or to I., the son of Felez, or to R., the
son of Martin, or to E. or to S., the sons of Almoran, or to E.,
the son of Ortiz, or to P., the son of Ramiro, or to G. or to P.,
the sons of Ortiz. In like manner king Alphonso is to give
the said castles to count N. or count P., or count G. or to count
Gomez, or to R., the son of Gurtez, or to P., the son of Arazuri,
or to D., the son of Senez, or to G. or to Ordonez, the sons of
Garcias, or to G., the son of Roderico de Aragra, or to P., the
son of Gunter, or to L., the son of Roderico de Agafra; but
those who shall be holding them are not to give up the said castles
until those who ought to receive them shall have done homage
for them to the other king, in manner above-mentioned. And
the whole that king Alphonso holds of the king of Navarre he
is to improve with his own means as far as he shall be will-
ing and able. In like manner, Sancho, king of Navarre, is to
improve with his own means as far as he shall be willing
and able, the whole that he holds of king Alphonso. And
for the purpose of hearing this decision, the kings have chosen
four trustworthy persons, namely, John, bishop of Tarragona,

87 " Portarius." The officers who were so called, had probably some-
what similar duties to those of our sheriffs ; in seeing that the royal com-
mands were properly fulfilled. They were peculiar to Spain.

Peter de Areis, AT de Torrela, and Gunter, 68 son of

de Binoso ; and two or three or all of these are to proceed
with the envoys to the court of the king of England, and are
to explain before him the complaints of both kings, and when
the claims have been heard, then those are to speak whom
the king shall order first to plead their cause. And, upon the
word of these same trustworthy persons, who shall have heard
the judgment pronounced by the king of England, each of
the kings are to comply with and perform the above-mentioned
covenants in such manner as is contained in this instrument,
and the knights who have done homage for the aforesaid cas-
tles, according to the report of the said trustworthy persons, are
to comply with and perform the treaty aforesaid in good faith
and without evil intent. In addition whereto, both of the kings
above-named, each upon his own plighted faith, have agreed
upon and concluded a good and safe truce for liegemen, for
castles, for lands, and for all other things, for a period of seven
years ; and that the same shall be firmly kept, Sancho, king
of Navarre, places Erga 89 in pledge, and king Alphonso pledges
Calahorra ; and if the army of either of these kings, either
with him or without him, shall enter the kingdom of the other,
he whose army does so, is to lose the fortified place above-
named. And if by chance any vassal of these kings shall
break this truce in the kingdom of the other, or shall chance
by force to take a fortified place, then the king of whom
he shall be the vassal shall within forty days deliver up his
castle to the other king. And if he shall not do so, the
knight who holds the castle that has been so placed in pledge, is
to give up the said castle to the king so complaining, and he is to
hold the same in pledge until he recovers his own castle. And
if any person in these kingdoms, who is not a vassal of those
kings, shall by any chance take a castle in the kingdom of the
other, then both the kings are to come against him with their
people and besiege him, and are not to depart thence until it is
taken. It has also been agreed that all the vassals of both
kings who have lost their hereditaments since the time of the

88 It will be seen, on comparison with the list of names previous, and
in page 439, that Gunter is mentioned as one of the envoys and Peter de
Rinoso as another, and no mention is made of de Torrela : here, however,
Gunter is made the son of de Rinoso, and de Torrela is the fourth envoy.

commencement of the war, shall recover the same, in such
manner as they were holding them on the day on which they
lost them, and for misdeeds on their part, or on accusations
for what they have previously done, they are not to lose them,
nor are they to make answer to any one on any complaint
made against them within the last seven years. And if here-
after any complaint on fresh grounds, or any litigation shall
arise between them, they are to have recourse to arbitration,
and whatever judgment shall be pronounced, they are to be
satisfied with the same. Also, all men of both kingdoms shall
go and return from kingdom to kingdom in security, with the
exception of known murderers. And if either of the kings
shall be unwilling to restore the hereditaments as above-men-
tioned, then he is to give up the above-named castle to the
other king, who is to hold the same in pledge, until he shall
recover the hereditaments and the whole thereof that he shall
have demanded. Also, all vassals of either king are to be
included in this treaty of peace as to all men, castles, here-
ditaments, and all other things that they may possess in what-
ever land they may be ; and all the above is to be kept and
observed in good faith and without evil intent. Also, Al-
phonso, king of Arragon, is to be included in this truce, if
it shall so please him, and if perchance it shall not please him
to be included therein, nevertheless the said truce as above-
mentioned is to be strictly observed between the kings above-
named. This instrument was made between Navarre and
Logrono, in the year 1214, 90 on the eighth day before the
calends of September."

An [earlier] Charter of Peace and Reconciliation between the Icing
of Castille and the king of Navarre.

" This is the charter of peace and reconciliation which was
made between Alphonso, king of Castille, and Sancho, king of
Navarre, at the abbey which is called Siterio. It has pleased
both of the said kings that a peace and reconciliation should be
made between them for ten years, which has been made accord-
inglv ; and it has pleased them that they should ratify the
same by oath, and that they and the barons of them both
should make oath upon the altar and upon the four Evange-

conquest of Spain by Augustus, in the year B.C. 38.

lists, that they mil observe the aforesaid truce and reconcili-
ation faithfully, and without fraud and evil intent, for ten
years ; and this truce has been made as to persons, cattle,
goods, and castles, in good faith and without fraud and evil
intent ; and if either of the kings or any of the barons shall
violate this truce, and shall not make amends on claim made,
within forty days therefrom, then is he to be a perjurer and a
traitor. This instrument was made in the year 1205, 91 in the
month of October."

When the above-stated charters of peace and reconciliation
between the said kings of Castille and Navarre had been read
before the king of England and his barons, the persons who
pleaded for the king of Castille spoke to the following effect :

The Claim of the king of Castille.

" In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
Ghost, Amen. In the name of the Lord, Alphonso, king of
Castille and Toledo, makes complaint against, and demands of,
Sancho, king of Navarre, his uncle, that restitution shall be
made to him of Logrono, Athleva, Vanaret, 92 in the vicinity of
Ribaronia, Agosen, Abtol, Arresa, and Alava, with their mar-
kets, namely, those of Estwalez and of Divina, and all his rights
in the lands which are called Durango : all of which king Al-
phonso, of happy memory, who liberated Toledo from the power
of the Saracens, and after his death, his daughter Vracha pos-
sessed by hereditary right : after whose death, her son, the
emperor Alphonso, of happy memory, was similarly possessed
by hereditary right, and after the death of the emperor, his
son, Sancho, without question raised, held the same by
hereditary right. After the death of king Sancho, his son,
our lord the king, Alphonso, in like manner held all the
places aforesaid by hereditary right, until such time as the
king of Navarre already mentioned took away, and now by
force withholds, from the aforesaid king of Castille, his orphan
and innocent nephew and ward, and the son of his friend and
lord, all the above places, no requisition being then made of the
same. He likewise makes complaint and asks restitution to
be made to him by the before- named king of Navarre, qf
lloba, which he unjustly withholds. For the emperor ac-

91 See the last note. This treaty was made nine years before the pre-
ceding one. w This should be, Navarette.



446 AITNALS OF ROGEK DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1177.

quired that place from a king of the Saracens, whose name was
Zafadola, and left it to his son Sancho, who, after the death of
the emperor, held it in peace during the whole period of
his life : after whose death, my lord the king Alphonso, his
son, hy hereditary right held it in peace, until such time
as Sancho Kamirez de Perola parted with it, who held it ac-
cording to the custom of Spain, at the hands of Peter Ortiz,
which Peter Ortiz held it according to the same custom of our
lord the king Alphonso. He also demands the revenues which
the king of Navarre so often mentioned has received from
Logrono, and from all the places above-named, from the time
of his invasion, as also recompense for the losses which he in-
flicted upon that land, by laying it waste and delivering it to
the flames, the amount of all which is estimated at nearly one
hundred thousand golden marks. He further demands Puente
la Reyna, and Saragossa, and the whole of the land extend-
ing from those two towns to the river Ebro ; which land king
Alphonso, of blessed memory, grandfather of the emperor,
held and enjoyed in peace ; and through him, according to
the custom of Spain, his kinsman, Sancho, king of Arragon,
and after his death, his son, king Peter, and after the death
of king Peter, his brother, Alphonso, king of Arragon, in the
same manner as his kinsmen and friends had held it. He
also claims a moiety of Tudela, on the grounds of his mater-
nal descent, which count Dalpreg gave to his cousin-german,
queen Margaret, who was the wife of king Garsias, and grand-
mother of the said king Alphonso, in consequence whereof
the aforesaid Tudela does in no way belong to Navarre."

After the bishop of Palencia, and count Gomez, and the
other envoys of the king of Castille had set forth the above,
and other matters to a similar effect, both by writing and
word of mouth, they made an end of speaking. Upon this,
the bishop of Pampeluna, and the other envoys of the king
of Navarre, arose, and [orally] contradicting nothing that
had been alleged against them by their opponents, produced
a writing, in which were contained their petition, claims,
and allegations, to the following effect :

The Claim of the king of Navarre.

" Sancho, king of Navarre, lays claim to the monastery of
Cudejo, Monte d'Oca, the valley of Saint Vincent, the val-



A.D. 1177. THE CLAIM Of THE KIXG OF NAVABRE. 447

ley of Oliocastro, Cingovilas, Monte Negro, and Sierra Alba,
as far as Agreda. To all the above he lays claim, and
whatever places lie within these districts on the side of
Navarre, and he lays claim to the entire revenues of this
district, from the period of the death of king Sancho at Pe-
nan 1 el. All the above, as belonging to his kingdom, Garsias,
king of Navarre and Nagara, great-great grandfather of
the said king Sancho, held and enjoyed in peace and quiet-
ness ; and his great grandfather was expelled by violence from
his kingdom, on account of his imbecility, by Alphonso, king
of Castille, his kinsman. However, in process of time, king
Garsias, of famous memory, his grandson, and father of the
present king, by the Divine will, and with the aid of the
fealty of those of whom he was the natural lord, recovered his
kingdom, although not the entirety thereof, and the remaining
portion is the same that is now claimed by his son Sancho,
king of Navarre. In addition to this, he makes claim of
the following places, which the emperor took from his father,
king Garsias, by violence, namely ; Naga, a castle of the Chris-
tians and Jews, Gramon, Pancorvo, Belforest, the monastery of
Cereso, Celorigo, Bilboa, Medria, Yegueta, Claver, Verbea, and
Lantaron. These same he makes claim of, and demands res-
titution thereof, because his father, king Garsias, possessed
them by hereditary right, and the emperor took them from
him. Also, as to Belforest, he makes this complaint, that
the empuror restored the same to king Garsias, his father, and
after his death, the said emperor took it away from Sancho,
the present king of Navarre, who then held and enjoyed
it in peace, as being his own by hereditary right. He also
demands restitution to him by Alphonso, king of Castille,
of certain castles that have been veiy recently taken from him,
together with all the revenues received therefrom, and whatever
he would have enjoyed if he had not been expelled therefrom.
The names of these castles are as follow : Kel, Ocon, Parnu-
gos, Gramon, Cereso, Valorcanas, Trepcana, Milier, Amihugo,
Haiaga, Miranda, Santa Agathea, Salinas, Portela, Malversin,
Legiun, and the fortress held by Godin. And to these he lays
claim on the grounds that he held and enjoyed the same
as his own, and was, without any judicial formalities, ex-
pelled therefrom, and his complaint ought therefore to have
the precedence, inasmuch as the same was the last act of



448 ANNALS OF EOGEK DE HOVEDEJT. A.D. 1177-

violence committed, and consequently is the one for which
amends should first be made. And further, as to the other side,
he has ceased to have any right, if ever he did have any such
right. And this we are prepared to show by the above-
named instrument, in which is contained a truce for ten years;
wherefore, king Sancho makes complaint, because it is true,
that king Alphonso has violated his promise made in the
treaty aforesaid. For he has received injury within those ten
years, by being deprived of the following castles, Kel,
Legiun, Malversin, and Portela. In addition to the above,
the king of Navarre demands restitution by the king of
Castille, of the sum of one hundred 92 marks of silver, king
Sancho, who now reigns over the kingdom of Navarre, hereby
offering satisfaction to the king Alphonso, upon all his com-
plaints, according to the arbitration of the barons of them
both, or of the most serene king of England. And we affirm
with confidence, that these acts, and the like to them, perpe-
trated in the face of such covenants and such truce, ought
to be redressed before we come to any other article what-
ever of these claims. For this the law demands, this usage
demands, this the canonical ordinances demand, this all right
and justice demand. The things that we have said are here
set forth in written characters, but shall be more fully and
more copiously explained by word of mouth."

When the above-named envoys of the king of Navarre had
set forth the above, and other matters of a similar nature, and
the envoys of the king of Castille did not contradict any of
the allegations made by them, Henry king of England, son of
the empress Matilda, the Holy Evangelists being produced in
presence of all the people, ordered the said envoys of the king
of Castille and the king of Navarre make oath, before he
pronounced judgment, that their masters, namely, the king of
Castille and the king of Navarre, would receive and strictly
observe his award, both as to restitution as well as to the
truce, and that if they should fail so to do, then they them-
selves would surrender their bodies into his hands and power.
This being accordingly done, the earls and barons of the
royal court of England adjudged that full restitution should
be made to each of the parties above-named of what he had
rightfully claimed. Accordingly, the king of England wrote
to the above-named kings of Spain to the following effect :
y - Probably, a mistake for a hundred thousand.



A.O. 1177. A.WAKD OF THE KING OF ENGLAND. 449

The Award of Henry, king of England, upon the judgment given in
his court between the king of Castille and the king of Navarre.

" Henry, by the grace of God, king of England, duke of
Normandy and of Aquitaine, and earl of Anjou, to his most
dearly beloved friends Alphonso, king of Castille, and Sancho,
king of Navarre, greeting. According as, from the tenor of
your letters, and the relation of your trustworthy servants,
John, bishop of Tarragona, Peter de Areis, Gunter, 93 and Peter
de Binoso, and from the assertions of your envoys, the bishop
of Palencia, count Gomez, Lobdioz, Gomez, the son of Garsias,
Garsias, the son of Garsias; Peter, the son of Peter, Gotteri
Fernanz, the bishop of Pampeluna, Garsias Bermer, Sancho
the son of Ramiro, Espagnol de Taissonat, Peter the son of Ba-
miro, and Ascenar de Chalez, we have been informed, it has
pleased us by our judgment to bring to a termination the dis-
putes that exist between you, with relation to certain castles
and lands, together with the boundaries and appurtenances
thereof. And for that purpose, we, receiving your trustworthy
servants and your envoys with that respect which was their
due, considering that peace being made between you would
greatly conduce to the honor of God and the whole of Christen-
dom, have both with reference to holy religion and our ordinary
welfare, taken this upon us. Therefore, the trustworthy per-
sons chosen by you in common, and your deputies, and the
pleaders of your causes being summoned into our presence, and
that of our bishops and earls and barons, we have carefully
heard, and have come to a full understanding of, the petitions
and allegations of both parties. Upon these points, those
envoys to whom the cause of Alphonso, king of Castille, has
been entrusted, have made allegation that Sancho, king of
Navarre, did unjustly and by force take from the said king of
Castille, while he was yet a ward and an orphan, certain cas-
tles and lands, namely, Logrono, Navarette, Andeva, Abtol,
and Agosen, 94 with all their boundaries and appurtenances,
which his father, on the day of his decease, and which he him-
self for some years after had quietly enjoyed ; in consequence
whereof they claimed that restitution should be made to him
of the same. But the envoys to whom the cause of Sancho

king of Navarre was entrusted, contradicting nothing of what
had been alleged by the others, asserted that Alphonso the
before-mentioned king of Castille, had, by arms, and unjustly,
taken from Sancho, the before-named king of Navarre, certain
castles, namely, Legiun, Portela, and the castle that Godin
holds, and the said other party, making no contradiction what-
ever thereto, demanded with like urgency that restitution should
be made thereof to him. And further, it was stated in the
letter written by you in common that you had, giving your
word for the same, concluded a truce between you for a
period of seven years, and the same was witnessed openly in
court by your envoys. Having therefore held counsel with
all due deliberation with our bishops, earls, and barons, and
considering that peace between you is necessary, both for
the propagation of the Christian faith and the confusion of the
enemies of Christ, and receiving a full assurance, both from
your own written declarations and the allegations of your en-
voys, that you will pay obedience to our counsel and advice
both in establishing and preserving peace, before proceeding to
pronounce our award as to the above-written complaints and
truces, we do command you by your envoys, and do counsel
and enjoin you, and in addition thereto, do, by this present
writing, command you, to establish peace between yourselves,
and faithfully for the future to observe the same. Now, as to
the complaints above-mentioned relative to the castles and lands,
with all the boundaries and appurtenances thereof, that have on
each side been by force and injustice taken from the other, in-
asmuch as no answer was made by either side to the acts of
violence alleged on the other side, and no reason was alleged
why the restitution which they respectively demanded should
not be made, we do decree that full restitution shall be made
to each party of the places above-mentioned which have as of
right been claimed. We do also by our award enjoin that the
truces between you before-named, which, as already mentioned,
have been ratified by you on your word, as appears from your
written documents, as also from the public avowal made to us
by your envoys upon trial, shall, until the time therein agreed
upon, be inviolably observed between you. We do will also
and command for the sake of peace, that king Alphonso, our
dearly beloved son, shall pay to Sancho, king of Navarre, his
uncle, every year for the space of ten years, three thousand

marabotins 94 such payments to be made at three periods in the
year at the city of Burgos, namely ; the first payment of one
thousand marabotins to be made at the end of the first four
months after the above-mentioned restitution shall have been
made, the second payment of one thousand marabotins to be
made at the end of the next succeeding four months, and ano-
ther payment of one thousand marabotins to be made at the
end of the next four months ; the said payments so to be made
that in each of the ten years next ensuing after the said restitu-
tion, there shall be paid to Sancho, king of Navarre, at the same
periods and at the above-named place, three thousand marabo-
tins. Also, the envoys of each of you have, before pronouncing
our judgment, solemnly sworn that you will strictly observe our
judgment aforesaid, both as to the restitution as well as to the
observance of the treaty of peace ; and that in case you shall
not do so, they will surrender their persons into our hands and
power. Witnesses hereto, Richard, archbishop of Canterbury,
Hugh, bishop of Durham, Geoffrey, bishop of Ely, Roger, bishop
of Worcester, Bartholomew, bishop of Exeter, Gilbert, bishop of
London, Walter, bishop of Rochester, Reginald, bishop of
Bath, John, bishop of Norwich, John, bishop of Chichester,
Robert, bishop of Hereford, the bishop of Saint David's, Master
Ada, the bishop of Saint Asaph, the bishop of Bangor, Chris-
tian, bishop of Whitherne, Geoffrey, earl of Brittany, son of the
king, William, earl of Aumarle, Robert, earl of Leicester,
William de Mandeville, earl of Essex, William, earl of Glou-
cester, William de Arundel, earl of Sussex, Hugh, earl of

liam de Vesci, Henry de Lacy, Odonel de TJmfraville, Robert de
Vals, Roger de Mowbray, Robert de Stuteville, Philip de
Kimbe, Roger Bigot, and many others, both clergy and laity."

slain by night at London, and thrown out from his inn into the
mud of the streets, for which deed our lord the king took into
custody many of the citizens of London ; among whom there

the spoils of the Moors when repulsed in their invasion of Spain. It is
said that it was while energetically discussing the origin of this word at
Caen, the learned Bochart was attacked with a fit of apoplexy, of which
he shortly after died.

was arrested a certain aged man of high rank and great wealth
whose name was John ; he being unable to prove his inno-
cence by means of the judgment by water, offered our lord the
king fifty pounds of silver for the preservation of his life.
But inasmuch as he had been cast in the judgment by water,
the king refused to receive the money, and ordered him to be
hanged on a gibbet.

In the same year Philip, earl of Flanders, in contravention
of the oath which he had made to the king of England, gave
the eldest daughter of his brother the earl of Boulogne in mar-
riage to the duke de Saringes ; shortly afterwards, leaving the
duke de Saringes, she married the count de Saint Paul, and then
leaving the count de Saint Paul, married the count Reginald
de Dammartin, who received with her the earldom of Boulogne.
The other daughter of the earl of Boulogne he also gave in
marriage to Henry, duke of Louvaine.

In the same year the before-named earl of Flanders came
over to England, to hold a conference with the king of Eng-
land, and, receiving from him leave to go on the pilgrimage,
he and "William de Mandeville, earl of Essex, and many barons
and knights of various countries assumed the sign of the cross,
and set out for Jerusalem; where joining the brethren of the
Temple and the Hospitallers, and Raymond, prince of Antioch,
and nearly all the knights of the land of Jerusalem, they laid
siege to Harang, a fortified place of the pagans. Having stayed a
month before it while laying siege thereto, and having almost
undermined it, by the advice of the Templars they received a
large sum of money from the pagans, and so departed without
accomplishing their object. On the day after their departure, a
great part of the castle which they had been besieging fell
down, and on returning home they found the money which
they had received from the pagans to be nothing but copper
and brass.

In the meantime, Saladin, king of Babylon, having united
with him the kings and princes of the pagans, with more
than five hundred thousand horse and foot entered the land
of the Christians, and pitched his tents not far from the
holy city of Jerusalem. On healing this, the Templars, and
Hospitallers, and knights of the king of Jerusalem, who
had remained for the protection of the city, went forth to meet
the pagans, together with the people of the city, who had
taken up arms, while the bishop of Bethlehem carried before

them the wood of the cross of our Lord. Making a bold attack
upon the pagans, they forced them to give way. and, Oh su-
preme bounty of the Most High ! the Christians, who were not
in number more than ten thousand fighting men, gained the
victory over five hundred thousand pagans, and that by the aid
of the Most High. For it appeared in a vision to the pagans as
though the hosts of the armies of heaven were descending by
a ladder under the form of armed knights, and aiding the
Christians in the attack upon them. The pagans being unable
to endure their onset, were put to. flight, on which, the Chris-
tians, pursuing them, put them to the edge of the sword, and
slew of them more than a hundred thousand, and took a great
number of prisoners. But Saladin, by means of his coursers,
made his escape ; however, in this battle he lost many of his
nephews and kinsmen, and of the principal men of his army.

In addition to this, to the utter confusion of the pagans, and
for the establishment of the Christian faith, it appeared to
the pagans that the extremity of the wood of the cross of
our Lord, which the bishop of Bethlehem was carrying, reached
up to heaven, and that its arms were embracing the whole
world ; at which being greatly alarmed, they took to flight.
The Christians, on gaining this glorious victory, returned with
joyousness to Jerusalem, and filled the land with the spoils of
the slain. This battle took place, to the praise and glory of
our Lord Jesus Christ, upon the plain of Ramah, in the year of
grace eleven hundred and seventy-seven, on the seventh day
before the calends of December, being the feast of Saint Ca-
therine the Virgin and Martyr. In the same year, the Chris-
tians fortified a very strong castle in the kingdom of Saladin,
at the Ford of Jacob, beyond the river Jordan ; but Saladin
tok it by storm, and with it was taken the grand Master of the
Hospital at Jerusalem, who, being carried into the territory of
Saladin, died there of hunger.

In the same year, our lord the king of England, the father,
delivered to William de Stuteville the custody of the castle of
Rakesburt, 95 to Roger de Stuteville the custody of the cas-
tle of the Maidens, 95 * to William de Neville the custody of
the castle of Norham, to Roger, archbishop of York, the
custody of the castle of Scartheburg, 96 to Geoffrey de Ne-
ville the custody of the castle of Berwick, and to Roger de
95 Roxburgh. * Edinburgh. * Scarborough.

Conyers the -custody of the fortress of Durham, which the king
had taken from Hugh, the bishop of Durham, because he had
only made a feint of serving him in the civil wars. In conse-
quence of this, the bishop gave him two thousand marks of
silver to regain his favour, on condition that his castles should
be left standing, and that the king should give to his son,
Henry de Pudsey, his royal manor of Wighton, with its ap-
purtenances.

After this, the king went to Oxford, and, holding a general
council there, created his son John king of Ireland, having a
grant and confirmation thereof from Alexander, the Supreme
Pontiff. To this council there also came, to meet the king,
Rees, the son of Griffin, 97 prince of South "Wales, David, the
son of Owen, prince of North Wales, who had married the
sister of the said king of England, Cadewalan, prince of Del-
nain, Owen de KevUian, Griffin de Brunfeld, and Madoc,
the son of Gervetrog, together with many other of the noble-
men of Wales, who all did homage to the king of England,
the father, and swore fealty to him against all men, and that
they would maintain peace with him and with his kingdom.
At the same council, also, our lord the king of England gave
to the above-named Ilees, the son of Griffin, the land of
Merioneth, and to David, the son of Owen, the land of Elles-
mere.

The king also gave to Hugh de Lacy, as above-mentioned,
the whole of Meath, in Ireland, with its appurtenances, for the
services of one hundred knights, to hold the same of himself
and his son John, and confirmed the same to him by charter.
He also there gave to Robert Fitz- Stephen and Milo de Cogham
the kingdom of Cork, for the services of sixty knights, to hold
the same of himself and of his son John, with the exception of
the city of Cork and one cantred, 98 which our lord the king
reserved to himself and to his heirs. He also there gave to
Hubert Fitz-Hubert, and to William, the brothers of earl Regi-
nald, and to Jollan de la Primerai, their nephew, the kingdom of
Limerick, for the services of sixty knights, to hold the same
of himself and of his son John, with the exception of the city
of Limerick and one cantred, which our lord the king reserved
to himself and to his heirs.

tenances, and enacted that the places under-written should
thenceforth be appurtenant to the services of Wexford, namely,

ment, also, of Machtaloe, with its appurtenances, Leis, the
lands of Geoflrey de Constantin, with the whole of the appur-
tenances, and the whole of the lands of Otveld.

Our lord the king also there delivered into the custody of
Robert le Poer, his marshal, the city of "Waterford, with all its
appurtenances, and enacted that the places under-written
should thenceforth be appurtenant to the services of Water-
ford, namely, the whole of the land which lies between Wa-
terford and the water beyond Lismore, and the whole of the
lands of Oiseric, with their appurtenances. The king of Eng-
land also there delivered the city of Dublin, with all its appur-
tenances, into the charge of Hugh de Lacy, and enacted that
all the places under- written should thenceforth be appurtenant
to the service of Dublin : the whole of the lands of Ofellane, with
their appurtenances, Kildare, with its appurtenances, the whole
of the hinds of Offalaia, with their appurtenances, Wicklow,
with its appurtenances, the service of Meath, and the service
of four knights due from Robert le Poer, by tenure of his castle
of Dunavet.

After our lord the king had, at Oxford, in manner aforesaid,
divided the lands of Ireland and their services, he made all the
persons to whom he had entrusted the custody thereof do
homage to himself and to his son John, and take the oaths of
allegiance and fealty to them for their lands in Ireland. Also,
at the same council, our lord the king gave to Richard, prior
of Rikeby, 99 the abbey of Whitby, and to Benedict, prior of
the church of the Holy Trinity at Canterbuiy, the abbey of
Burgh ; on which Richard, the archbishop of Canterbury, con-
secrated him abbat thereof.

and legate of the Apostolic See, having completed the business
of his legateship in Ireland, came back to England, and, with
the safe conduct of our lord the king, returned to Scotland,
and. holding a synod at the castle of Edinburgh, suspended
from the pontifical office Christian, bishop of Whitherne, be-
cause he had refused to come to the synod so held by him ; but
the bishop of Whitherne did not take any notice of the sus-
pension, being protected by Roger, archbishop of York, whose
suffragan he was.

After this, our lord the king came to Marlborough, where
the king gave to Philip de Braose all the kingdom of Limerick,
for the service of sixty knights, to hold of him and of his son.
John ; for Hubert and William, the brothers of Reginald, earl
of Cornwall, and Joslan de la Pumerai, 1 their nephew, de-
clined to accept the gift of that kingdom, because it was not
yet reduced into possession. For Monoderus, 2 who was the
king of Limerick, and had done homage for it to the king of
England, having been slain by some of his courtiers, one of
his issue, a powerful and active man, invaded the kingdom of
Limerick, gained possession of it, and ruled it with a strong
hand, acknowledging no subjection to the king of England,
and refusing to obey his officers, because of their faithless con-
duct, and the evils they had inflicted on the people of Ireland
without their deserving them. The king of Cork, also, and many-
other wealthy persons in Ireland, rose in rebellion against the
king of England and his officers ; and their last doings were
still worse than their former ones, as they fell to slaughtering
one another.

In this year, the relics of Saint Amphibalus and his com-
panions were discovered through a revelation from heaven,
and were translated to St. Albans, on the seventh day be-
fore the calends of July, being Saturday. In the same year,
queen Margaret, the wife of the king, the son, being pregnant,
went to her father, the king of France, and, on arriving at Paris,
was delivered of a still-born son. The Franks, however, as-
serted that this son of the king was born alive and was baptized,
and named William. In the same year, on the thirteenth day

John de la Pumeray.

2 He is called " Monocnlus" by Holinshed, who gives as the reason,
" because he had but one eye.

before the calends of July, it rained a shower of blood for
two whole hours, in the Isle of Wight, so much so that linen
clothes which were hung out upon the hedges were stained
with this bloody rain, just as though they had been dipped
in blood.

In this year, also, Martin, a canon-regular of the church of
Bomigny, clandestinely carried away the body of Saint Petroc,
and, taking to flight, carried it with him to the abbey of
Saint Mevennes. On discovering this, Koger, the prior of the
church of Bomigny, with the better-disposed portion of his
chapter, went to the king of England, the father, and wrought
so effectually against him that, by his precept, he commanded
the abbey and community of Saint Mevennes, without delay,
to restore the body of Saint Petroc to Roger, the prior of
Bomigny ; and, in case they should not do so, the king ordered
Roland de Dinant, the justiciary of Brittany, to take the Saint's
body by force, and deliver it into the hands of the above-
named prior of Bomigny. On hearing this, the abbat and
community of Saint Mevennes, having care for the safety of
their church, and not daring to oppose the king's wishes,
restored the said body, without any diminution thereof, to
Roger, the prior of Bomigny, making oath upon the Holy Evan-
gelists, and upon the relics of the saints, that they had restored
the identical body, unchanged, and in an entirely perfect state.

In the same year, our lord the king of England, the father,
restored to Bartholomew, the bishop of Exeter, the chapelry
of Boseham, 3 and made him chaplain thereof, Arnulph, the
Bishop of Lisieux, to whom the king had unjustly given the
^fc'd chapelry, agreeing and consenting thereto. For the above-
named bishop of Lisieux, being led to repentance, gave to the
bffore-mentioned bishop of Exeter, and to his church, letters
patent of his resignation of the said chapelry of Boseham,
renouncing the same for himself and his successors for ever.
Our lord the king, also, gave a charter of surrender and con-
firmation of the chapelry of Boseham to the church of Exeter,
in presence of Richard, archbishop of Canterbury, Geoffrey,
bishop of Ely, John, bishop of Chichester, and numerous other
witnesses. In this year also, our lord the king gave permission
to the Jews in his dominions to have a burial-ground for each
city of England, without the walls of the said cities, wherever
3 In Sussex.

they could, for a reasonable sum and in a convenient situation,
purchase a place for the burial of their dead. For, before this,
all Jews who died were carried to London to be buried.

In the same year, by the Divine mercy, pope Alexander and
Frederic, emperor of the Romans, were reconciled at Venice,
at the Rialto there ; the schism being thereby put an end to,
which had now continued in the Church of Rome for nearly
eighteen years. At this reconcilement there were present
of the party of our lord the pope, Hunbald, cardinal-bishop
of Ostia, William de Pavia, cardinal-bishop of Porto, Walter,
cardinal-bishop of Albano, Conrad, cardinal-bishop of Sabina,
Manfred, cardinal-bishop of Palestrina. John of Naples, car-
dinal-priest, Theodinus, cardinal-priest, Albert, cardinal-
priest, Peter de Bona, cardinal-priest, Bosus, cardinal-priest,
Vivianus, cardinal-priest, Herenbrand, cardinal-priest, Jacinto,
cardinal- deacon, Herdizum, cardinal-deacon, Chinche Chapel,
cardinal-deacon, Laborandus, cardinal-deacon, Hugezun, cardi-
nal-deacon, Reiner, cardinal-deacon, the archbishop of Vienna,
the archbishop of Bourges, the archbishop of Milan, the arch-
bishop of Ravenna, the archbishop of Salerno, and count Roger
de Andre, on behalf of the king of Sicily.

On the side of Frederic, emperor of the Romans, there were
present at the above-mentioned reconciliation the persons under-
named : the archbishop of Magdeburg, Philip, archbishop of
Cologne, Christian, archbishop of Mentz, the archbishop of
Besancon, the archbishop of Treves, the elector of Worms, the
prothonotary of the emperor, count Henry de Dice, the mar-
quis Albert, and many others. These having all assembled
in the city of Venice, on the ninth day before the calends of
August, on the vigil of Saint James the Apostle, the above-
named emperor, as had been previously arranged and agreed
upon, came to the church of Saint Nicholas, which is one
mile distant from Venice ; and there, both he and the arch-
bishops, bishops, and other principal men of the kingdom of
Germany, renouncing their schism, rendered themselves de-
serving to receive the benefits of absolution from the bishops
and cardinals whom our lord the pope had sent for the purpose
of absolving them.

After this, they came to Venice, where, before the church
of Saint Mark, the before-named emperor humbly paid all



A.D. 1177. THE AHTI-POPE CALIXTTJS DEGRADED. 459

honor and reverence to our lord the pope as Supreme Pontiff,
and, receiving from him the kiss of peace, devoutl} 7 placed him-
self at his right-hand, and, with great dutifulness, led him
into the church as far as the altar. On the succeeding day, it
being the feast of Saint James and the second day of the "week,
the before-named emperor came to meet our lord the pope
outside of the church of Saint Mark, and, devoutly placing
himself at his right hand, led him into the church, and, the
service of the mass having been there celebrated, then con-
ducted him to the door of the said church ; and, while our lord
the pope was mounting his palfrey, the above-named emperor
held for him the stirrup, 4 and showed him all the honor and
reverence which his ancestors had been in the habit of show-
ing to the pope's predecessors.

At this council, also, John, abbat of Struma, who had been
styled pope Calixtus, and was the third and last anti-pope of
this schism, was degraded, and was rejected and renounced by
the emperor himself and all his principal men, both eccle-
siastics and seculars. In like manner, all the archbishops,
bishops, and abbats of the kingdom of Germany who had been
ordained either by him or by the other anti-popes, his prede-
cessors, namely, by Octavianus, who had been styled pope Vic-
tor, or by Guido de Crema, who had been styled pope Paschal,
were degraded. The altars, also, which had been consecrated
by them, or by those ordained by them, were destroyed. At this
council, also, Conrad, the brother of the above-named emperor,
received from the hands of pope Alexander the archbishopric
of Sanceburg, 5 together with the legateship of the whole king-
dom of Germany, to hold the same for life. Indeed, this Con-
rad, when in the time of the schism he had been elected arch-
Lishop of Mentz, refused to receive consecration from pope
Octavianus, but, preferring to live among Catholics in a state
of poverty for the name of Christ, rather than among schis-
matics be loaded with riches and transitory blessings, came
to pope Alexander at the city of Sens, by whom being kindly
received, he was made cardinal-bishop of Sabina ; and Chris-
tian, chancellor of the emperor, succeeding him as archbishop
of Mentz, received the pall from Guido of Crema, which he

mean a kind of ladder which was used in mounting a horse.

afterwards burned with his own hands, because he had re-
ceived it of him, and was absolved at Venice, at the llialto,
in the palace of the Patriarch, before pope Alexander and the
whole of the cardinals, and receiving the pall from Alexander,
continued to be archbishop of Mentz.

The Letter of pope Alexander to Richard, archbishop of Can-
terbury, and his suffragans, on the restoration of peace to the
Church.

"Alexander, the bishop, servant of the servants of God,
to his venerable brethren Eichard, archbishop of Canterbury,
and his suffragans, and his beloved sons the abbats appointed
in the archbishopric of Canterbury, and who especially belong
to the Roman Church, health and the Apostolic benediction.
We do give to Almighty God exceeding praise and thanks,
who, though He has for so long permitted the ship of Peter to
be tossed by the stormy tempests of the sea, has now at length
given His orders to the winds and the waves, and a great calm
has ensued, insomuch that, the waves of the raging sea being
appeased, the said ship has been brought into the haven of rest
and of safety. For our most dearly beloved son in Christ, Fred-
eric, the illustrious emperor of the Romans, on a day recently
past, being the Lord's day before the feast of Saint James, with
great devoutness came into our presence at Venice, attended
by the principal ecclesiastics and laymen of his realm, and
there, before an innumerable concourse of men and women,
who repeated his praises with the loudest acclamations, paid all
reverence and honor to ourselves as Supreme Pontiff; and on
the feast of Saint James, as we were going at his entreaty to the
church of Saint Mark for the purpose of celebrating the so-
lemnity of the mass, he came to meet us, and after the mass
was finished, which, unworthy as we are, he reverently heard
performed by us, he paid us all the honor which his ancestors
had been accustomed to shew unto our predecessors. On the
calends also of the present month of August, the before-named
emperor, in presence of a numerous multitude of persons,
caused oath to be made on his soul, 6 on which his chief men
who were then present, both ecclesiastics as well as laymen,
the said oath being administered, did confirm the same, to
the effect that he would for ever keep intact and inviolate

6 This peculiar kind of oath we learn was especially used by the early
kings of France.

the peace towards the Church, and for fifteen years towards our
most dearly beloved son in Christ, William, the illustrious king of
Sicily, and the truce with the Lombards from the aforesaid
calends of August for the space of six years in such manner
as the said peace and truce had been agreed upon, and arranged
and reduced to writing. Accordingly, in the same way that the
said emperor has received us as the Catholic pope and his spi-
ritual father, so do we acknowledge him as the Catholic emperor,
and his wife as the Catholic empress, and their son as the Catholic
king. Wherefore give thanks to our Creator who in His com-
passion has looked upon His spouse the Holy Church, and has
in the fulness of His grace, after the many persecutions by
which she has been grievously oppressed and crushed, restored
peace and quietness to her. Given at Yenice, at the Eialto, on
the eighth day before the ides of August."

Tl\e Letter of pope Alexander to Roger, archbishop of York, and
Hugh, bishop of Durham, on the peace made between himself
and the emperor.

11 Alexander, the bishop, servant of the servants of God,
to his venerable brethren, Roger, archbishop of York, and legate
of the Apostolic See, and Hugh, bishop of Durham, health and
the Apostolic benediction. The obedience you have manifested
in your most pleasing devotedness, and which you are known
to have displayed both duteously and laudably towards our-
selves and the Church, require that to you, as especial and
duteous spiritual sons of the Church, we should describe the
successes of the Church, inasmuch as it is worthy and becoming
and right that those whom we have found so firmly rooted
and established in duty towards us, we should render joyous
and pleased at our welfare and that of the Church. There-
fore, together with ourselves, give thanks to Almighty God who
dwells on high, and who from above looks down upon the lowly,
by whose bounty it has come to pass that His spouse the holy
Church, after being long and grievously tossed by stormy waves
and most mighty tempests, has now at length reached the
haven of safety ; and, the raging storms appeased, enjoys the
tranquillity her due, and so much longed for by her. For, on
the twelfth day before the calends of the present month
of August, by command of our most dearly beloved son in
Christ Frederic, the illustrious emperor of the Romans, the son

of the marquis Albert, a man of noble rank, great and power-
ful, and chamberlain of the emperor himself, in presence
of the principal ecclesiastics and laymen of the kingdom of
Germany, publicly made oath upon his soul, while touching
the holy Evangelists, in our presence and before an innumerable
concourse of persons, to the effect that after the said emperor
had come to Venice, all questions and disputes being set at
rest, he would make peace with the Church as the same had
been arranged and agreed upon by our brethren and his princi-
pal men, and peace with our most dearly beloved son in Christ
"William, the illustrious king of Sicily, for fifteen years, and a
truce with the Lombards for the space of six years, to be ratified
by oath upon his soul, as also by his principal men, according
to the contents of the charter containing the said treaties of
peace and truce. Also, the chief men of the kingdom of Ger-
many, namely, our venerable brethren the archbishops of Mag-
deburg and Cologne, and Christian, the so-called archbishop of
Mentz, and certain others, then made oath for themselves upon
their souls to the same effect. On the ninth day before the
calends of August the before-named emperor, as had been
arranged and agreed upon, came to the church of Saint Nicho-
las, which is one mile distant from Venice, where, both he,
as also the archbishops, bishops, and other principal men of
Germany, renouncing their schism, were thereby rendered de-
serving of the benefit of absolution at the hands of our brethren
the bishops and cardinals at our command, certain other persons
being there present. After this, they came to Venice, and
there before the church of Saint Mark the before-named em-
peror, in the presence of an innumerable concourse of men and
women, who returned thanks and rendered praises with the
loudest acclamations, humbly and reverently paid obedience
and respect to ourselves as Supreme Pontiff; and having re-
ceived from us the kiss of peace dutifully took his place at our
right hand, and with the respect and devotedness which was our
due, led us into the church as far as the altar. On the following
day, being the feast of Saint James, at the request of the said
emperor, we came to the aforesaid church of Saint Mark to
perform the solemnity of the mass, and on our arriving there
the before-named emperor came forth from the church to meet
us, and having dutifully taken his place at our right hand, led
us into the church, and after the celebration of the mass, walked

at our right hand to the door of the said church, and when we
mounted our palfrey which was there ready, held our stirrup
and showed us all the honor and respect which his ancestors
had been accustomed to show to our predecessors. It will,
therefore, be your anxiety to congratulate ourselves and the
Church upon our prosperity and success, and to impart the effects
of peace to the other devoted sons of the Church, in order that
those who are influenced by zeal for the house of the Lord may re-
joice and exult in the Lord for the gift of peace sent unto them
from above. Given at Venice, at the Rialto, on the seventh
day before the calends of August."

In the same year, Peter, cardinal priest, titular of Saint
Chrysogonus, and legate from the Apostolic See, formerly bishop
elect of the see of Meaux, came into France and received a
mandate from pope Alexander, that the whole of Normandy
and all the lands of the king of England on both sides of the
sea should be placed under interdict, unless he should allow his
son Richard, earl of Poitou, to marry Alice, the daughter of
Louis, king of France, whom the king of England had for a
long time, and beyond the period that had been agreed upon
between them, kept in his charge. "When this was understood
by the king of England, he appealed to the presence of our
lord the pope, in his own behalf and that of his territories, and
shortly after crossed over from England to Normandy, where
a conference was held between him and the king of France at
Ivery, on the eleventh day before the calends of October, in the
presence of the before-named cardinal and the chief men of
both kingdoms.

Here the king of England the father, by his people, plighted
his faith and caused oath to be made on his soul, 7 that his son
Richard, earl of Poitou, should be married to the before-named
Alice, if the king of France, the father of the young lady,
would give to the before-named Richard, earl of Poitou, the city
of Bourges with its appurtenances as his daughter's marriage
portion, according to the terms of the covenant that had been
made thereon between them, and would give to his son king
Henry the whole of the French portion of Veuilgesin, 8 namely,
the whole of the land that lies between Gisors and Pontoise,
\\hieh he had promised that he would give him as a marriage
portion with his daughter. But as the king of France declined

464 ANNALS OF ROGEE DE HOVEDE1T. A.D. 1177.

to give them up, the king of England would not allow his
son Richard to marry the before-named Alice. Neverthe-
less, at the said interview, by the advice of the cardinal and
the chief men of both kingdoms, friendship and a final recon-
ciliation were made between the king of France and the king
of England upon the following terms :

" Know all men, both present as well as to come, that I Louis,
by the grace of God king of the Franks, and I Henry, by the
like grace king of England, wish it to be understood by all
men, both present and to come, that we, by the inspiration of
God, have promised and made oath that we will go together,
in the service of Christianity, and assuming the cross will de-
part for Jerusalem, in manner contained in the instrument made
between us as to assuming the cross. We do also will that all
should know that we now are and henceforth wish to be friends,
and that each of us will, to the best of his power, defend life
and limb for the other, and his wordly honors against all men.
And if any person shall presume to do injury to either of us, I
Henry, to the best of my poAver, will aid Louis, king of France,
my liege lord, against all men ; and I Louis will, to the best of
my power, aid Henry, king of England, as my vassal and liege-
man, against all men ; saving always that faith which we owe
to our liegemen so long as they shall preserve their fealty to
ourselves. And from henceforth neither of us will harbour any
enemy of the other in his dominions, from the time that delivery
of him shall have been demanded. And to the end that hence-
forth all matter of discord between us may be removed, we do
mutually agree that as to the lands and possessions and other
things which each of us now possesses, the one shall from this
time forward make no demand thereof against the other, (ex-
cept Auvergne, as to which the dispute arose between us,
and except the fee of Chateau Raoul, and except some small
fees and allotments of lands belonging to us in Berry,) in
case our vassals should take any portion thereof the one from
the other or in opposition to either of us. And if, as to the
places which are above excepted, we shall not be able of our-
selves to come to an agreement, then I Louis, king of the Franks,
have chosen three bishops, those of Claremont, Nivernois and
Treguier, and three barons, count Theobald, count Robert,
and Peter de Courteney, 9 my ^brethren, and I Henry, king of
England, have chosen three bishops, William, "bishop of Le Mans,
'' Iiiconect.lv written in the text ' de Turtenei."



/.D. 1177- TKEATY BETWEEN KING LOUIS AND KING HENKY. 465

Peter, bishop of Perigord, and Robert, bishop of Nantes, and
three barons, Maurice de Croume, William Maingot, and Peter
de Montrabell, on my side. And the bishops before-named,
shall upon the word of truth assert, and the laymen shall
make oath, that they will diligently make inquisition into the
allegations made on either side, both through themselves and
through the oaths of the men of those districts, and that
whatever they shall learn as to the rights of each of us, the
same they will pronounce between us, and we will in good
faith strictly abide by their decision. But if all those bishops
whom I Louis have chosen, shall not be able to be present,
nevertheless we will abide by the decision of such two as
shall be present. And if all the barons who hare been named
on my side shall not be present, for all that we will not do
otherwise than abide by the decision of the other two who
shall be present. And in like manner it shall be as to those
whom I king Henry have chosen, both bishops as well as barons.
We have also made oath that we will do no injury to them be-
cause they shall have said the truth as to the said matters. And
if perchance, which God forbid, any dispute shall hereafter arise
between TIS as to our dominions, the same shall without delay
be settled by the same persons in good faith and without evil
intent. But if any one of the aforesaid persons shall in the
meantime chance to die, then another one shall be substituted in
his place. And if either of us, before assuming the cross,
shall wish to depart at an earlier period upon the journey,
the other who shall remain, shall faithfully protect and defend
the territories and subjects of him who shall have gone abroad,
as though they were his own and part of his own dominions.
And after we shall have, by the will of God, assumed the cross,
*we will cause our men who shall be with us to make oath that,
if either of us, which God forbid, shall die upon the road, then
in such case they will faithfully serve him who shall be sur-
viving, as they would have served their lord if he had been
living, so long as they shall think proper to remain in the land
of Jerusalem. The money of the deceased the survivor shall
keep, to perform the due services to Christianity, with the ex-
ception of that portion which, before setting out, the deceased
shall have ordered to be given to certain places and certain
persons. And if either of us shall depart this life, we will
appoint, if God shall indulge us with time sufficient, certain of

466 ANNALS OF EOGEB DE HOVEDKN. A.D. 1177.

our trustworthy and faithful subjects, to whom shall be en-
trusted the money of each of us for the performance of the due
services to Christianity, and who shall lead and govern our men.
Also, on assuming the cross, before we set out on the expedition,
we will cause those whom we shall appoint as guardians and
governors of our dominions, to make oath that they will, in
good faith and to the best of their power, if need shall be, assist
in defending the lands of each of us, whenever the same shall
be demanded in behalf of the other ; that is to say, that they
whom I Henry, king of England, shall appoint to govern my
dominions, shall to the utmost of their power assist in defend-
ing the lands of Louis, king of France, my liege lord, in
the same manner in which they would defend my own lands,
in case my city of Rouen were besieged ; and in like man-
ner that those whom I Louis, king of France, shall appoint
to govern my dominions, shall, to the utmost of their power,
assist in defending the lands of Henry, king of England, just
as they would defend my own lands if my city of Paris were
besieged. I do also will that merchants and all other men of
his dominions, both clergy as well as laity, shall, with all their
property, be secure, and enjoy peace in all my territories. And
I Henry, king of England, do in like manner will that mer-
chants and all other men, both clergy as well as laity, of the
dominions of the king of France, my liege lord, shall, with all
their property, be secure and enjoy peace in all my territories.
The above- written we have engaged strictly to observe, and
have sworn the same in the presence of the venerable Peter,
cardinal priest, titular of Saint Chrysogonus, legate of the
Apostolic See, and in the presence of Richard, bishop of Win-
chester, John, bishop of Chartres, Henry, bishop of Bayeux,
Froger, bishop of Seez, Gilles, bishop of Evreux, Henry,
king of Englacd, the son, earl Theobald, earl Robert, Peter de
Courtrai, Simon, earl of Evreux, William de Humezt, and many
others, both clergy and laity."

After the conference was concluded, Henry, king of Eng-
land, the father, came to Vernueil, and there, in order to gain
the Divine favour, and moved by the entreaties of the good men
of Grammont, 10 he enacted, in presence of Richard, bishop
of Winchester, Henry, bishop of Bayeux, Gilles, bishop
of Evreux, Froger, bishop of Seez, Simon, earl of Evreux,

A. D. 1177. EARLDOM OF MARCH SOLD TO KING HENRY. 467

Robert, earl of Leicester, and many other earls and barons
of his realm, that no one should for the debt of the superior
lord presume to take the property of the vassal, unless the
vassal should owe to him the same debt, or be security for the
same ; but that the rents which the vassals are bound to pay
to their superior lords, are to be paid to the creditors of their
lords, and not to the lords themselves. The rest, however,
of the property of the vassals was to remain their own and in
peace, and it should be lawful for no one to seize them
for the debts of their superior lords. This statute and custom
the king enacted, and ordered to be observed in all his vills and
everywhere throughout his realm ; namely, in Normandy, Aqui-
taine, Anjou, Maine, Touraine, and Brittany, as being universal
and established. And in order that the said statute might be
strictly observed and held as ratified, he ordered it to be
committed to writing and confirmed by the authority of his
own seal.

In the same year, on the fifth day before the calends of
October, being the third day of the week, Geoffrey, nephew of
Roger, archbishop of York, prior of Beverley, and chancellor
to the king of England, the son, master Robert le Grand,
and many others, in number three hundred men and women,
passing over in one and the same ship from England to Nor-
mandy, perished at sea near Saint Valery, on the coast of
Ponthieu. Shortly after, our lord, the king of England, the
father, entering Berry with a large army, captured Chateaxi
Raoul ; and when he was marching thence toward Castres, the
lord of that town came and met him on the road, and delivered
up to him the daughter of Raoul de Dol, whom the king gave
to Baldwin de Rivers, together with the honor of Chateau
Raoul.

After this, our lord, the king of England, the father, pro-
ceeded to Grammont, and Audebert, earl of March, came to
meet him there, and in presence of the archbishop of Bour-
deaux, John, bishop of Poitiers, and many other persons, both
clergy and laity, sold to the before-named king of England
the whole earldom of March for fifteen thousand pounds An-
jouin, twenty mules, and twenty palfreys, and by his charter
confirmed the same.

The Charter of Audebert, earl of March, made on the sale of his
earldom to Henry, Icing of England, the father.

"Be it known to all present, as well as to come, that I,
Audebert, earl of March, having lost my son, who was my sole
heir, and being thereby left to the inclination of my own will,
have, inasmuch as I have made a vow to devote myself for
ever hereafter to the service of God, made sale of the whole
of my lands, and whatever belonged to me by hereditary right,
to my lord Henry, the illustrious king of the English, no one
making objection to the same, (indeed there being no one what-
ever who could of right object thereto,) for fifteen thousand
pounds of money, Anjouin, paid down to me in full at Gram-
mont, twenty mules, and twenty palfreys. And further, I have
by my corporal oath, administered by the hands of "William,
archbishop of Bourdeaux, given security that I will guarantee to
my lord the king, and to his heir, the earl of Poitou, or to
whomsoever he shall give the same, the aforesaid lands, in
good faith and without evil intent, against all men, and that,
during the whole of my life, I will do nothing either by con-
tracting marriage or in any other way, to prevent the afore-
said sale from remaining inviolate. And to the end that this
my sale so solemnly made, may not possibly, by any malignity
hereafter, be rendered null and void, I have fortified the same
with my seal. Done publicly in the year from the Incarnation
of our Lord 1177, in the month of December, at Grammont, in
presence of the archbishop of Bourdeaux, John, bishop of Poitou,
and many others."

After these matters were transacted at Grammont, our lord,
the king of England, the father, received homage and the
oaths of fealty and allegiance from the barons and knights of
the earldom of March, and Audebert, the said earl of March,
departed thence with the above-mentioned sum of money which
had been paid him by the king of England.

In the same year, a great flood took place in Holland, the
embankments against the sea being burst asunder, and washed
away nearly the whole of the property in that province, and
drowned multitudes of people ; this took place on the seventh
day before the ides of January.

In the meantime, the abbat elect of the church of Saint



A.D. 1177. LETTEE OP POPE ALEXANDEB. 469

Augustin, at Canterbury, often and earnestly, both personally
and by other worthy men, as his mediators, entreated Richard,
archbishop of Canterbury, to come to the church of Saint
Augustin, to consecrate him as abbat thereof, to which the
archbishop made answer that it was not his duty to go thither
to consecrate him, but rather that he ought to come to the me-
tropolitan church of Canterbury, for the purpose of receiving
his benediction. In consequence of this dispute, the before-
named abbat elect appealed to the presence of our lord the
pope, and setting out for Rome,- obtained letters from Alex-
ander, the Supreme Pontiff, to the following effect :

The Letter of pope Alexander on lehalf of the abbat elect of the
church of Saint Augustin, at Canterbury.

"Alexander, the bishop, servant of the servants of God,
to his venerable brother Roger, bishop of Worcester, health and
the Apostolic benediction. Whereas we did some time since
give our commands to our venerable brotherRichard, archbishop
of Canterbury, legate of the Apostolic See, no longer to
defer bestowing the gift of consecration upon our dearly be-
loved son, the abbat elect of the church of Saint Augustin, in
his monastery, which, without any intermediate person, belongs
directly to the jurisdiction of the Church of Rome, and inas-
much as the archbishop refused to perform our commands, we
might of right have bestowed consecration upon the said abbat
elect, either ourselves or through another, who would not prove
so ready to oppose our wishes. Being desirous, however, more
fully to make trial in him of the virtue of obedience, after a long
discussion which the said archbishop has had in our presence,
by means of his envoys with the abbat elect, on the disputed
Joint as to the consecration, the same has, by the common con-
sent of our brethren, by their definite judgment, been thus de-
cided ; that the archbishop of Canterbury must, without exacting
obedience from him, and all opposition laid aside, consecrate both
him and his successors in the monastery of Saint Augustin. We
have accordingly, in conformity with the customary and abun-
dant considerateness of the Apostolic See, thought proper to send
back the said abbat elect to the aforesaid archbishop, to receive
from him the gift of consecration. Considering, therefore, the
labours and expenses which the said monastery has now for a
long time incurred upon this point, we do command your brother-



470 ANNALS OF ROGEB DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1178.

hood, by our precept in this our Apostolic writing conveyed,
and do by virtue of your obedience enjoin you, that, if the
said archbishop shall delay to consecrate the said abbat elect,
as directed by us, within the period by our letters appointed,
then, relying on our authorization, all excuses, opposition,
and appeal set aside, as soon as you shall be called upon
so to do, no decree, either of ourselves or of another, by which
it is ordered that the same shall be submitted to appeal, and no
letters that have been, or shall be obtained from us withstand-
ing, and no exception whatsoever thereto holding good, you shall,
without curtailment or delay, fulfil our commands. Given at
the Lateran, on the fifteenth day before the calends of May."

When the before-named archbishop of Canterbury heard
of this, he determined to go to the monastery of Saint Augustin
for the purpose of consecrating the said abbat elect, accord-
ing to the tenor of the mandate of the Apostolic See. Ac-
cordingly, on a certain day on which the said abbat elect was
travelling in another province upon the business of his house,
the archbishop came with a considerable retinue of his clergy
and laity to the monastery of Saint Augustin, asserting that
he had come thither for the purpose of consecrating the said
abbat elect, and on not finding him, appealed to our lord the
pope on behalf of himself and the dignity of his church. In
consequence of this, the abbat elect went to Rome, and re-
ceived the gift of benediction from pope Alexander.

In the year of grace 1178, which was the twenty-fourth
year of the reign of king Henry, son of the empress Matilda,
the said Henry was at the city of Anjou, on the day of the
Nativity of our Lord. In this year, the king of England, the
father, desired exceedingly to return to England, and send-
ing messengers to Louis, king of the Franks, obtained from
him letters of protection to the following effect:

" Louis, king of the Franks, to all to whom this present letter
shall come, greeting. Know all of you that we have taken into
our charge all the lands of Henry, king of England, our most
dearly beloved brother, that lie on this side of the sea, in case he
shall happen to cross over into England or go abroad, upon the
understanding that when his deputies from the lands beyond
sea shall call upon us so to do, we will with good faith and with-
out evil intent give them counsel and help for the defence and
protection of the said lands. Given at Vincennes."

In the meantime the Arian heresy which, as previously men-
tioned, had been condemned in the province of Toulouse, had
revived ; and this coming to the ears of the king of France
and the king of England, inflamed by zeal for the Christian
faith, they determined personally to go thither, in order that
they might entirely drive the before-named heretics from those
parts. However, after a short time had intervened, it seemed
to them that it might be more effectual if they sent thither
wise men to convert the heretics to the Christian faith by their
preaching and learning, than if .they themselves were to hasten
thither in person. For they were reminded of the words,
" "Tis enough to have commanded vengeance ; more will the
dread of your name effect than your sword; your presence
diminishes your fame." 11

They therefore sent thither Peter, cardinal priest, titular
of Saint Chrysogonus, and legate of the Apostolic See, the arch-
bishops of Bourges and Narbonne, Reginald, bishop of Bath,
John, bishop of Poitou, Henry, abbat of Clairval, and many
other ecclesiastics, in order that by their preaching they might
convert the said heretics to the Christian faith, or on reasonable
grounds prove them to be heretics, and separate them from the
threshold of holy mother Church and from communion with the
faithful. In addition to this, the before-named kings chose
Raymond, count of Toulouse, the viscount of Touraine, Ray-
mond of Neufchatel, 12 and other influential men, and ordered
them to act as assessors to the above-named cardinal and his
associates in the faith of Christ, and to expel the said heretics
from those parts by the power of their might.

Accordingly, when the before-named cardinal and the other
Catholic persons had entered Toulouse, they found there a certain
wealthy man, who possessed two castles, one within the city
and the other without the walls of the city, who, before their
coming, had confessed himself to be a sectary of the heretical
corruption ; but now, moved by terror, and desiring to screen
this execrable sect, made pretence that he was a Christian.
When the cardinal came to know this, he ordered the said
wealthy person to be brought before him ; on whose coming
for the purpose of making confession of his faith, he was found
to be in every article an antagonist of the Christian religion.

11 " Vindictam mandasse sat est, plus nominis horror
Quam tuus ensis aget : minuit praesentia famam."
12 In France.



472 AlfSALS OF PvOGEil DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1178.

Accordingly, he was pronounced by the aforesaid cardinal and
the bishops who were with him a manifest heretic, and con-
demned; and they gave orders that his property should be con-
fiscated, and that the castles which he possessed, lofty and
of great beauty, should be levelled with the ground. Upon
seeing himself thus condemned, and his property confiscated,
ho came to the cardinal and the bishops, his associates, and
prostrating himself at their feet, asked pardon, and, penance
being enjoined him, was led naked and scourged through the
streets and lanes of the city. After this, he swore that he
would go to Jerusalem, and remain there three years in the
service of God, and if after the said three years he should
return home, his possessions were to be restored to him, on
condition, however, that his castles should be levelled, in
testimony of his heretical depravity ; he was also to give to
the count of Toulouse five hundred pounds of silver.

On these things taking place, many of the heretics, fearing
lest they might be dealt with in a similar manner, came to the
cardinal and his associates, and secretly confessing their errors
and asking pardon, obtained mercy. In the meanwhile, it
came to their ears, that certain false brethren, namely, Ray-
mond, Bernard, the son of Raymond, and certain other here-
siarchs, transforming themselves into angels of light, while
they were those of Satan, and preaching what was con-
trary to the Christian faith, led astray the minds of many by
their false preaching, and had dragged them with themselves to
hell. These being summoned to come into the presence of
the cardinal and his associates, for the purpose of making con-
fession of their faith, made answer that they would come be-
fore them if they should have a safe conduct in going and
returning.

A safe conduct, in going and returning, being accordingly
given to them, they came before the above-named cardinal,
and the bishops, barons, clergy and people who were pre-
sent, and produced before them a certain paper in which
they had written down the articles of their faith. On their
reading this at length, there seemed to be in it certain ex-
pressions of a suspicious nature, which, unless more fully
expressed, might possibly conceal the heresy they had preach-
ed. When one of them attempted to explain the articles
so written, and to speak in Latin, he was barely able to






A.D. 1178. THE HERETICS' DEFENCE. 473

connect two words, being utterly ignorant of the Latin
language. Upon this, it was necessary for the cardinal and
the bishops to bring themselves more on a level with them,
and, in consequence of their ignorance, to use the vulgar tongue.
Accordingly, on being examined as to the articles of the Chris-
tian faith, they made answer as to all the articles of the faith as
soundly and as circumspectly as if they had been most sincere
Christians.

Upon the count of Toulouse and others, who had formerly
heard them preach what was contrary to the Christian faith,
hearing this statement from them, being struck with the great-
est astonishment and inflamed with zeal for the Christian faith,
they arose and most clearly convicted them to their faces of
having lied ; saying that they had heard from some of them
that there were two Gods, the one good, and the other bad, the
good one having made only things invisible, and which cannot
be changed or corrupted, the bad one the heavens, the earth,
man and the other things visible. Others again affirmed that
they had heard at their preaching, that the body of Christ was
not made by the ministration of a priest who was unworthy, or
who had been convicted of any crime. Others also stated that
they had heard them say, in their preaching, that a man and
his wife could not be saved if the conjugal debt was satisfied.
Others again said that they had heard from them that baptism
was of no use to infants, and the utterance of numerous
other blasphemies against God and the holy Church and the
Catholic faith, which, by reason of their abominable enormity,
it is better to be silent upon than to disclose.

The heretics, however, contradicted these matters, and said
that they had given false testimony against them. For they
>said publicly, in presence of the before-named cardinal
and bishops, and all the people there present, and made con-
fession, and stoutly asserted, that there is but one God most
high, who has made all things visible and invisible, and en-
tirely denied that there were two first principles of things.
They also confessed that the priest, whether good or bad,
whether just or unjust, and whether such a character that
they knew him beyond doubt to be an adulterer or criminal
in other respects, was able to make the body and blood of
Christ, and that, through the ministration of a priest of this
character, and by virtue of the Divine words which were pro-



474 ANNALS OF ROGEB DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1178.

nounced by the Lord, the bread and wine were really changed
in substance into the body and blood of Christ. They also
asserted that infants or adults baptized with our baptism are
saved, and that without the said baptism no one can be saved,
together denying that they used any other kind of baptism or
imposition of hands, as had been imputed to them. In ad-
dition to this, they declared their belief, that a man and
woman united in marriage, in case no other sin prevented it,
would be saved, even though they should carnally satisfy the
conjugal debt, being excused by virtue of their marriage, and
that by reason thereof they are not damned.

They affirmed also, that archbishops, bishops, priests,
monks, canons, hermits, recluses, Templars, and Hospitallers,
would be saved. They also said, that it was becoming and
proper that those who entered churches founded in honor of
God and of the Saints, should approach them with the great-
est devoutness, and, showing to their priests and other minis-
ters honor and respect, should as a matter of duty pay them their
first fruits and^tithes, and make answer dutifully and faith-
fully on all parochial matters. They also laudably asserted,
among other things, that alms ought to be given both to
churches and to the poor, and indeed to every one who sought
them.

Although they were said to have previously denied all
these points, still they asserted that they did, according to a
sound understanding, understand the same; on which the be-
fore-named cardinal and bishops ordered that they should
swear that they believed in their hearts as they had con-
fessed with their lips. But they, like men of distorted minds
and crooked intentions, were at length unwilling to abandon
their heresy, where any semblance of authority seemed to aid
their crass and drowsy intellects, using as an excuse the words
which the Lord is mentioned in the Gospel as having used ;
" Swear not at all, but let your words be yea, yea, nay, nay," 13
and asserting that they ought not to swear ; whereas the Lord Him-
self is often read of as having sworn, as it is written ; " The
Lord hath sworn and will not repent ;" 14 and again, the Lord
says, " I have sworn by myself." 15 The Apostle also says, " An.
oath for confirmation is the end of all strife." 16 But they,
like idiots, not understanding the Scriptures, fell into the snare
13 Matt. v. 34. 14 Psalm ex. 4. Heb. vii. 10. 13 Isai. xlv. 23. 1S Heb. vi. 16.



A. D. 1178. CONVICTION OF THE HERETICS. 475

which they had concealed, for whereas they at first ahhorred
an oath as being an execrable thing and forbidden by the
Lord, they were, by the paper of their confession, convicted
of having sworn as they had said, "We do believe in the
truth, which is God, and do say that this is our belief;"
not being aware that to adduce the truth and the word of God
in testimony of the truth of their assertion, is beyond a
doubt taking an oath ; as we read of the Apostle, when he
says, " For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord," 17
and again, " God is my witness ;" 18 and as other passages
of a like nature prove, which can be easily found by those who
understand, and have read, the Holy Scriptures.

When, therefore, they had been convicted by many and
competent witnesses, and many persons were still preparing
to bear witness against them, because the Church is not wont
to deny the bosom of mercy to those who return thereto,
they carefully warned them, laying aside all heretical corrup-
tions, to return to the unity of the faith. They also advised
them, as they had been excommunicated by our lord the pope,
and the before-named cardinal, and the archbishops of Bourges
and Narbonne, and the bishop of Toulouse, on account of their
perverse preaching and schism, to come to be reconciled to
the Catholic faith, according to the forms prescribed by the
Church. This, however, being warped into tortuous ways and
hardened by abandoned habits, they refused to do, on which
the said cardinal, and the above-mentioned bishops, to-
gether with the before-named bishop of Poitiers, and the other
religious men who had assisted them throughout, in the sight
of the whole people, with lighted candles 19 again denounced
them as excommunicated, and condemned them, together with
their prompter, the devil, and gave orders to all the faithful in
Christ, thenceforth cautiously to avoid the before-named Ray-
mond and Bernard, and their accomplices, as persons excom-
municated, and handed over to Satan ; and that if at any time
in future they should preach to them any thing else than what
they had confessed in their hearing, they should reject their
preaching as false, and contrary to the Catholic and Apostolic
faith, and drive them as heretics and forerunners of Anti-

>7 1 Thess. iv. 15. 18 Rom. i. 9.

sentence being pronounced, the candles were extinguished.

christ to a distance from their territories. Moreover, the count
of Toulouse, and the other more influential men of the pro-
vince, in presence of all the people, gave assurance on
oath, that from that time forward they would neither, for
entreaty nor for money, support the heretics. Accordingly,
the before-named cardinal wrote to all the sons of holy mother
Church, to the following effect :

The Letter of Peter, titular of Saint Chrysogonus, cardinal
priest, and legate of tJie Apostolic See,

" Peter, by the grace of God, titular of Saint Chrysogonus,
cardinal priest, and legate of the Apostolic See, to all the sons
of holy mother Church, who preserve. the Catholic and Apos-
tolic faith, health in the Lord. The Apostle bears witness
that as there is but one God, so is there known to be but one
faith, from the soundness whereof no one can possibly without
peril wander astray. The foundations thereof, than which
no one can possibly lay any other, the Apostles and the Apos-
tolic men their successors, have, by the inspiration and teach-
ing of the Holy Ghost, so firmly and so circumspectly laid with
sound doctrines, as though with natural stones, that neither
the blasts of the roaring north wind, nor the engines of the
impious, even with repeated assaults, can overthrow them,
or in any way move them from the firmness of their position.
Consequently, although in these days certain false brethren,
namely, Raymond de Baimiac, and Bernard, the son of Ray-
mond, and certain other heresiarchs, transforming themselves
into angels of lights, whereas they are those of Satan, for some
time past preaching what is contrary to the Christian and
Apostolic faith, have, by their poisonous doctrines, deceived the
souls of many, and dragged them with themselves to perdi-
tion ; more recently, however, He who unveils mysteries, and
who gave His spirit to Daniel to confound the elders of Israel,
having respect for the souls deceived by the guiles of the devil,
has been unwilling that their perfidiousness should be any longer
hidden, or that the purity of the Christian doctrines should by
their preaching be corrupted ; and by His wonderful power,
many hearing and seeing the same, has revealed the venom of
their perfidiousness which had been previously concealed, to the
increase and glory of the Christian faith. For lately, the afore-
said Raymond and Bernard and others met our reverend brother



A.D. 1178. THE LETTER OF THE LEGATE PETER. 477

Reginald, bishop of Bath, and the noble men the viscount of
Touraine, and Raymond of Neufchatel, who by our advice
had come to the territory of Roger de Bediers, for the pur-
pose of obtaining the liberation of our venerable brother the
bishop of Alby, and asserted that they were unjustly treated
by the noble man the count of Toulouse and other barons who
had for ever abjured them ; on which occasion, on their pro-
posing to come into our presence for the defence of their faith if
they could have a safe conduct in coming and returning, the said
bishop and viscount, fearing lest this stumbling-block might not
be revealed to the hearts of the simple, who were imbued with
their abominations, and lest they might ascribe it to our dis-
trustfulness if a hearing were refused them, on our behalf and
that of the before -named count, granted them the said indul-
gence, in order that in full security they might present them-
selves before us, that in the hearing of ourselves and our
venerable brother the bishop of Poitiers, the legate of the Apos-
tolic See, and of other discreet men, and of the whole people, they
might be examined, and, if their belief were sound and proper,
be approved of by us ; and in order that, after being examined
by us, they might still return in security to their homes, that
so they might not appear to have been induced by any fear or
violence to make confession of the true faith; but however, upon
the understanding that if within eight days from the time that
our edict had gone forth, they should not have returned to the
true faith, they were to be expelled from the territories of the
noble men who had abjured them. We therefore thought
proper to ratify the indulgence so granted them by the bishop
and viscount ; although, as we have mentioned, an edict had
already gone forth from the aforesaid count of Toulouse and
other noble men, that they should be expelled from their ter-
ritories ; and, the said bishop of Poitiers and the before-named
count of Toulouse, and other clergy and laymen, about three
hundred in number, being assembled with us in the church of
Saint Stephen, we enjoined them to explain to us their belief,
and, returning to the truth of the Catholic faith, by a healthful
confession of the true faith, to remove the infamy which both
the whole land and they themselves had by their damnable
doctrines incurred. On this, during the conversation that
ensued on both sides, they produced a certain paper in which
they had written out the articles of their faith, and read it at
length just as written. On our detecting in it some expres-



478 ANNALS OF EOGER DE HOVEDEH". A.D. 1178.

sions which seemed to be of a suspicious nature, and which
might, unless more fully explained, conceal the heresy which they
had preached, we requested them to answer and defend their
faith in the Latin tongue ; both because their language was
not sufficiently understood by us, and because the Gospels and
Epistles, on which alone they were willing to ground their
belief, are known to be written 20 in the Latin tongue. When
they found that they could not venture to do this, being en-
tirely ignorant of the Latin language, as appeared by the words
of one of them, who, when he attempted to speak in Latin, was
hardly able to join two words, and entirely failed ; it became
necessary for us to stoop to their level, and, absurd as it was,
by reason of their ignorance to discourse in the vulgar tongue
about the Sacraments of the Church. On this, making denial
that there were two first principles of things, they publicly, in
the presence of ourselves and the before-named persons, made
confession and stoutly asserted that there is one God most high,
who has made all things, visible and invisible, which they
also proved to be true by the writings of the Evangelists and
Apostles. They also confessed that our priest, whether good
or bad, just or unjust, and whether even of such a charac-
ter that they knew him, beyond doubt, to be an adulterer,
or guilty of any other crime, was able to make the body and
blood of Christ, and that through the ministration of such a
priest, and by virtue of the Divine words, which were pro-
nounced by the Lord, the bread and wine were truly changed
in substance into the body and blood of Christ. They also as-
serted that infants or adults when baptized with our baptism
are saved, and that without the said baptism no one can be
saved, utterly denying that they had any other baptism or
imposition of hands, as was imputed to them. They further
asserted their belief that a man and woman united in marriage,
in case no other sin prevented it, would be saved although
they should satisfy the conjugal debt, being excused by virtue
of their marriage, and that by reason thereof they are
not damned. They affirmed also that archbishops, bishops,
priests, monks, canons, recluses, Templars, and Hospitallers
would be saved. They also said that it was becoming and
proper, that t'hose who entered churches founded in honor of
God and of the Saints, should approach them with the greatest
devoutness, and, showing to the priests and other ministers
io He alludes to the Latin translation in the Vulgate.

honor and respect, should dutifully pay them their first-
fruits and tithes, and make answer dutifully and faithfully on
all parochial matters. They also laudahly asserted, among
other things, that alms ought to be given both to the churches
and to the poor, and indeed to every one who sought them. 21
Although they were said to have previously denied all these
points, still they asserted that they did, according to our sound
understanding, understand the same. After they had been
thus examined by us, and had of their own accord made the
confessions already mentioned, .we entered the church of Saint
James ; where, together with ourselves, an innumerable con-
course of people, which had flocked together, as though to
witness a spectacle, heard the confession of their faith read in
the vulgar tongue, the same having been written out in the
said tongue. After this, when, with all patience and without
any tumult, they had been listened to by us and all the people
there assembled, and had of their own accord made an end of
speaking, inasmuch as the exposition of their faith seemed quite
praiseworthy and orthodox, we again asked them in the hear-
ing of all the people, if they believed in their hearts what
they had confessed with their lips, and if at any time they
had preached the contrary thereof, as they had been often
charged with doing. They making answer that they did so
believe, and further denying that they had ever preached to
any other effect, the noble man the count of Toulouse and many
others, clergy as well as laymen, who had heard them preach
what was contrary to the Christian faith, being struck with
the greatest astonishment, and inflamed with zeal for the
Christian faith, arose and most clearly convicted them to their
faces of having lied. Some in fact steadily asserted that they
had heard from some of them, that there were two Gods, the
one good and the other bad ; the good one having only made
things invisible, and which cannot be changed or corrupted ;
the bad one, the heavens, the earth, man and the other things
visible. Others again affirmed that they heard at their preach-
ing, that the body of Christ was not made by the ministration
of a priest who was unworthy, or who had been convicted of
any crime. Many in like manner bore witness that they had
heard them utterly deny that a man and his wife could be
saved, if the conjugal debt were satisfied by them. Others

former is clearly the right reading.



480 AlTNAiS OF EOGER DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1178.

again stoutly maintained to their faces, that they had heard
from them that baptism was of no use to infants, and the ut-
terance of numerous other blasphemies against God and the
Holy Church and the Catholic faith, which, by reason of their
abominable enormity, we would rather be silent upon than
disclose. But, 22 whatever they stated in their former confes-
sion, which seemed to be sufficient unto salvation; if they did
believe the same in heart, and did so affirm with all their
heart, still, like men of distorted minds, and of crooked inten-
tions, they were at length unwilling to abandon their heresy,
when any seeming authority seemed to aid their crass and
drowsy intellects, using as an excuse the words which our Lord
is mentioned in the Gospel as having used ; 'Swear not at all, but
let your words be yea, yea, nay, nay ;' and asserting that Jthey
ought not to swear, whereas the Lord Himself is often read of as
having sworn, as it is written, ' The Lord hath sworn and
will not repent ;' and again the Lord says, ' I have sworn by
myself.' The Apostle also says, ' An oath for confirmation is the
end of all strife.' Many other passages also are found to pre-
sent themselves to those who read the holy Scriptures, to the
like effect ; in which, by reason of the infirmity of nature, we
are allowed to make an use of oaths to those whom we would
persuade to anything. However, like idiots, not understand-
ing the Scriptures, they fell into the snare which they had con-
cealed ; for whereas they at first abhorred an oath as being an
execrable thing, and forbidden by the Lord, they were, by the
very paper of their confession, convicted of having sworn,
as they had said, ' We do believe in the truth, Avhich is God,
and do say that this is our belief;' not being aware that to
adduce the truth and the word of God in testimony of the truth
of their assertion, is beyond a doubt taking an oath ; as we
read of the Apostle, when ho says, ' For this we say unto
you by the word of the Lord ;' and again, ' God is my wit-
ness ;' and as other passages of a like nature prove, which
can be easily found by those who understand, and have read,
the holy Scriptures. When therefore they had been convicted
by many and competent witnesses, and many persons were
still preparing to bear witness against them ; because the
Church was not wont to deny the bosom of mercy to those who
return thereto, we carefully warned them, laying aside all

heretical corruptions, to return to the unity of the faith ; and
advised them, as they had been excommunicated by our lord the
pope, the archbishops of Bourges and Narbonne, and the bishop
of Toulouse, by reason of their perverse preaching and schism,
to come to us to be reconciled to the Catholic faith, according
to the forms prescribed by the Church. This however, being
warped into tortuous ways, and hardened by abandoned habits,
they refused to do, on which, in the sight of the whole people,
who with one voice shouted assent thereto and exclaimed
against them with great fury, with lighted candles we again
denounced them as excommunicated, being joined therein by
the bishop of Poitou before-mentioned, and other religious
men who had supported us throughout, and condemned them
together with their prompter, the devil. Wherefore we do
warn the whole of you, and do exhort you in the Lord, and
do for the remission of your sins enjoin you henceforth carefully
to avoid the before-named Raymond and Bernard and their ac-
complices, as persons excommunicated and handed over to
Satan ; and if, at any time in future, they shall presume to
preach to you anything else than what they have expressed in
our presence to the effect above- written, you are to reject
their preaching as false and contrary to the Catholic and
Apostolic faith, and to drive them as heretics and forerun-
ners of Antichrist, from any intercourse with yourselves in
your uprightness, and to a distance from your territories.

The Letter of Henry, abbat of Clairval, on the same subject.

" Give ear, ye heavens, to our lamentations, let the earth
learn the grief of our heart. Let Catholic Christians bewail
the lot of Christ, and let the faithful people weep for the sor-
rows of their faith. Let all nations of the earth and sons of
men deplore the injury done to the salvation of mankind, and
let the universal sorrow of our lives be universally mourned
by all living men. In our day a new Philistine is arrayed
against the squadrons of Israel, a band of heretics, an army of
perverts, who irreverently insult the troops of the living God,
and with the highest presumption blaspheme the majesty of
the Lord. Why dost thou hesitate, David ? Why dost thou
tremble, thou faithful man ? Take up thy sling and thy stone ;
instantly be the blasphemer smitten on the forehead, and let
the wicked head which is shamelessly exalted be raised on the

point of his own sword by thy hands. For if in this contest
the portion of Christ is conquered, or if in the slightest degree
or in the smallest point mother Church is trodden under foot,
we know for certain that the cause is not wanting in goodness
but in defenders ; we know also that the triumph will not be
denied to our champion, if when fighting he wages the war-
fare inspired by love of the faith. Bui inasmuch as, accord-
ing to the word of truth, ' The harvest is plenteous and the la-
bourers are few,' the ravagers, good Jesus, of Thy fields, being
arrayed as deceitful labourers, think if they shall enter boldly,
by their ravages, as it were, to forestall the day of gathering
in thy harvest, and rather to root up what is unripe than to
reap what has attained maturity : where, then, are Thy hus-
bandmen appointed by Thee over Thy fertile and pleasant field,
blossoming with Thy blood, and watered with the sprinkling
thereof? Let them arise and assist us, and let them shield us
in our necessity, and oppose themselves as a wall of defence
for us against these blood-stained beasts. Arise, I say, arise,
husbands, fathers, leaders of nations, princes of the people,
drive away these vilest of savage brutes, which we have beheld,
which we point out, or at least expel these cubs of foxes; and
yet it is better to take them, but who is fitted so to do ? They
have no certain paths, they walk along winding ways, and
these most savage monsters are hidden in a kind of laby-
rinth made by their own frauds. Like a fawn they make their
escape from the hand, and are like unto writhing serpents ;
the more tightly you grasp them, the more easily do they slip
away. Thanks to God, however, that, although they cannot
be taken, they may be driven away, that so when they have
failed in the exertions they were making against us, they may
be confounded and perish of themselves. And, that this can
easily be effected, we will prove by things that we have beheld,
and in which we have taken part ; so that if, from this time
forward, it is not done, we shall have to deplore, not so much
their wickedness as our own short-comings, and the negligence
of our people. For it lately happened that, at the command
of our lord the pope, and at the exhortation of the most pious
princes, Louis, king of the Franks, and Henry, king of the
English, the lord Peter, the legate of the Apostolic See, and
the venerable men the bishops of Poitou and Bath, and our-
selves, went to Toulouse, a city in their county, which, as it
was stated to be a city containing a vast multitude, was also said



A. D. 1178. LETTER 0V HEXBY, ABI5AT OF CLAIRVA1. 483

to be the mother of heresy and the fountain-head of error.
Accordingly, we went to her, that we might learn if her
pangs justified the waitings that were raised. And, behold !
her wound was found to be exceeding great, BO much so, that
from the sole of her foot to the crown of her head, there was
hardly any soundness in her. For, in truth, not a third part
had been told us of all her wicked abominations, which that
noble city was cherishing in the bosom of her unbelief. The
abomination of desolation had found a place in her, and the
likeness of the reptiles described" by the prophets found a re-
fuge in her lurking-places. Heretics were there acting the
governor over the people, ruling over the clergy, to such a de-
gree that it made true the saying, ' Like people like priest ; >22
and the very life of the pastor was formed for the destruc-
tion of the flock. The heretics spoke, and all were in admira-
tion ; a Catholic spoke, and they would say, ' Who is this ?'
making it a miracle and a matter for amazement if there was
any one among them who should dare even to whisper any-
thing about the Word of truth. So greatly did this pestilence
prevail upon the earth, that they had made for themselves not
only priests and bishops, but they had even evangelists, who,
corrupting and cancelling evangelical truth, forged new gospels
for them, and, seducing the people, preached unto them new
dogmas from the wickedness of their hearts. I am guilty of
falsehood if there was not among them a certain aged man, of
considerable aifluence, blessed with brethren and friends, and
withal among the greatest of the city a great man, whom the
devil had so blinded with sin, urging him on, that he declared
himself to be Saint John the Evangelist, and would separate
the Word that in the beginning was with God, from the other
Rrst principle of created things, as though from another God.
He was the head of the doomed ones in this city, and the chief
of the heretics ; and though, a layman and illiterate, he knew
nothing at all, still, like a very fountain of diabolical wisdom,
he showered forth among them the streams, bitter as gall, of per-
dition and of death. Of a night there resorted to him the owls
that love darkness, on which, he, clothed in a kind of garment
made like a dalmatic, would take his seat among them, like a
king with his army standing around him, and become a preacher
to the senseless creatures. The whole city he had quite filled

484 AlfNALS OF BOGER DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1178.

with his disciples and his doctrines ; so much so that, through fear
of him, no one in the city dared offer any resistance to him.
Even upon our entry into the city, such great licence did the
heretics everywhere enjoy, that even, going straight before us
along the streets and lanes, they would laugh in their sleeves,
and point us out with remarks and their fingers ; crying out
that we were apostates, hypocrites, heretics. But in process
of time, and on a respite being afforded us, in a few days one of
us was enjoined to use the words of exhortation, and to discourse
on the rule of faith before the infidel multitude. Wherefore,
on using orthodox discourse in preaching to the people, the
sinners were alarmed in Sion, and trembling came upon the
hypocrites ; so much so, that they who before had closed the
mouths of the speakers, now did not dare to appear before the
speakers. One seeing or hearing might instantly have ob-
served foxes transformed into moles, and whereas hitherto
they had with impunity run to and fro before the public, now
they dived down into their hiding-places in the ground, and
into their subterranean cells, in order that, in the bowels of
the earth, they might gnaw and destroy the sacred plants,
which they now no longer dared openly to crop. But, lest
this leopard of various colours might betray himself by the
spots on his skin, by their crafty inventions they adopted a
wicked mode of expression, in order that, on being brought to
the test of discussion, for the purpose of aping our confirmed
belief in the true faith, they might lyingly assert that they
believe whatever we believe. From that day, therefore, our
lord the legate and the rest of us who thought fit to meet these
wild beasts openly, for the purpose of making examination of
those whom fear and confusion had thrust down grovelling
into the very centre of the earth, turned our whole attention,
and used all our endeavours that, even by compulsion, they
should come forth into public, and, in the light, reject the
works of darkness. Accordingly, it came to pass that, by
command of the legate, the bishop made oath, as also some
of the clergy and the chief men of the city, and other
men in the city who were attached to the true faith, and whom
no manner of perfidy on their part had as yet aspersed, that they
would give to us in writing the names of all whom they had
hitherto known or might happen to know in future, who were
accomplices in, or promoters of, this heresy, and would spare no

one whatever either for favour or reward, or on account of
any tie of relationship. When therefore an innumerable
multitude was duly entered upon this list so drawn up, among
others there was named this great man, Peter Moran, whom,
as we have previously mentioned, they called Saint John the
Evangelist. Accordingly, taking counsel together with reference
to him, we determined with him to commence our judgment, that
the rest of the perfidious multitude might tremble, when the
simplicity of the true Gospel had brought to condemnation the
craftiness of the false evangelist. Sending therefore his
apparitors, the earl of Saint Gilles, who faithfully gave us his
assistance, ordered him to be summoned. He however, trusting
in the multitude of his riches, and the numbers of his rela-
tions, set at nought the words of the first citation, by making
some trifling and arrogant excuse for creating delay. Conse-
quently, on a second day the earl, relying more on blandishments
than terror, in a quiet way invited the said Peter by means of
his friends and acquaintances ; and, after he had made many
difficulties as to coming, mingling threats with blandish-
ments, at last brought him before us. Upon this, one of us
who was the speaker, began to warn him in such terms as
these : ' Well now, Peter, your fellow-citizens accuse you of
having broken the rule of the true faith, and having entered
upon the corruptions of the Arian heresy ; nay, more, you both
lead others, and are being led yourself by others through the
devious paths of multiplied errors.' Upon this, heaving a
deep sigh, and inwardly touched with a pang at his heart, he
lyingly asserted at the first blush that he was none of that
sort. On being asked whether he would prove this on oath, he
contended that credence ought be given to his simple assertion
as that of a faithful and noble man. When, however, we all
persisted in exacting the oath, he promised that he would swear
forthwith, for fear lest he might by that very circumstance be
detected to be a heretic, in case he should remain obstinate in
declining the oath, which refusal was in conformity with the
tenets of this heresy. Accordingly, shortly afterwards the relics
of the saints were with due honor produced and received with
such solemn reverence and devotion, so much so, that the faithful
among the people were moved to tears, and their hiding-places
had more charms for the heretics who had assembled than such
a sight. During the chaunt, which we sang, shedding plenteous



486 ANNALS OF ROGER DE HOTEDEN. A.D. 1178.

tears, to invoke the presence of the Holy Ghost, an evident
tremor and paleness came over the said Peter ; insomuch, that
both the colour of his countenance forsook him, and his strength
of mind departed. For how, on the approach of the Holy Ghost,
was any spirit to remain in its adversary ? You might have
seen the man shaking as though with a paralytic attack, no
longer retaining his power of language nor his senses, although
he was said by all to be a person of such great eloquence that
he had been accustomed to excel all others in speaking. Why
say more ? All standing by, the unhappy man making oath
that he would explain the truth as to his belief on all the
articles of faith on which we should question him, a wondrous
thing took place, and one in such a scene most agreable, by
reason of the pious delight it afforded us. The book was
open upon which he had sworn ; and one of the persons stand-
ing by, as a sort of pious amusement desiring to obtain a
presage of what was to come by means of the expression he
should hit upon, the following text of Scripture met his
view : ' What have we to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of
God ? Hast thou come to torment us before the time ?' ^
Truly, Lord Jesus, they had nothing to do with Thee, whom
the heavenly Father had cut off from the true vine as un-
fruitful branches, and had thrown abroad that they might
wither away ! But with us, who were assembled in Thy
name, the increase of our gladness was multiplied, and the
glories of Thy might resounded in thanksgivings and in the voice
of praise. At length, Peter was simply required on the strength
of his oath to confess to us his belief as to the sacrament of the
altar without any concealment thereon ; however, he did not
with his lips confess to the court for the purpose of procuring
safety that which he did not believe in his heart ; but on the
contrary, whereas he had made a determination to lie on all
points, he made a true disclosure of his own falseness ; and by
a new doctrine of his, proceeded to assert that the holy bread
of eternal life, when consecrated by the ministration of the
priest with the word of God, does not become the body of the
Lord. Upon this, all arose, overwhelming him in a manner with
the tears, which his contempt for the sacraments of Christ pro-
duced, and the Christian compassion that was felt for the
wretched man, summoned forth. No more was needed. They

A U. 1178. LKTTEB OF HENET, ABBAT OF CLAIKVAL. 487

gave their answer to the earl ; he was adjudged to be guilty of
heresy, and immediately, with the most positive promises on
the part of his relations, was consigned to the public place
of confinement. Rumours of what had happened flew through
the streets and suburbs of this most extensive city. The
mouths of the faithful were opened, and the lips of the Catholic
people were unsealed, Christ, to thy praises ; then for the first
time, as it were, did the brightness of faith burst forth in that
city, and the state that had so shortly before been despaired of,
breathed again to entertain hopes of everlasting salvation.
From that moment the word of God waxed stronger, and was
daily multiplied ; so that the whole face of the city seemed
more joyous, in that it emerged from the darkness of error
into the brilliancy of the light of truth. In the meantime,
Peter, coming to himself, and being moved by the Lord who
looked down upon him, on seeing that he was worthy of death
in this as well as in a future world, having sent many media-
tors, asked to be allowed the means of making satisfaction, and
promised to show the fruits of conversion, if he should be libe-
rated from the fear of impending death to the profitable enjoy-
ment of a better mode of life. He came accordingly, was re-
ceived by us, and was placed in sight of the contrite people
with his body naked, thus putting off the corruption of his
former infidelity. There, in the presence of all, he acknow-
ledged himself a heretic, there, by his hands, he plighted his
faith, there, he renounced his errors ; there, giving his right
hand, he made oath in the presence of all, and gave sureties
to the earl, as well as the knights and his principal fellow-
citizens, that he would submit himself to eveiy mandate
of my lord the legate, and would in all things obey his com-
n mnds. Upon this, proclamation was made to the people that
they were all to meet on the following day, at the church of
Saint Saturninus, to hear and to see in solemn form what
mode of penance the said Peter would have enjoined upon
him to perform. Accordingly, on the following day, as they
had been warned, all met together, and such a multitude, such
dense crowds, that, without excessive squeezing, there hardly
remained within the very horns of the altar a vacant place for
my lord the legate when celebrating the solemn service of
the mass. And, behold ! in the presence of this multitude so
vast, Peter, who was now in our hands, was led through the



488 ANNALS OF ROGER DE HOVEDEIT. A.D. 1178.

doors of the church naked and without shoes, the hishop of
Toulouse and the abbat of Saint Saturninus scourging him on
either side, until he was placed on the steps of the altar at the
legate's feet. Here, in the face of the Church, he was recon-
ciled to the sacraments thereof, abjuring all heresy, and all
heretics being cursed by him. After this, his possessions being
all forfeited and confiscated, the following penance was enjoined
on him : That, within forty days, he should depart in exile
from his country, for Jerusalem, there to remain three years
in the service of the poor ; and, in the meantime, on each
Lord's Day, he was ordered to go round the churches of the city
of Toulouse, naked and without shoes, and attended by the rods
of discipline ; to restore the property belonging to churches which
he had taken away ; to give back all usurious interest he had
received ; to repair the losses of the poor whom he had in-
jured ; and to demolish from the very foundation a castle of
his which he had profaned with the conventicles of the here-
tics. Merciful God ! what tears did holy joyousness there
pour forth, what thanksgivings and praises did the rejoicing
and devout people add to the heavenly choirs, when such a
man as this was drawn forth from the lurking-places of infi-
delity, and this most ravening wolf was transformed into a
sheep of Israel. After this, on his being dismissed, my lord
the legate sent to others with the intention of excommunicating
them, great numbers of whom either public suspicion or pri-
vate accusation had pointed out. As for ourselves, joy having
at length sprung up attended by tears, we asked for leave to
return, on the ground that pressing business of our chapter
now required our return ; which was accordingly granted to
us, but upon condition, that we should proceed to the dio-
cese of Alby, to warn Roger, the lord of the territory,
namely, that of Bediers, both to release the bishop of Alby, whom
he kept in prison and in the custody of the heretics, and to re-
form the whole of his territories, in conformity with the man-
date of my lord the legate, by expelling all heretics therefrom.
Accordingly, upon our repairing thither, together with the
above-mentioned bishop of Bath, we entered this most aban-
doned district, which, like a sink of all wickedness, received
whole sewers of heresy that flowed from all sides into it.
On this, the before-named Eoger betook himself to the most
distant and inaccessible part of his territories, both run-



A.D. 1178. LETTER OF HENRY, ABBAT OF CLAIBVAL. 489

ning away through a bad conscience and through despair of
the goodness of his cause. For he, an author of wicked-
ness, hated the light of truth, and could not endure our
approach for the purposes of a conference, having totally
devoted himself to works of darkness. However, we arrived
at a certain fortress of his, extremely well fortified, which,
appropriately and singularly, the inhabitants called by the
name of the Castle. Here lived his wife, attended with
a large retinue of knights and a very extensive household.
Nearly all the inhabitants of this castle were either heretics
or abettors of the heretics, although being held in check by
the sole might of the Lord, they presumed not even to whisper
anything against the faith which we preached. For, although
we were placed in their hands, and were fettered as it were
by being in their power, being surrounded by multitudes of
heretics on every side, still, the word of the Lord was not
checked, so as to prevent us from attacking them in repeated
censures and reproaches. And when we saw that they did
not dare to make any answer whatever, we adjudged the
said Roger to be a traitor, a heretic, and a perjurer for having
violated the safety of the bishop, and boldly, in the name
of Christ, pronounced him to have departed from the faith,
and to be condemned, as by a public excommunication, in
behalf of our lord the pope and the before-named kings, in
presence of his wife and his knights. Behold, how evident it
is that from henceforth a wide door is thrown open to Christian
princes for them to avenge the injuries of Christ, and to make
the wilderness, as it were, the garden of the Lord, and the
desert the delights of paradise. Moreover, that it may not
be alleged that little or nothing could be done against them,
Be it known to all, that it was the general opinion in the city
of Toulouse that if this visitation had been delayed for the
space of three years, there would have been hardly found one
person in it who called upon the name of Christ. In addition
to all this, the said earl of Saint Gilles has confirmed by oath,
before the people of the city, that, from this time forward, he
will neither, for gift or entreaty, show favour to the heretics."
In the same year, the king of England, the father, crossed
over from Normandy to England, and at Woodstock knighted
his son Geoffrey, earl of Brittany ; who, immediately upon
receiving the rank of a knight, passed over from England

to Normandy, and on the confines of France and Normandy,
giving his attention to military exercises, took pleasure in
making himself a match for knights of reputation in arms ; and
the more ardently did he seek for fame to attend his prowess,
from knowing that his brothers, king Henry, and Richard, earl
of Poitou, had gained great renown in arms. However, they
had but one common feeling, and that was, to excel others in
feats of arms ; being well aware that the science of war, if not
practised beforehand, cannot be gained when it becomes neces-
sary. Nor indeed can the athlete bring high spirit to the con-
test, who has never been trained to practise it. It is the man
who has seen his own blood, whose teeth have rattled beneath
another's fist, who when tripped up has strove against his ad-
versary with his entire body, and though thrown has not lost
his mettle, and who, as oft as he fell, has risen more deter-
mined, more bold, who goes forth with ardent hopes to the com-
bat. For valour when aroused adds greatly to itself; transitory
is the glory of the mind that is subjected to terror. Without
any fault of his, he is overcome by the immensity of the weight,
who comes to bear the burden and is unequal thereto, zealous
though he may be. Well is the reward paid for toil, when is
found the temple of victory.

In the same year, William, archbishop of Rheims, came into
England on a pilgrimage to the blessed Thomas the Martyr, at
Canterbury, and was met, with congratulations, by the king of
England, the father, who honored him with becoming presents.
In the same year, pope Alexander sent his legates into all parts
pf the world that were subject to him, for the purpose of in-
viting the prelates of the Church to come to Rome at the be-
ginning of Lent in the following year, to hold a solemn and
general council there. For when the violence of maladies,
with rapid steps, is hastening to the very vitals, no salutary
counsel is able to extend a hand to check it, except through
the conference of numbers. Accordingly, there came into
England two legates, namely, Albert de Suma, who was com-
missioned to summon the bishops and abbats of England and
Normandy, and Peter de Santa Agatha, whose commission
it was to summon the bishops and abbats of Scotland and Ire-
land and the adjoining islands. Accordingly, the said Peter de
Santa Agatha, for obtaining licence to pass through the territories
of the king of England, made oath, touching the holy Evan-

gelists, that in his legateship he would attempt nothing to the
detriment of the king or his kingdom, and that he would re-
turn through his dominions, which he did accordingly.

In the same year pope Alexander wrote to John king of
the Indies to the following effect :

The Letter of pope Alexander, sent to John, king of the Indies.

" Alexander the bishop, servant of the servants of God,
to his most dearly beloved son in Christ, the illustrious and
mighty king of the Indies, the most holy of priests, 24 * health,
and the Apostolic benediction. The Apostolic See, over which,
unworthy as we are, we preside, is the head and mistress of
all who believe in Christ ; the same being attested by our Lord,
who said unto Saint Peter, whose successor, unworthy though
we may be, we are, ' Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will
build my church.' 25 This rock, then, Christ has willed to be
the foundation of His church, which He declares shall be shaken
by no storms and tempests of the winds. Therefore, not
without reason did Saint Peter, upon whom He founded this
church, especially and in chief deserve to receive supremacy
among the Apostles. To him it was said by the Lord ; ' I will
give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and the gates
of hell shall not prevail against it ; and whatsoever thou shalt
bind on earth shall be bound in heaven ; and whatsoever thou
shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.' 26 We had
heard long ago, from the accounts of many, and from common
report, what unvarying diligence you have shown in pious works
since you have embraced the Christian religion, and how you
devote your attention to what is pleasing and acceptable to
God. But our beloved son, master Philip, our physician, and a
member of 'our household, who says that he has conversed in
those parts with the great and honorable men of your kingdom,
concerning your intentions and plans, like a cautious and discreet
man, circumspect and prudent, has constantly and anxiously
signified unto us, that he has heard for certain from them,
that it is your wish and purpose to be instructed in the Catholic
and Apostolic doctrines, and that it is your fervent desire that

you and the dominions entrusted unto your highness should
never appear to hold anything in your belief which may in
any degree differ from, or be at variance with the doctrines of
the Apostolic See. TJpon which, we do indeed greatly congra-
tulate you as a most dearly beloved son, and do give exceeding
thanks to Him from whom every gift proceeds, adding wish
upon wish and prayer upon prayer, that He who hath caused
you to receive the name of Christian may of His ineffable
goodness inspire your mind with a wish to obtain all know- I
ledge, which ought to be imparted to the profession of Chris-
tianity, as to all the articles of the faith. For in truth he
cannot hope to obtain salvation from the profession of Chris-
tianity, who does not in deed and in word act in accord-
ance with that profession ; as it is not sufficient for a person
to be called by the name of Catholic, who of himself thinks
otherwise than the Catholic and Apostolic doctrines teach ; in
accordance with what the Lord says in the Gospel : ' Not every
one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the king-
dom of heaven ; but he that doeth the will of my Father
which is in heaven.' 27 This also is added to our commenda-
tions of your merit, that, as the aforesaid prudent master
Philip asserts he has heard from your people, you long with
the most ardent desire to have a church in your city, and an
altar at Jerusalem where virtuous men of your kingdom may
abide, and be more fully instructed in Apostolic doctrines,
through whom you and the people of your kingdom may here-
after receive and hold the said doctrines. We, therefore, who,
though of insufficient merits, are placed in the chair of Saint
Peter, in obedience to what the Apostle says, acknowledging our-
selves as ' debtors to the wise and the unwise, the rich and the
poor,' 28 do feel every possible anxiety for the salvation of your-
self and of your people, and do wish to reclaim you from those
matters in which you deviate frem the Christian and Catholic
faith, as indeed by the duties of the office which we have un-
dertaken, we are most zealously bound to do ; for the Lord
Himself said to Saint Peter, whom he appointed to be the chief
of all the Apostles, 'When thou art converted, strengthen thy
brethren.' 29 Therefore, although it seems to be a most difficult

A.D. 1178. LETTER OF POPE ALEXANDEB. 493

and laborious matter to send any one from our side to your pre-
sence, amid so many hardships and such varied dangers of the
places on the road, and into countries far distant and unknown,
yet, considering the duties of our office, and bearing in mind
your purposes and intentions, we do send the aforesaid Philip
our physician, and one of our household, a discreet, circumspect
and cautious man unto your mightiness ; and we do trust in the
mercy of Jesus Christ, that, if it is your wish to persevere in
that purpose and intention, which we understand you, by the
inspiration of the Lord, to have formed, being forthwith, by the
mercy of God, instructed in the articles of the Christian faith
in which you and your people seem to differ from us, you may
henceforth have no cause to fear that anything will arise from
your error to impede the salvation of you or your people, or in
you cast a stigma upon the name of Christianity. We do,
therefore, request your excellency, and do advise and exhort
you in the Lord, that, for the respect you pay to Saint Peter
and to ourselves, you will receive the said Philip, as an honest,
discreet and cautious man, and as one sent from our side, with
all due kindness, and will treat him courteously and respect-
fully. And if it is your will and purpose, as indeed it fully
ought to be, to be instructed in the Apostolic doctrine on those
points which the said Philip will, on our behalf, explain to you,
you will carefully listen to him, and hear him to the end, and
will send back to us, together with him, respectable persons,
and letters sealed with your seal, whereby we may be enabled
fully to learn your purpose and intentions ; for the more exalted
and mighty you appear, and the less you seem to be puffed up
with your riches and power, so much the more willingly, both
as to granting you a church in your own city, as well as
greeting altars in the church of Saint Peter and Saint Paul,
and at Jerusalem in the church of the Sepulchre of our Lord,
and other matters which in justice you shall request, will we
take care to pay attention to your requests, and more effec-
tually to listen to the same ; inasmuch as it is our wish, in
every way that, with the help of God, we possibly can, to
promote your desires hereon, which have been so worthy of ex-
ceeding commendation, and is our ardent desire to save the
souls of you and yours unto the Lord. Given at Venice, at
the Kialto, on the fifth day before the calends of October."

In the same year, Kichard, earl of Poitou, came with a
considerable force to the city of Anse, and found there the count

of Bigorre, a prisoner in the city gaol ; whom the citizens de-
livered into his hands : on which the count of Bigorre gave to
the earl of Poitou, for his ransom, Claremont, and the castle
of Montbrun. ^.er this, he took Gengay, Martillan, Grunville,
Agenville, Tailleburg, and Pons, and levelled all these castles
with the ground. Buger, count of Angouleme, also surrendered
to him the city of Angouleme, and the castle of Montignuc,
on which he destroyed their fortifications.

In the year of grace 1179, being the twenty-fifth year
of the reign of king Henry, son of the empress Matilda, the
said Henry was in England, at Winchester, on the day of
the Nativity of our Lord. During the period of this festival,
at Oxenhale, in the lordship of Darlington, in England, the
earth raised itself up on high, in appearance like a lofty tower,
and so remained, without moving, from the ninth hour of the
day until the evening, and then fell down with such a dreadful
crash, that it alarmed all the neighbourhood, and the earth
swallowed it up, and made there a very deep pit, which re-
mains there as a testimony of the circumstance even to the
present day.

After the Nativity of our Lord, there came to England, from
Ireland, Laurence, archbishop of Dublin, Catholicus, arch-
bishop of Tuam, and five or six bishops, who were about to
proceed to the council at Rome. In the same manner, there
passed through England from the kingdom of Scotland a con-
siderable number of bishops and abbats. All these, both those
from Ireland as well as Scotland and the other islands, on
passing through England, in order to obtain leave to pass, made
oath that they would not seek any detriment to the king or to
his kingdom. From England, however, there went but four
bishops to Rome, namely, Hugh, bishop of Durham, John,
bishop of Norwich, Robert, bishop of Hereford, and Reginald,
bishop of Bath, with a considerable number of abbats : for tho
bishops of England stoutly asserted that only four bishops of
England ought to be sent to Rome to a general council of our
lord the pope.

All being accordingly assembled, at Rome, in the presence
of our lord the pope Alexander, the pope taking his seat in the
church of the Lateran, on an elevated place, together with his
cardinals, chief men, and senators, and the magistrates of the
city, commenced holding his council, which began on the second



A.D. 1179. THE DECREES OF POPE ALEXANDER. 495

day of the third week in Lent, being the third day before the
nones of March. In the same manner he held the council a
second day, on the fourth day of the following week, being the
second day before the ides of March. At this council, William,
archbishop of Rheims, was made a cardinal priest and titular
of Santa Sabina, and Henry, abbat of Clairval, was made cardi-
nal bishop of Albano. Our lord the pope held the council the
third day on the second day of the week before Palm Sunday,
being the fourteenth day before the calends of April. At this
council, he enacted that the decrees underwritten should be
universally observed.

THE DECREES OF POPE ALEXANDER.

Of the Election of the Roman Pontiff.

" Although it is manifest that statutes sufficient have been
promulgated by our predecessors for the purpose of avoiding
discord in the election of the Roman Pontiff, still however,
inasmuch as since then, by reason of the audacity of an un-
becoming ambition, the Church has oftentimes endured grievous
divisions, we also, for the purpose of avoiding the said evil,
have, with the consent of our brethren and the approba-
tion of this holy council, thought proper to add somewhat
thereto. We do therefore enact, that, if by chance, through
some enemy sowing tares among the cardinals, there shall
not be an entire agreement as to the election of a new Pontiff,
and two-thirds shall agree thereon while the remaining one-
third shall refuse to agree thereto, or shall presume to nomi-
nate or ordain any other, in such case he is to be held by the
universal Church, without any exception, to be the Roman
Pontiff who shall have been elected and acknowledged by the
two- thirds. And if any person, trusting in the votes or no-
mination of the remaining one-third, shall usurp that name,
inasmuch as he cannot in reason so do, both he himself and
those who shall acknowledge him shall be subject to the penal-
ties of excommunication, and be visited with the deprivation
of all sacred orders ; and even the communion of the holy
viaticum shall be denied unto them, except when in their last
moments ; and, unless they come to their senses, they are to re-
ceive their portion with Dathan and Abiram, whom the earth
swallowed up alive. And further, if any one shall be elected



496 A1TNALS OF EOGEE DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1179.

to the Apostolic office by fewer than two-thirds, then, unless
there shall he a more full agreement, he is in nowise to he re-
cognized as such, and he is to be subject to the penalty afore-
said, unless with all humility he shall be ready to withdraw
such claim. Still, however, let no prejudice be caused hereby
to the canonical constitutions, upon which subjects the opinions
of the larger and wiser part ought to have the preponderance,
inasmuch as whatever comes to be a matter of doubt to them,
can always be decided by the judgment of one superior. But,
in the Roman Church, something of a spiritual nature is here
being determined upon, where recourse cannot be had to a
superior. 31

How prelates are to pass sentence upon those subject to their
authority.

" A. very reprehensible custom has sprung up in some places,
where both our brethren and fellow-bishops, as well as some
archdeacons even, thinking that some will, in their causes tried
before them, resort to appeal, having first issued no admonition
whatever, proceed to pronounce against them sentence of sus-
pension and excommunication. On the other hand, also, others,
dreading the sentence and canonical discipline of their ecclesi-
astical superior, do without any difficulty interpose their right
of appeal, and usurp the same as a defence for their iniquity,
whereas it is known to have been instituted as a safeguard for
the innocent. Therefore, to the end that neither the sentence
of the prelate may be used to oppress those subject to him,
nor those subject may be enabled, at their sole option, under
the pretext of appeal, to escape correction by their prelates, by
this present decree we do enact, that neither shall prelates pass
sentence of suspension or excommunication upon those sub-
ject to them, without first issuing canonical admonition, (un-
less it shall so happen that the fault is such as of its own nature
to involve the penalty of suspension or excommunication), nor
shall those who are subject, in contravention of ecclesiastical
discipline, before the commencement of the trial, seek to
take refuge in the words of appeal. But, if any person shall
think himself absolutely necessitated to appeal, then a com-
petent time is to be named for him, within which to prose-
cute his appeal. And if he shall neglect to prosecute his
31 This passage appears to be imperfect. It seems to allude to a case
of interregnum in the Papacy.



A.D. 1179. THE DECREES OF POPE ALEXAISTDEE. 497

appeal within such limited time, then the bishop is to be at liberty
to use his own authority. And if, in any matter, any person
shall make an appeal, and on his making his appearance who was
appealed against, he who has appealed shall neglect to appear,
then, in case he shall have any property, he is to make a com-
petent return for the costs of the other, that so, at least,
being deterred, a person may not be too ready to appeal to
the detriment of another. But in especial, in places of
religious orders, we wish this to be observed, that neither
monks, nor any religious whatsoever, when they are to re-
ceive correction for any excesses, are to presume to appeal
against the regular discipline of their prelate and chapter, but
humbly and dutifully to receive what they know is enjoined
them for the more effectually securing their salvation.

Sow prelates are to be entertained by their subjects.

" Whereas the Apostle 32 ordered that 'he and his followers
should be sustained by the labours of their own hands, in
order that he might leave no room for preaching to false
apostles, and might not be burdensome to those to whom
he preached, it is known to be a great grievance and one
deserving of correction, that some of our brethren and fellow-
bishops prove so expensive in their entertainment to those
subject to them, that for reasons of this nature the subjects
are compelled to expose for sale the very ornaments of their
churches, and a short hour consumes the food earned in a long
time ; we do, therefore, enact, that archbishops visiting their
provinces shall, according to the different character of the pro-
vinces and the means of the churches, under no circumstance
exceed a retinue of forty or fifty horses, bishops twenty or thirty,
rardinals twenty or five-and-twenty, while archdeacons are to
be content with five or seven, and deans with two horses. And
further, they are not to go about with hounds and hawks, or to
require sumptuous entertainments, but to receive with thank-
fulness that which shall properly and consistently with the
entertainer's means, be provided for them. We do also forbid
that bishops shall presume to oppress their subjects with tal-
lages or exactions, and so' conduct themselves as to appear to
seek not what is their own, but what belongs to Jesus Christ.
For, as the Apostle says, ' The children ought not to lay up for

32 Saint Paul.
VOL. I. K K



498 ANNALS OF ROGEK BE HOVEDEN. A. D. 1179.

the parents, but the parents for the children,' 33 it seems to be
greatly at variance with the affection of a father, if those who
are the governors make them burdensome to their subjects,
whom in all their necessities they ought to .cherish, like good
shepherds. Also, archdeacons and deans are not to. presume to
demand any exactions or tallages 34 from priests or clerks.
And further, what we have said above relative to the num-
ber of horses that are to be allowed, is to be observed in
those places the revenues and ecclesiastical dues of which are
ample. But in poor places, it is our wish that such limits
should be observed, that the lesser ones shall not have to com-
plain that a hardship is inflicted on them by the arrival of the
greater, so that those who were in the habit of using a
smaller number of horses may not suppose that they are in-
dulged with leave to use more. Indeed, considering the many
necessitous cases that occasionally arise, we could endure that,
if a manifest and reasonable cause should be found to exist,
they should be enabled to demand some slight assistance to-
gether with our brotherly love.

That new imposts are not to be made in churches.

11 Inasmuch as in the body of the Church, all ought to be
treated with loving-kindness, and that which has been received
gratuitously ought gratuitously to be bestowed, it is a most
shocking thing that in some churches venality is said to pre-
vail to such a degree, that, for installing bishops or abbats,
or any other ecclesiastical persons, or introducing priests
into the church, as also for the burial and obsequies of
the dead, and the benedictions of the newly -married, or
other ecclesiastical sacraments, money is demanded : and that
he who stands in need of these things, cannot obtain the same
unless he takes care to fill the hand of the bestower thereof.
Many imagine that it is lawful for them to act thus, on this
ground, because they think that the custom as to the dead has
been established by lengthened usage, not sufficiently con-
sidering, inasmuch as they are blinded by avarice, that the
longer offences have kept the mind fettered, so much the more
grievous they are. In order, therefore, that this may not be
done in future, we strictly forbid that money shall be demanded
for installing ecclesiastical persons, instituting priests, burying
2 Cor. xii. 14. Taxes.



A.D. 1179. THE DECBEES OF POPE ALEXANDER. 499

the dead, blessing the newly-married, or any other of the
sacraments. And if any person shall presume in contraven-
tion hereof to sell the same, then let him know that he will
have his portion with Gehazi, whose deeds he has imitated in
the exacting of a disgraceful gift. We do, moreover, forbid
any new imposts to be exacted from churches, either by bishops
or abbats, or any other prelate, or the old ones to be increased,
or that such persons shall presume to appropriate any part of
the revenues to their own use ; but the same liberty which
the greater ones desire to be preserved for themselves, let them
also, with good will, preserve for the lesser ones. And if any
person shall do otherwise than this, what he so does is to be
deemed null and void.

Christians are forbidden to enter the service of the Saracens.

" To such a degree has shocking cupidity taken possession of
the minds of some, that, whereas they glory in the name of
Christians, they carry arms to the Saracens, and by supplying
them with arms and necessaries for the purpose of warring
against the Christians, show themselves their equals or even
their superiors in wickedness. There are some also, who, by
reason of their cupidity, exercise the art and craft of pilots, in
the galleys and piratical vessels of the Saracens. Such persons
therefore we do order to be cut off from the communion of the
Church, and for their iniquity to be subjected to excommunica-
tion, and to be mulcted with confiscation of their property by
the Catholic princes and rulers of states, and if they are taken,
to become the slaves of those so taking them. We do also order
that throughout the churches of the cities on the coast, a re-
^teated and solemn sentence of excommunication shall be pro-
nounced against them. Those also are to be subject to the pe-
nalty of excommunication, who presume either to take captive
or to despoil of their property llomans, or indeed any other
Christians, when voyaging for purposes of merchandize or any
other becoming reasons. Those also, who, with damnable
avarice, dare to despoil Christians who have suffered shipwreck
of their property, when according to the rules of religion they
are bound to aid them, are to know that they are subjected to
excommunication, unless they restore what they have so taken
away.

That tournaments shall not le held.

"Continuing in the footsteps of popes Innocent and Eugenius,
of blessed memory, our predecessors, we do forbid those detesta-
ble revels and shows, which are commonly called tournaments,
at which, by proclamation, knights are wont to meet together,
and rashly engage with each other, to show off their prowess
and valour, and from which, deaths of men and perils to souls
do so often ensue. And, if any one of such persons shall meet
with his death on such an occasion, although absolution is not
denied him, still he is to be deprived of Christian burial.

On keeping the truces.

" We do order truces to be inviolably observed by all persons
from the fourth day of the week after sunset, until the seventh
day of the week after sunrise, both from the Advent of our
Lord until the octave of Epiphany, and from Septuagesima
until the octave of Easter. And if any person shall attempt
to break such truce, if after the third warning he shall not
make reparation, then his bishop is to pronounce sentence of
excommunication, and announce the same in writing to the
neighbouring bishops. And no bishop is to receive him who
is thus excommunicated to communion ; but, on the contrary,
each is to confirm the sentence, the copy of which he has re-
ceived. And if any one shall presume to violate this com-
mand, then let him be subject to the peril of losing his orders.
And, inasmuch as a threefold rope is broken with difficulty, we
do order that bishops, having respect only to God and the
salvation of the people, and all cupidity apart, shall use their
advice and assistance for the purpose of the strict main-
tenance of peace, and not neglect the same through love or
hatred for any person whatsoever. And if any one shall be
found to be lukewarm in this work of God, he is to submit to
the loss of his own dignity.

On annulling ordinations made by Anti-popes.
" Re-enacting that which was done by our predecessor, pope
Innocent, of blessed memory, we do pronounce the ordinations
made by Octavianus and Guido, the heresiarchs, as also by
John of Struma, their follower, to be null and void, as also
ordinations made by the persons so ordained by them ; and
we do further add, that those who have received ecclesiastical
dignities or benefices, by means of the aforesaid schismatics,



A.D. 1179. THE DECBEES OF POPE ALEXANDER. 501

shall resign what they have so acquired. All alienations also
or seizures of things ecclesiastical, which have been made by
the said schismatics, or by laymen, are to be wanting in validity,
and to return to the church without any incumbrance what-
ever thereon. And if any one shall presume to contravene
this command, he is to know that he is subjected to excommu-
nication. As for those who, of their own accord, have taken
oath to maintain the schism, we do decree that they shall re-
main suspended from their holy orders and dignities.

What sort of persons they ought to be, who are to be elected to
govern the Church.

"As in all holy orders and ecclesiastical offices, both maturity
of age, gravity of manners, and skill in literature, are to be
sought for, s6 ought the same much more rigidly to be exacted
in the case of a bishop, who, being placed in charge of others,
ought in himself to show how others are to preserve the same
qualities in the house of the Lord ; to the end that what has
been done by some persons, through the necessities of the
times, may not be adopted as an example by posterity. We do,
therefore, by the present decree enact that no one shall be elected
to be a bishop, who has not passed the thirtieth year of his age,
and is not born in lawful wedlock, and who cannot be shown to
be of praiseworthy life and learning. And when he, who has
been so elected, shall have received the confirmation of his
election, and the administration of ecclesiastical effects, the
time having expired that is pointed out by the canons for the
consecration of bishops, he is to have free option to dis-
pose of the benefices which belong to him, for the purpose of
distribution. Also, the lower offices, such, for instance, as
fteaneries or archdeaconries, and others which have the care
of souls annexed, no person whatever is to receive, nor yet the
government of parochial churches, unless he shall have attained
the twenty-fifth year of his age, and is of praiseworthy know-
ledge and manners. 35 And [in case of misbehaviour] they are

35 Here follow these words. " Cum autem assumptus fuerit, si Archidia-
conus in Diaconum ; Decanus et reliqui admoniti non fuerint, praefixo a
canonibus tempore in presbyteros ordinati," They are evidently frag-
mentary and incomplete, to such an extent that it seems impossible to
guess the general meaning of the passage. It is clear that at least one
important sentence is omitted, if not more.



502 ANNALS OF KOGER DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 11T9.

to be removed from those offices, and the same are to be bestowed
on another, who is both willing and able becomingly to fill the
same, and they are not to profit by the pretext of appealing,
if they should chance to desire to defend themselves in the
transgression of these ordinances, by means of appeal. This,
indeed, we order to be observed, not only as to those in future
to be promoted, but those also who have been already promoted,
if the canons do not impede such a course. If the clergy
shall elect any one in contravention of the form above stated
they are to understand that they are deprived of the power of
electing on that occasion, and from their ecclesiastical benefices
suspended for a period of three years. For it is a becoming
thing, that those whom the fear of God does not withhold from
evil, the severity of ecclesiastical discipline should at least re-
strain. And as for the bishop, if he shall act contrary to these
mandates, or shall consent to such being done, he is to lose
his power in the disposal of the offices above-named, and ordi-
nation is to be made by the chapter, or by the metropolitan,
if the chapter shall not agree thereon. 36

Of Heretics.

" As Saint Leo says, ' Although the discipline of the Church,
being contented with the judgment of the priesthood, avoids
a blood-thirsty vengeance,' still it is aided by the enact-
ments of Catholic princes, that so men may often find a salutary
remedy, while they dread that corporal punishment may
befall them. Wherefore, inasmuch as, in Gascony, the Al-
bigeois, and other places inhabited by the heretics whom
some style ' Catarri,' others ' Publicani,' and others ' Paterini,'
and others call by other names, their damnable perverseness has
waxed so strong that they practise their wickedness no longer
in secret as elsewhere, but publicly expose their errors, and
draw the simple and weak to be their accomplices, we do de-
cree them and their protectors and harborers to be excommu-
nicated, and under pain of excommunication we do forbid any
one to dare to receive or to encourage them in his house or on
his lands, or to have any transactions with them. And if they
shall depart this life in their sin, and not under the protection

36 The meaning of the latter part of this enactment is involved in great
obscurity ; probably in consequence of the evident omission in the middle
of it.



A. U. 1179. THE DECREES OF POPE ALEXANDER. 503

of any privileges granted by our indulgence, then on no pretence
whatever is any contribution to be made for their interment,
nor are they to receive burial among Christians. And as regards
the Brabanters, Arragonese, Navarrese, Biscayans, and Cote-
rells, 37 who exercise such enormous cruelties against Christians,
as not to pay any respect to either churches or monasteries, or
to spare widows or orphans, young or old, or any age or sex, but
who, after the manner of pagans, lay waste and ravage in every
direction, we do similarly enact. "We do also enact that those who
shall hire, or retain, or encourage them, shall, throughout the
communities where such excesses are committed, on the Lord's
day and other solemn days be publicly proclaimed as excom-
municated in all the churches there, and shall be held to be
condemned with the same sentence and punishment in all
respects as the aforesaid heretics, and shall not be received into
communion with the Church, unless they first abjure the said
abominable societies and heresies respectively. Those also are
to understand who are connected with them by any tie, that
they are relieved from all duties of fealty, or homage, or any
obedience to them whatsoever, so long as they shall persist in
such great iniquity ; and we do further command them and
all the faithful, for the remission of their sins, manfully to
oppose such dreadful ravages, and in arms to defend the Chris-
tian people against them. Their property also is to be confis-
cated, and the superior lords are to be at liberty to subject men of
this description to slavery. As for those, however, who shall so
separate from them in true repentance, let them not doubt that
they will obtain the indulgence granted to sinners, and the bless-
ings of an eternal reward. And further, trusting in the mercy
f God, and confiding in the authority of Saint Peter and Saint
Paul the Apostles, we do remit two years of enjoined penance
to those faithful Christians who shall take up arms, and, at the
advice of their own or other prelates, fight against them ; and
if they shall be detained a considerable time in so doing, then
we do leave it to the discretion of the bishops to whose care
37 These were lawless hireling soldiers, who were guilty of great out-
rages ; they were said to have received their name of " Coterelli' ' from their
use of a large knife called " coterel," the same being given them by the
people of Toulouse ; while others derive it from " cotarius," a cottager,

tit being their habit to levy heavy contributions on people of that class.
They were also called " Ruptarii," " Routiers," or " Ryters," and were
much employed by the early kings of England.
' .



504 ANNALS OF EOGEB DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1179.

these matters shall be entrusted, that so, at their option, in
proportion to the amount of labor expended, a still greater
indulgence may be granted them. But as for those who shall
neglect to pay obedience to the admonition of the bishops
hereon, we do order them to be debarred from receiving the
body and blood of our Lord: while those in the meantime, who,
in their zeal for the faith, shall undertake the laborious task of
uprooting them, like those who repair to the sepulchre of our
Lord, we do take under the protection of the Church, and do
decree that they shall remain secure from all molestation, both
in property and person. And if any person shall in the mean-
time presume to molest them, then sentence of excommuni-
cation is to be hurled against him by the bishop of the place, and
let such sentence be observed by all, until such time as both
what has been taken away is restored, and full satisfaction is
made for losses caused by them. And further, bishops or
priests who shall chance not to show a proper resistance to
such persons, are to be visited with suspension from their offices
until such time as they shall have obtained mercy from the
Apostolic See.

That leprous persons are to have a private church and burial-
ground of their own.

" Whereas it is said by the Apostle Saint Paul that more
abundant honor is bestowed upon those members of the body
which are less honorable: 38 so on the other hand, there are some
who seek their own and not what is of Jesus Christ, and who
will not allow leprous persons who cannot dwell with those
in health, or to meet in churches with others, either to have
churches and burial-grounds of their own, or to have the ser-
vices of their own minister. Inasmuch as this is clearly
at variance with Christian piety, we do, in our Apostolic bounty,
enact that wherever enough shall have been assembled in one
community to be enabled to found a church for themselves
with a burial-ground, and to enjoy the services of their own
priest, they shall, withou-t any opposition, be allowed to have
the same. They are, however, to take due care that as to paro-
chial rights they are not in any way detrimental to the interests
of the old churches ; for we are unwilling that that which is
conceded through feelings of piety, should redound to the injury
of others. We do also enact that they shall not be compelled
to pay tithes of vegetable produce and the young of animals.
39 1 Cor. xii. 23.



A. D. 1179. THE DECREES OF POPE ALEXANDER. 505

That Christians shall not dwell with Jews or Saracens.
" Neither Jews nor Saracens are to be allowed to have
Christian slaves in their houses, either under pretext of rear-
ing children, or for any services or cause whatsoever. And
further, those shall be excommunicated who shall presume to
dwell with them. We do also enact that the testimony of
Christians shall be received against the Jews in all causes
against Christians where they make use of their own witnesses ;
and we do decree that those persons shall be excommunicated
who shall attempt in this respect to prefer Jews to Christians,
as it is right and proper that they should be beneath the
Christians, and be by them, supported on grounds of humanity
alone. Moreover, if any by the inspiration of God shall be
converted to the Christian faith, they are on no account to
suffer loss of their possessions, 39 as, after being converted to the
faith they ought to be in a better condition than they were in
before they conformed to the faith. And if anything shall be
done in contravention hereof, we do, under penalty of excom-
munication, enjoin the princes or authorities of those places,
to cause full restitution to be made to them of that portion
of their hereditary property and possessions.

That no person shall for money receive the monastic or any
religious habit.

"Monks are not to be received in a monastery for money, nor
are they to be allowed to hold property of their own. They are
not to be distributed alone in vills and towns, or in any paro-
chial churches : but are to remain in the general convent, or in
apany with some other of the brethren, so as not alone to
ait the conflict of spiritual with secular men ; for it is Solo-
mon who says : ' Woe to him that is alone when he falleth ; for
he hath not another to help him up.' 40 And if any person on
demand shall give anything for his admission, then he is not
to be admitted to holy orders, and he who has admitted him is
to be punished by loss of his office. And if any one shall have
private property, unless the same shall have been permitted by
the abbat for the carrying out of some purpose that has been
enjoined, he is to be removed from the communion of the altar ;
and if any one shall be found when at the point of death to

506 ANNALS OF ROGEE DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1179.

possess property, no offering is to be made for him, and he is
not to have burial among the brethren. The same we do com-
mand to be observed in the various religious orders ; and the
abbat who shall not diligently observe the same, is to know that
he thereby incurs the loss of his office. Also, no priorships or
abbacies are to be given to any one for the receipt of money ; and
in such cases both the giver and the receiver are to be removed
from all ecclesiastical duties. Also, where priors have been ap-
pointed over conventual churches, they are not, unless for a
manifest and reasonable cause, to be removed ; unless, for in-
stance, they have been guilty of dilapidation, or lived inconti-
nently, or been guilty of any thing of a like nature, by reason
of which they may appear to deserve to be removed : as also,
in cases where by the consent of the brethren he shall have
been transferred in consequence of the necessity of his filling
some higher office.

That tw person shall hold several churches.

"Inasmuch as certain persons, placing no limits to their
avarice, in contravention of the enactments of the sacred
canons, both endeavour to obtain divers ecclesiastical dignities
and several parish churches, so that, while they are hardly
able to fulfil the duties of one office, they obtain the salary that
is the due of many, we do strictly forbid that this shall in future
be done. Therefore, when an ecclesiastical office ought to be
filled up, let a person be found to fill it who is able to reside
on the spot, and to perform its duties himself. And if any
persons shall act in contravention hereof, both he who has
received the office is to lose the money that, contrary to the
sacred canons, he has received, and he who has given it is to be
deprived of the power of giving it in future. And, inasmuch
as the ambition of some has now reached to such a pitch that
they are said to hold not two or three, but six offices or even
more, while at the same time they are not able to perform the
prescribed duties for even two, we do order this to be remedied
by our brethren and fellow-bishops ; and that, from these plu-
ralities so hateful to the canons, which afford a ground for the
breaking up of societies, and for the wandering of their mem-
bers to and fro, and produce certain peril to souls, the indi-
gence of those may be relieved, who are able to give their
services to churches. Moreover, because the audacity of some



A.l). 1179. THE DECREES OF POPE ALEXANDER. 507

laymen has increased to such a pitch that, neglecting the autho-
rity of the bishops, they institute clerks in churches and remove
them when they please, and distribute property and other pos-
sessions of Ihe Church mostly at their own option, and dare to
harass the churches themselves, as well as the people, with
tallages and exactions, we do enact that, from henceforth, if
they shall be guilty of the same, they shall be visited with
excommunication. The priest also, or clerk, who shall receive
a church from laymen, without the authority of his own bishop,
shall be deprived from the communion ; and if he persists, then
he shall be deposed from his ecclesiastical office and orders. And,
further, inasmuch as some laymen compel ecclesiastical persons,
and even bishops themselves, to abide by their judgments, those
who shall do so in future we do order to be cut off from all
intercourse with the faithful. "We do also forbid, on peril
of their souls, laymen withholding tithes, under any circum-
stances, making over the same to other laymen. And if any
person receives the same, and does not restore them to the
Church, he is to be deprived of Christian burial.

That manifest usurers shall not be admitted to the communion
at the altar.

" Inasmuch as in almost every place the crime of usury has
become prevalent, so much so, that many, neglecting their
usual business, adopt usury as their lawful occupation, and
do not consider how the same is condemned by the pages
of both Testaments, we do therefore enact, that manifest
usurers shall not be received to communion at the altar, nor
shall any of them receive Christian burial, or even an oblation,
if lu- shall die in this sin. And he who shall have received
sufti offering, or have given Christian burial to such usurer, is
both to be compelled to return what he has received, and is to
remain suspended from the duties of his office until such time
as, in the judgment of the bishop, he shall have given satis-
faction.

Of the mils of clerks.

" "Whereas, in the duties of brotherly love, we seem in espe-
cial bound to those from whom we know that we have received
benefits, on the other hand, certain of the clergy, after having
received considerable property from their churches, presume to






508 ANNALS OF BOGKER DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1179.

leave property thus acquired through churches to other persons.
Therefore, although it is well known that by the ancient canons
this is prohibited, we do nevertheless, once more prohibit it.
And it being our wish therefore, to provide an indemnity for the
Church, whether these persons shall have died intestate, or whe-
ther they shall have attempted to bestow the same property
on others, we do order that the same shall remain in possession
of the churches. Moreover, inasmuch as in some places per-
sons are appointed for a sum of money, and are called deans,
and thus for a fixed sum of money exercise episcopal juris-
diction, we do, by the present decree, enact that whoever in
future shall presume thus to act shall be deprived of his office,
and the bishop shall lose the right of conferring the same.

Of the regulation of ecclesiastical communities.

"Whereas, in all churches that which seems fit to the
greater part and the elder of the brethren, ought, without hesi-
tation, to be observed, it seems most grievous and most worthy
of censure that in some churches a few, not so much on reason-
able grounds as by reason of their own wilfulness, throw ob-
stacles in the way of the commands of the majority, and will
not allow the ecclesiastical ordinances to be carried out : there-
fore, by the present decree we do enact, that, unless any reason-
able ground shall be shown by the fewer and younger, all power
of appeal removed, that which is ordained, on due consideration
by the greater and elder part, shall always prevail and be carried
into effect. Nor is it to be any impediment to this our ordinance,
if any person says that he is bound by oath to observe the
customs of his church. For they are not to be called oaths,
but perjuries rather, which are in opposition to the interests
of the Church and the institutions of the holy fathers. And
if any person has presumed to swear to maintain customs of
this nature, which are neither supported by reason, nor agree
with the holy institutions, he is to be debarred from receiving
the body of our Lord until such time as he shall have per-
formed due penance for the same.

Of the presentation of clerks.

"Whereas, in certain places, the founders of churches, or
their heirs, abuse their power, in which the Church has
hitherto borne with them; and whereas in the Church of



A.D. 1179. THE DECREES OF POPE ALEXANDER. 509

God there ought to be but one who is the chief, while many,
without regard to those who are subject, strive to elect ; and
whereas one church ought to have but one ruler, while they
present, in defence of their own rights, a number of rulers ; we
do by the present decree enact, that if several founders divide
and give conflicting votes, that person shall be appointed over
the church who is recommended by his manners and merits,
and is chosen and approved of by the suffrages of the most
persons. But, if this cannot be done without offence, the
bishop is to regulate the church in- such way as he shall think
is best suited to the honor of God, and he is to do the same,
even though some question shall have arisen as to the right of
patronage, and even if, within three months, it shall be ascer-
tained to whom it belongs.

On preserving peace.

" We do also enjoin that priests, clerks, monks, lay monks,
pilgrims, merchants, and serfs, when going to and fro, and
engaged in agriculture, as well as the animals with which
they plough, and the other things which they take into the
fields, shall enjoy befitting security ; and no person in office
whatever is anywhere to presume to make new exactions with-
out the authority and consent of the kings and rulers, or to
enact statutes on the moment, or in any way to impugn the
old ones. And if any one shall act contrary to this, and, on
being warned, shall not cease so doing, then, till such time as he
shall have made due satisfaction, he is to be cut off from all
Christian intercourse.

That ecclesiastical benefices shall not be given to any one, before
they are vacant.

" No ecclesiastical benefices, or offices, or churches, shall be
I given to any person, or be promised, before they are vacant, that
so no one may seem to long for the death of his neighbour,
to whose place and benefice he thinks he shall succeed. For
< whereas this same thing is found prohibited even in the laws
of the heathens, it is most disgraceful, and most deserving of the
censures of the Divine judgment, if expectation of future suc-
cession should hold a place in the Church of God, a thing
which even the heathens themselves have taken care to con-
demn. But when it happens that churches, to which presen-






510 ANNALS OF EOGEE DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1179.

tation is to be made, or any offices in any church, are vacant,
or if at piesent any are vacant, they are not to remain long
unfilled, but within six months let persons be presented to
them, who are able properly to perform the duties thereof.
But if the bishop, when it is his duty to do so, delays to
collate such person, he is to be appointed by the chapter. And
if the election belongs to the chapter, and it shall not have
so done by the time appointed, the bishop, using the advice
of religious men, is to do the same according to the will of God :
or if all shall chance to neglect it, then the metropolitan of
the bishop, according to the will of God, and without any con-
tradiction on their part, is to dispose thereof.

That no one shall be ordained without a certain title.
" If a bishop shall ordain any person as deacon or priest with-
out a certain title by which he may earn the necessaries of
life, then he is to provide him with necessaries, until such time
as he shall assign him, in some church, a suitable salary for
clerical duties, unless the person ordained shall happen to
be able to subsist on property of his own, or inherited from
his father.

That clerks in holy orders shall not keep concubines.
" Clerks in holy orders, who, bearing the character of incon-
tinence, keep young women in their houses, are either to put
them away and live chastely, or else to be deprived of their
benefices and ecclesiastical duties. Whoever shall be found to
labour under that kind of incontinence which is against nature,
and on account of which the wrath of God came upon the sons
of distrust, and He consumed five cities with fire, if they are
clerks they shall be expelled from the clergy, or be set apart
in a monastery to do penance there ; if they are laymen, they
shall be excommunicated and utterly removed from the com-
munity of the faithful. Moreover, if any clerk, without
necessary and manifest cause, shall presume to frequent mo-
nasteries of nuns, he is to be warned thence by the bishop, and
if he shall not cease so to do, he is to be deprived of his
ecclesiastical benefice.

That laymen shall not impose burdens on churches.

" It is known to be no less a sin in those who do so, than a
detriment to those who submit to it, that rulers and the chief



A. D. 1179. THE DECREES OF POPE ALEXAtfDEK. . 511

men in cities throughout the different parts of the world, as
well as others who seem to hold some power, frequently impose
upon churches such numerous burdens, and oppress them with
such heavy and repeated exactions, that the priesthood seems
under them to be in a worse condition than it was under
Pharaoh, who had no knowledge of the law of the Lord. For
whereas he, when all others were reduced to slavery, left
their priests and possessions in their former liberty, and gave
them sustenance at the public expense, these others impose
almost all their burdens on the churches, and afflict them
with so many anxieties, that the lamentation of Jeremiah
seems to apply thereto, 'She that was princess among the
provinces, now is she become tributary ! ' 43 For, whether it is
the expense of making fortifications, or whether of an expe-
dition, or whether they think proper to do anything else, they
generally attempt to provide for them all out of the property
of the churches, of the clergy, and of the poor, the advantages
of Christ being thereby curtailed. On these grounds we must
feel grieved for the clrarches, and none the less for those who
seem to have entirely lost all fear of God and respect for the
ecclesiastical order. Wherefore, under the most severe penalty
of excommunication, we do strictly forbid any one in future to
presume to make such an attempt, unless a bishop or clerk shall
evidently see such a case of necessity and utility as to be of
opinion that, without compulsion, subsidies may be collected
throughout the churches to relieve the common necessities, the
means of the laity not sufficing thereto. And if rulers, or
other persons, shall in future be guilty of this, and, on being
warned, shall chance to be unwilling to desist, they are to know
that both themselves, as well as their abettors, are subjected
tcL excommunication, and are not to be restored to intercourse
with the faithful until such time as they shall have made
befitting satisfaction.

That prelates are to provide necessaries for the masters of schools.

"Inasmuch as the Church of God, both in those things
which tend to the support of the body and in those which
pertain to the profit of the soul, is bound, like an affectionate
mother, to provide for the needy, in order that the opportunity

Lam. i. 1.



512 AUNALS OF EOGEB DE HOYEDEN. A.D. 1179.

of reading and of improving may not be withheld from the
poor who cannot he assisted by the means of their relations,
in each cathedral church a certain competent provision is to be
made for a master, who is to teach gratuitously the clerks of
the said church and the poor scholars, in order that thereby
the necessities of the teacher may be relieved, and a way may
be opened to learning for those who are studying ; in other
churches or monasteries, also, this is to be rectified, if in past
times any curtailment shall chance to have been made therein.
For a licence to teach no one is to demand any fee whatever,
nor is he, under pretext of any custom, to make any demand
of those who teach ; nor yet, when a licence has been given,
is he to forbid any one to teach who is fitted for so doing. The
person who shall presume to contravene this enactment, is to
be deprived of all ecclesiastical benefices. For it seems only
proper and becoming, that, in the Church of God, he should
not gain the fruit of his labours who, in the cupidity of his
mind, endeavours, while he is selling a licence to teach, to ob-
struct the profit of the Church.

That clerks shall not presume to undertake secular business.

" Clerks in archdeacon's orders, and above, as well as those of
a lower grade, if they are supported by ecclesiastical salaries,
are not to presume to act as advocates before secular judges
in forensic business, unless they are prosecuting their own
cause or that of the Church, or chance to be acting on- behalf
of distressed persons, who cannot manage their own causes.
And neither is any clerk to presume to act the part of procurator
of a town, or to exercise any secular jurisdiction under any
princes or men of secular power, so as to act as their jus-
ticiaries. And if any person shall presume to contravene this
enactment, because he acts in a worldly manner, contrary to
the doctrine of the Apostle, when he says that no one who
fights for God busies himself with the affairs of this world,
he is to be removed from the ecclesiastial ofiice, because,
neglecting his clerical duties, he has plunged into the waves
of the world in order to please the powerful. We do also
decree that strict punishment is to ensue, if any person in
religious orders shall presume to attempt to do any of the
things aforesaid.



A.D. 1179. DECREES OF POPE ALEXANDER. 513

Of Churches that have been laid under an interdict, and t/te
burial of those under interdict.

11 Inasmuch as it is our bounden duty both to plant the sacred
religion, and when planted in every way to cherish it, we can
never attempt the same to better purpose, than if we consider
that it has been entrusted to us by the authority of God, to foster
that which is right, and to correct that which impedes the pro-
gress of the truth. Wherefore, in consequence of the strong
complaints of our brethren and our fellow-bishops, we have
understood that the brethren of the Temple and of the Hos-
pital, as well as others of the religious profession, exceeding
the privileges with which they have been indulged by the
Apostolic See, presume to do many things which both tend to
scandal among the people of God, and produce grievous evil
to souls. For they have purposed to receive churches from the
hands of laymen; they admit persons excommunicated and
under interdict to the Sacraments of the Church, and allow
burial in their churches, contrary to good conscience, and
institute and remove priests at their pleasure. And whereas
the indulgence has been granted to their brethren when
going to seek alms, that upon their arrival such churches 43
may be opened once in a year, and Divine service performed
therein, as we have heard, several of them have frequently
come from one or more of their houses to a place under
interdict, and have abused the indulgence of their privileges
by performing service therein, and then presuming to bury
the dead in the churches aforesaid. And further, by means
of the fraternities which in many places they establish, they
sap the strength of the episcopal authority, while, in contra-
vention of the sentences of the bishops, under the pretext of
some of their own privileges, they strive to screen all those
who are ready to join their fraternity. And whereas we
have thought proper to make these declarations not so much
with reference to the conscience or design of the higher autho-
rities among them, as to fLe fact that some of those of a lower
grade have exceeded what in discretion they ought to observe,
for the purpose of removing those matters in which they
are guilty of excess, and which tend to cause doubts ; we do
therefore forbid both them and all other religious whatsoever,
43 Laid under interdict.

VOL. I. L L



514 ANNALS OF EOGER DK DOVEDEff. A.D. 1179.

without the consent of their bishops, to receive churches and tithes
from the hands of laymen, not taking regard of what up to the
present time they have, contrary to the tenor hereof, received.
Persons excommunicated and by name laid under interdict, we
do pronounce to be avoided both by them and by all other per-
sons whatsoever, in conformity with the sentences pronounced
by the bishops. In those of their churches which do not belong
to them fully of right, they are to present priests to the bishops
for institution therein, who shall be answerable to them for their
care of the people, and give to themselves a proper account as
to the temporal things thereof. Also, they are not to presume to
remove those once instituted without consulting the bishops
thereon. And if Templars or Hospitallers come to a church laid
under interdict, they are to be admitted only once in a year to
perform service therein, and not even then are they to bury there
the bodies of those under interdict. Also, as to these fraternities
we do enact, that if they shall not entirely join the brethren
aforesaid, but shall think proper to reside upon their own pro-
perties, still they are in nowise on that account to be exempt
from the sentence of the bishops, who are to exercise their
authority over them just like the other persons of their dioceses,,
where they require correction for their excesses. What has
been said above as to the aforesaid brethren we do also com-
mand to be observed as to other persons in religious orders who
in their presumption intrude upon the path, and presume to
enter on a course contrary to their own canonical professions
and the tenor of our own privileges. If, however, they shall
presume to contravene this enactment, both the churches in
which they shall presume so to do shall be laid under interdict,
and what they have done shall be deemed null and void."

These decrees being promulgated and received by the whole
of the clergy and people standing around, the bishops and
other ecclesiastics who had met together, with the gift of the
benediction, received leave to return home.

In the same year, the king of England, the son, returned
from Normandy to England at mid-Lent, and, during the follow-
ing Easter, he and the king, his father, were at Winchester.
After Easter, Richard de Lucy, justiciary of England, resigned
the office of justiciary, and became a canon-regular in his abbey
of Lewes," which he himself had founded on his property and

had enriched with many possessions ; shortly after which he
died. After his decease, the king, the father, held a great coun-
cil at Windsor, and by the common consent of the archbishops,
bishops, earls, and barons, in presence of the king, his son,
divided England into four parts, and over each of them ap-
pointed wise men to administer justice throughout the land, in

The last six to whom the above counties were assigned were ap-
pointed justices in the king's court, to hear the public claims.

In the same year, Geoffrey, earl of Brittany, by com-
mand of the king, his father, passed over from England to
Brittany, and, assembling an army, laid waste the lands of
Guidomer de Leuns, and forced him to surrender. In the
same year, Henry, king of England, the son, returned
from England to Normandy. In the same year, Louis, king
of the Franks sent to Constantinople his daughter Agnes,
whom his wife Ala, queen of the Franks, and sister of
William, archbishop of Rheims, and of the counts Henry,
Theobald, and Stephen, had borne to him, to be married to
Alexis, the son of Manuel, emperor of Constantinople. In
the same year, Philip, the son of Louis, king of the Franks,
and of the said queen, Ala, fell ill, and was in danger of his
life ; at which his father was extremely grieved, and was ad-
monished in his sleep by a Divine revelation to vow that he
would go on a pilgrimage to the tomb of Saint Thomas the
Martyr, at Canterbury, to prevail upon him to restore his son
to health.

In consequence of this, Louis, king of the Franks, sent
ambassadors to Henry, king of England, the father, and asked
for leave and a safe conduct upon coming into England, and
also liberty to return without any impediment ; which was
granted accordingly. Therefore, putting his trust in the Lord,
contrary to the advice of many, he set out for England.
Taking with him Philip, earl of Flanders, and Baldwin, earl
of Guisnes, Henry, duke of Louvaine, count William de Man-
deville, the advocate of Bethune, and other barons of the king-
dom of France, he came to Witsand, and thence passed over to
England, arriving at Dover on the eleventh day before the
calends of September, being the fourth day of the week. The

king of England, the father, came to meet him on the sea-shore,
and received him with great honor and congratulations, as his
most dearly-beloved liege lord and friend, and, with due re-
spect, supplied all necessaries for him and his people.

On the following day, that is to say, on the vigil of Saint
Bartholomew the Apostle, he escorted him to the tomb of
Saint Thomas the Martyr, at Canterbury. Upon arriving there,
Louis, king of the Franks, offered upon the tomb of Saint
Thomas the Martyr a cup of gold, very large and of great
value, and gave, for the use of the monks there in the service
of God, a hundred tuns of wine, to be received yearly for ever
at Poissy, in France, entirely at the expense of the king of
France. In addition to this, he granted them that whatever
in future should be bought in the kingdom of France for their
own use, should be free from toll and all other customs and
excise. All this he caused to be confirmed by his charter, which
they received at the hands of Hugh de Pudsey, chancellor of
the king of France, and son of Hugh, bishop of Durham.
On the third day after this, the king of France and his people
who were with him returned to Dover, under the escort of the
king of the English ; and on the following day, namely, the
seventh day before the calends of September, being the Lord's
Day, the king of France crossed over from England to Flan-
ders, and landed at Witsand.

In the meantime, his son Philip, through the merits and
prayers of the blessed Thomas the Martyr, was restored to
his former health : on hearing which, the king of France,
elated, amid great public rejoicings, ordered by proclama-
tion that all the chief men of his kingdom, both ecclesias-
tical and secular, should assemble at Eheims, at the beginning
8f the calends of November, in order to celebrate there the
coronation of his son Philip. When they were assembled
there, William, archbishop of Rheims, crowned the before-
named Philip, the son of his sister Ala, who was now in the
fifteenth year of his age, and anointed him king at Rheims,
in the church there of the Pontifical See, on the day of the
feast of All Saints, being assisted in the performance of that
office by William, archbishop of Tours, and the archbishops
of Bourges and Sens, and nearly all the bishops of the kingdom.

preceded him, bearing the golden crown with which the said
Philip was to be crowned, in right of the dukedom of Nor-
mandy. Philip, earl of Flanders, also walked before, bearing
before him the sword of the kingdom. Other dukes, counts,
ami barons also preceded and followed him, each being appointed
to perform some duty therein, according as the king had com-
manded them. But king Louis, his father, labouring under
old age and a paralytic malady, was unable to be present at
his coronation ; for, as he was returning from England and
staying at Saint Denis, being struck by a sudden chill, he
had an attack of paralysis, and lost the use of the right side
of his body.

In the same year died Roger, bishop of "Worcester, at Tours,
where he was buried. In this year, also, died William, earl
of Aumarle, and was buried in his abbey at Tornetun. 48

In this year, the people of Tuscany, Pisa, and Lucca, and
the citizens of Pistoia and of Florence, with the people of the
Val d'Arno, and Ugolino de Valle Spoleta, entered into a con-
federacy to take, by stratagem, Christian, archbishop of Mentz,
chancellor of Frederic, the emperor of the Eomans ; who,
after peace was made between our lord the pope and the said
emperor, at the Eialto, at Venice, had remained in Tuscany,
and by grievous exactions had reduced the people to a distressed
state. Having accordingly arranged their plans, they invited
Conrad, the son of William, marquis of Montferrat, to meet them,
in order that he might take the chancellor by stratagem, as he
greatly hated him, though he had lately made peace with him.
Accordingly, at the instigation of the rest, and at the request
of the emperor Manuel, who promised him the possession 01
abundant wealth if he should capture the before-named chan-
cellor, Conrad came with a strong force to the city of Camerina,
whither the chancellor had come with a few of his followers,
and laying hands on him made him prisoner, and, putting him
in irons, carried him away with him, and first incarcerated him
in a castle which bears the name of Santo Flaviano, and next
imprisoned him at Rocca Venaise, and a third time at Agua-
pendente ; then, delivering him into the charge of his bro-
ther, Boniface, Conrad himself set out for Constantinople to
visit the emperor Manuel, at whose suggestion he had taken
the before-mentioned chancellor. As he did not dare to return

home, in consequence of the injury he had done to Frede-
ric, the emperor of the Romans, in taking his chancellor
prisoner, he remained with Manuel, the emperor of Constan-
tinople, and married one of the nieces of that emperor; on
hearing of which, his brother, Boniface, who had kept the
above-named Christian, archbishop of Mentz and chancellor to
the emperor, in prison, received from him twelve thousand
perpera, 49 and set him at liberty.

In the year of grace 1180, being the twenty-sixth year of
the reign of king Henry, son of "the empress Matilda, the said
king was in England, at Nottingham, on the day of the Na-
tivity of our Lord ; at which festival, William, king of the
Scots, was also present. In this year also, Philip, the king of
the Franks, seeing that his father was severely afflicted with
a paralytic disease, followed in every respect the advice of
Philip, earl of Flanders. Listening to his counsels, he began to
practise tp-anny over his people, and despised and hated all
whom he knew to be the familiar friends of his father : his
own mother too, he persecuted to such a degree, that he drove
her out of his dominions ; his uncles also, William, archbishop
of Eheims, count Theobald, and count Stephen, he subjected to
great persecutions.

At their entreaty, Henry, king of England, the son, crossed
over to England, and told his father of the excesses and vex-
atious conduct which Philip, king of France, was guilty of
towards his mother and his uncles, by the advice of the earl of
Flanders ; on hearing which, the king of England, the father,.-
with the king of England, the son, before Easter, crossed over to
Normandy. Accordingly, they were met in Normandy by the
oueen of the Franks before-named, accompanied by count Theo-
oald and count Stephen, her brothers, and many other noblemen
of the kingdom of France : who, giving hostages to the king of
England, the father, and making oath that they would not
neglect to follow his advice, became his adherents. After this,
the king of England, the father, levied a great army throughout
lu's dominions on both sides of the sea, purposing, after Easter,
to enter the territories of the king of France in a hostile man-
ner, for the purpose of avenging the injuries which the new

king of France had been guilty of towards Ms mother and his
uncles.

After Easter, Philip, king of France, took to wife the
daughter of the earl of Hainault, and niece of Philip, earl of
Flanders, being the daughter of his sister ; and as a marriage
portion with his niece, the said earl of Flanders gave the
whole territory of Vermandois as far as the river Lis. Upon
this, Philip, king of France, determined to have himself and
his wife crowned on the day of Pentecost at the city 01
Sens ; but, by the advice of the earl of Flanders, he short-
ened the intervening time, and caused himself and his wife
to be crowned on Ascension day at Saint Denis, by the arch-
bishop of Sens. "When William, archbishop of Bheims, came
to know of this, he was greatly incensed, and made com-
plaint to Alexander, the Supreme Pontiff, of the intrusion 01
the archbishop of Sens, who, contrary to law and the dignity
of the church of Bheims, had had the presumption to crown
the king of France.

After this, Philip, king of France, and Henry, king of
England, the father, held a conference between Gisors and
Trie ; at which, the king of England, partly by gentle words
and partly by threats, prevailed upon the king of France, in
spite of the advice of the earl of Flanders, to banish from his
mind all the displeasure and indignation which he had felt to-
wards his mother and his uncles, and to receive them again
into their wonting favour, covenanting to allow his mother every
day seven pounds of Paris money for her daily support, and
after the decease of his father, to pay her dower entire and in
full, retaining, however, in his own hands the castles and for-
tified places. At the same conference, by way of making se-
curity more sure, the king of England, the father, in presence
of Philip, king of France, received homage from Philip, earl of
Flanders, and for the said homage granted him one thousand
marks of silver yearly, to be received out of the exchequer at
London ; on condition, however, that in return for the said one
thousand marks the earl of Flanders should find each year
five hundred knights to serve the king of England for the
space of forty days, whenever he should be called upon so to do.

In the same year, Louis, king of the Franks, departed this
life at Paris, in the month of September, it being the four-
teenth day before the calends of October, and the fifth day of

the week, and was buried at the abbey of Barbeaux ; after
which, Philip, king of France, and Henry, king of England,
the father, met and held a conference between Gisors and Trie,
where they made a treaty of peace and reconciliation, which
was established on both sides by word and oath, and was to
the following effect :

" I, Philip, by the grace of God, king of the Franks, and I,
Henry, by the same grace, king of the English, do will that it
shall come to the notice of all, both present as well as to
come, that we have renewed the treaty and friendship, by word
and oath, which my liege lord, Louis, king of the Franks,
and I, Henry, concluded between ourselves before Ivery, in
presence of Peter, titular of Saint Chrysogonus, cardinal priest
and legate of the Apostolic See, and of Richard, bishop of Win-
chester, and many other bishops, earls, and barons who were
then present ; to the effect, that we now are, and wish henceforth
to be, friends, and that each will protect the other in life and
limb, and will defend his worldly possessions to the utmost of
his ability against all men. And if any person whatsoever
shall presume to do an injury to either of us, I, Henry, will
aid Philip, king of France, my liege lord, against all men
to the utmost of my ability. And I, Philip, will aid Henry,
king of England, against all men to the utmost of my ability,
as my liege and vassal, saving always the fidelity which we
owe to our liegemen, so long as they shall preserve their fealty
towards ourselves. And neither of us shall from henceforth
harbour an enemy of the other in his dominions, from the
time that demand shall be made of him. And to the end
that from henceforth all matter of discord between us may be
removed, we do mutually agree that of the lands and pos-
sefsions, and all other things which we now hold, each shall
henceforth make no claim whatever against the other (except
the claim as to Auvergne, respecting which there is a dispute
between us, and except the fee of Chateau-Raoul, and ex-
cept some small fees and allotments of our lands in Berry),
in case our liegemen shall take anything from each other
or from either of us. And if we shall not be able to agree as
to the matters which are above excepted, then in such case, I,
Philip, king of the Franks, have chosen three bishops, those
of Claremont, Nivernois, and Treves, and three barons, count
Theobald, count Robert, and Peter de Touraine, my uncles ;






522 ANNALS OF BOGEK DE HOVEDEX. A.D. 1180.

and I, Henry, king of England, have chosen three bishops,
William, bishop of Le Mans, Peter, hishop of Perigord, and Eo-
bert, bishop of JSTantes, and three barons, Maurice de Crony,
William Maingot, and Peter de Mont Rabell, to act in my be-
half; and, having examined into the truth on both sides, both
themselves as well as by the oaths of the people of those
lands, the bishops aforesaid shall assert upon their word of
truth, and the laymen shall make oath, that whatsoever they
shall find to belong to either as of right, that same they will
declare, and in good faith will firmly abide by their decision.
But if all those bishops whom I, Philip, have chosen, shall
not be able to be present, we will nevertheless abide by the
decision of such two as shall be present ; and if all the barons
named on my side shall not be present, still we will not hesi-
tate to abide by the decision of such two of them as shall be
present; and similarly as to those, whom I, Henry, have
chosen, both bishops as well as barons. We have also made
oath, that we will do no injury to them by reason of their
speaking the truth. And if by chance, which God forbid,
any dispute shall arise between us as to our territories, the
same is to be settled by the same persons in good faith and
without evil intent or delay. And if any one of the persons
before-mentioned shall in the meantime depart this life, then
another one is to be substituted in. his stead. And if either of
us shall think proper to go on a pilgrimage, the one who re-
mains shall faithfully guard, and protect, and defend against
all men, the lands and vassals of him who shall be abroad as
though they were his own and part of his own dominions,
just as though I, Philip, were defending my city of Paris as if it
were besieged, and as though I, Henry, were defending my city
of Rouen, if it were besieged. I, Philip, also do will that all
merchants and other persons whatsoever, both clergy as well
as laymen, coming from the dominions of Henry, king of
England, shall, with all their property, be in security and enjoy
peace throughout all my dominions. And I, Henry, do in.
like manner, will that all merchants and other persons what-
soever, both clergy as well as laymen, coming from the domi-
nions of Philip, king of France, shall, with all their property,
be in security and enjoy peace throughout all my dominions.
All the above we have made promise both by word and by oath
that we will observe. Also, in obedience to our commands,

our vassals have made oath after us, that in good faith they
will counsel us to observe what we have sworn, and not give
us advice to disregard the same."

In the same year, Frederic, emperor of the Eomans, expelled
from his kingdom Henry, duke of Saxony ; the cause of whoso
expulsion was as follows : It must first, however, be observed,
that there were ten princes appointed to be custodians of the
gates of the city of Cologne, whose names were as follows :

The duke of Lemburg,

The duke of Saxony, -

The duke of Saringes,

The duke of Saxland,

The duke of Louvaine,

The count de Wilch,

The count de Loo,

The count de Gerle,

The count Palatine of the Rhone,

The count de Larmval.

Now, these ten are liegemen of the archbishop of Cologne, and
receive yearly from the property of Saint Peter at Cologne two
thousand marks of silver, as the pay for their custodianships. In
addition to this, the archbishop of Cologne has large revenues,
most of which are in the dukedom of Saxony, and which
Henry, duke of Saxony, the son-in-law of Henry, king of Eng-
land, unjustly seized, and withheld from the archbishop. In
consequence of this, Reginald, archbishop of Cologne, made
complaint to his lord, Frederic, emperor of the Romans: in
addition to which, the before-named emperor charged the afore-
said duke with perjury, with breach of faith, and with high
treason towards himself; and caused him to be summoned to ap-
peftr in his court to give satisfaction both to himself and to the
archbishop of Cologne. Having received, therefore, a safe con-
duct both in coming and returning, the duke made his appear-
ance ; and, after many charges had been made against him,
both as to his breach of faith, his perjury, his high treason to-
wards the emperor, and the injuries he had committed to-
wards the archbishop of Cologne, when it was his duty, after
taking counsel with his own people, to make answer to the
charges so made, he mounted his horse, and, without giving
any answer, returned home ; on which the emperor demanded
that judgment should be pronounced against him, and he was



524 ANNALS OF BOGER DE HOVEDEN, A. D. 1180.

accordingly pronounced to have forfeited his dukedom ; and
leave was given to the archbishop of Cologne to enter the terri-
tories of the duke of Saxony with an armed force, in order to
take revenge for the injuries which the duke had done him.
The emperor also, with a great army, entered the territories of
the duke of Saxony, and laid them waste with fire, and sword,
and famine, and reduced the duke to such extremities that he
placed himself at the mercy of the emperor, abjured his ter-
ritory, and placed the same for seven years at the mercy of
the emperor, and then came in exile to the court of Henry,
king of England, his wife's father. Shortly after this, how-
ever, at the entreaty of Alexander, the Supreme Pontiff, Philip,
king of France, Henry, king of England, and Philip, earl of
Flanders, the emperor remitted four years from the period of
banishment which he had prescribed to the duke.

In the same year died Manuel, emperor of Constantinople ;
and Alexis his son, who had married the daughter of Louis,
king of France, ascended the throne, and reigned in peace two
years. However, in the meantime, his mother, Mary, daughter
of Raymond, prince of Antioch, had a certain person as her
paramour, who, by virtue of his office, was in the Greek lan-
guage called " Protosouastos," 50 and in Latin, " Comes Pala-
tinus ;" 51 whom the before-named empress loved with such a
disgraceful and ungovernable passion, that she was ready to put
her son Alexis, the emperor, to death, and thereby promote
her lover to the imperial throne. Accordingly, on a day that
seemed suitable for the purpose, she gave a poisonous draught
to her son the emperor ; after drinking which, the poison,
spreading its influence throughout his tender limbs, almost
suffocated him on the spot : but at length, by means of the
antidotes of skilful physicians, with considerable difficulty he
escaped with his life. Being determined to take due precau-
tions for the future, he sent for Androneus, the brother's
son of his father Manuel, and associated him with himself
on the throne ; by whose advice he seized his mother, and
threw her into prison, and after she had long pined in prison,
caused her to be tied up in a sack, and, an anchor being
fastened to her neck, to be drowned in that part of the sea which

is called " The Greater Sea." He also put out the eyes of the
Protosouastos, his mother's paramour, and caused him to be
emasculated.

A short time after this, Androneus, seeing that it would
give great satisfaction to the people, by way of proof of his
true fidelity and his extreme affection, on a certain day
named for the celebration of the solemnity, carried Alexis, the
emperor, on his shoulders from his palace to the church of
Saint Sophia, and caused him to be crowned there by Basilius,
the patriarch of the city, and, in the presence of all the
people, took the oaths of fealty to him as his liege lord against
all men whatsoever. After this was done, the emperor Alexis
gave to the before-named Androneus the power of exercising
his own will and dispensing justice among the people. How-
ever, after a considerable time, Androneus came to the emperor
Alexis and said that the people refused to pay obedience to his
' commands, and requested him to appoint some one else over the
I people whose commands they would obey. On this, Alexis said
' to him : "I have made choice of yourself, and have appointed
[ you over my people, and I know of no one else in whom I
have greater confidence ;" upon which, Androneus said in reply :
[ " If it is your wish that I should govern your people, cause
i me to be crowned in their presence, so that all the people may
I know that I am, under you, to reign over all the nations which
iare subject to your sway." The emperor, not being aware that
i all power is averse to a partner therein, acceded to his request.
The clergy and people of the empire having been convened,
tthe emperor caused himself and Androneus to be crowned to-
(igether by the before-named patriarch, in the church of Saint
^Sophia. However, after a short period of time had elapsed,
thetme became jealous of the other, and the thing that pleased
Itthe one displeased the other. " For no trust is there in asso-
iciates in rule, and all power is averse to a partner therein." 52
xAndroneus, however, still pretending the affection which he had
hitherto shown, under the veil thereof plotted against his lord
the emperor, who, suspecting nothing of the sort, forbore to
take any precautions. " For no foe is there more pernicious
than an enemy in the disguise of a friend." 53 Having, there-

fore, gained a favourable time and place, with the sanction of
Basilius, the patriarch, he put to death his lord the emperor
Alexis, and, marrying hrs wife Agnes, 53 * the daughter of the
king of France, exercised great tyranny over the people ; and
not only over the people, for all the nobles of the empire as
well he either put to death, or, depriving them of their eyes and
their virility, drove them out of the empire.

There was in that neighbourhood a certain young man, Isaac
by name, son of the sister of Manuel, the deceased emperor,
who, seeing the tyrannical conduct Androneus was guilty of
towards the principal men of the empire, was in great dread of
him, and flying from before his face, assembled a large army,
and fought a battle with the sultan of Iconium ; in which
battle he was taken prisoner by Eupin de la Montaigne, who
had come as an auxiliary to the sultan of Iconium. After
taking him prisoner, he offered to deliver him to the sultan
of Jconium, but the sultan, refusing to receive him, gave him
up to Rupin. Upon returning home, the latter sent him to
his superior lord, Raymond, prince of Antioch, who received
him with great delight, and demanded of him sixty thousand
besants 54 as his ransom, which he accordingly promised to give,
and, sending his messengers to the wealthy men of Cyprus, re-
quested their assistance in procuring his ransom. Complying
with his wishes, they sent him thirty thousand besants, which
he gave to the prince of Antioch, and, by way of security for
payment of the rest of the debt, gave him his son and daughter
as hostages ; whereupon, being liberated from the prison of
the prince of Antioch, he came to the island of Cyprus, on which
the chief men of the island received him, and made him their
ruler. Elated by this, in his vanity he caused an imperial
crown to be made for himself, and had himself crowned and
called the " Holy Emperor." At the time, however, that had
been arranged upon between them, the prince of Antioch sent
to him for the remainder of the debt, that is to say, for the
thirty thousand besants, but the emperor of Cyprus refused to
deliver them to the envoys of the prince, but delivered them
to the brethren of the Temple to be conveyed to the prince of

Antioch. On their departure, they were met hy pirates, who
took from them the said sum of money. When this became
known to the emperor of Cyprus, he asserted that this had
been done hy the contrivance of the prince of Antioch, and
swore that he would not again pay him that sum of money.
In consequence of this, his son and daughter remained two
years as hostages in the hands of the prince of Antioch ;
but he, at length finding that the emperor of Cyprus would
not redeem his hostages, and being moved with compassion,
gave them their liberty, and allowed them to depart.

In the mean time, by the advice and assistance of Basi-
lius, the patriarch, Androneus, the emperor of Constantinople,
usurped the monarchy of the whole empire, and placed the
imperial diadem on the heads of himself and of his wife, and
persevering in his tyrannical course, having put out the eyes
of some of the nobles of the empire and cut off the limbs ol
others, sent them into banishment. Among these there was a
certain nobleman, by name Androneus Angelus, who had been
chancellor to the emperor Manuel, which office was by the
Greeks called "Laucete." 55 Him and his two sons, the em-
peror Androneus caused to be deprived of their sight and virility,
and then banished them from their country.

In addition to these two, the before-named Androneus An-
gelus had a third son, a learned clerk, whom the Greeks called
" Sacwice," 56 while in Latin he was named Tursakius An-
gelus. At the time of the persecution he had set out for France
and resided in Paris, where he frequented the schools,, that in
the learning of the Latins, he might learn their language and
manners. Upon hearing the lamentable misfortunes of his
father and brothers, he set out with all speed to administer
comsolation to them, and as he was passing through a certain
island of Greece he found there a certain religious man, who
had devoted himself to a life of solitude, and had a spirit of
prophecy, and who, having formerly been archbishop of the
city of Tyre, preferring to serve God rather than the world,
had resigned his archbishopric, and had taken up his residence
by himself in that island, his delicacies being the roots of wild
herbs, and draughts of water his drink. On coming to the
holy man, he disclosed to him his name and his family, and the

cause of his journey. When the holy man had heard it all he
burst into tears, knowing that it was a holy thing to weep with
those who weep, and to lament with those who lament. After he
had given loose to his tears, the young man tried, by all means
in his power, to assuage his sorrow ; on which the aged man
said to him, " Return to the city of Constantinople, and prove
yourself a man, for the Lord will deliver it into your hands,
and you shall rule over it, and shall be emperor, and from you
shall emperors proceed, who shall reign after you ; and behold !
Basilius, the patriarch, and the chief men of the empire are
seeking you that they may become your subjects, and may
have you for their lord and emperor; therefore attempt not
to fly from that which God has prepared and predestined for
you."

Upon this, Tursakius, believing what he said, departed for
the city of Constantinople, in the disguise of a poor man and
a beggar. Not daring to discover himself to the people because
his hour was not yet come, he remained in the suburbs alone,
attended by a single servant, and having but one gelding, and
that weak and lame, and there with patience awaited the
fulfilment of the promise of the holy man beforementioned.
There he was frequently visited by the chief men of the land
and the patriarch, not openly, however, but in secret, by reason
of the fears of the emperor ; who was by this time the object
of universal hatred, and was himself the hater of all men.
Even the patriarch, who had aided in his elevation, he per-
secuted to such a degree, as, against his wish, to build a certain
noble church in the city, and place therein Latin canons,
in consequence of which, to the present day, that church
is called the " Latin Church."

After a considerable time, the aforesaid Androneus, the
emperor, goaded by a bad conscience, was desirous, through his
magicians, to learn if there was still any person whom there was
reason for him to stand in fear of: on which they made answer
to him, " Give us a boy without guilt to slay, and a period of
three days, and we will give you information on what you ask."
Accordingly, a boy without guilt was immediately delivered to
them, whom they offered in sacrifice to the demons, and after
making lengthened investigation in his blood and entrails by
means of their magical arts, discovered by the signs that the
close of his rule was nigh at hand, and his death at the gate



A.D. 1185. BASPLITTS PRESENTS TTJESAKIUS TO THE PEOPLE. 529

and that he who was to put him to death was in the neigh-
bourhood, and his name was Tursakius Angelus.

Accordingly, on the next day, the above-mentioned magicians
came to the emperor Androneus, and said to him, " Now at
length have your sins overtaken you of which you were guilty
when you sat on your tribunal, oppressing the innocent and
condemning the just blood without a cause. For the day of
your downfall is hastening on ; and lo ! he is close at hand
who shall destroy you and take your empire, and the name of
that person is Tursakius Angelus. After unheard-of torments
as your punishment, he will condemn you to a most cruel
death, and his deeds will be applauded by the lips of the
people, and he himself will become as the very food of those
who tell of his exploits, and will reign over us, and his posterity
will succeed to the sceptre. It is to your own sorrow that you
have deprived his father and brothers of eyesight and other
blessings. At this moment he is in the suburbs of this city ;
therefore expel him, if expel him you can."

Androneus, however, on learning that he was at hand who
was to put him to death, sent his chancellor with some
knights and men-at-arms, for the purpose of seizing him.
On arriving at the place where he lodged, they found the
gates closed ; on which those who went first cried with a
loud voice, " Open the gates for us, open them ; behold !
it is the emperor's chancellor come ;" and then said, "Tur-
Bakius, come forth." Tursakius, seeing that they would
break open the gates if he did not come forth with all speed,
quickly saddled his horse, and, mounting it, girded on his
sword ; and then, opening the gates, he darted forth with the
greatest rapidity, and, brandishing his sword, made his way
amfng those who resisted, and, rushing upon the chancellor, cut
off his head. The rest, however, stood quite astounded, and
mot one laid hands on him ; on which, passing through the
midst of them, he entered the city, and going through it came
'to the church of Saint Sophia, where, finding the patriarch
Basilius, he cast himself at his feet, and told him of all that
had happened to him.

On this, the patriarch raising him from the ground, ex-
claimed to the whole of the people there assembled, " Come
hither and behold the man whom the Lord hath chosen to reign
over us ; say, then, what you think thereof." To this they

all made answer, " It pleases us that lie should be our lord,
and that he should reign over us, and that we should ex-
pel this perfidious Androneus, who is destroying us and our
nation." Upon this, the patriarch consented to the wishes
of the people, for he too had the same desire, and forthwith
consecrated him emperor : after which, having celebrated
mass and performed all things with due solemnity, the pa-
triarch took him to his own house, and made a great enter-
tainment for the chief men and tribunes of the city (for it was a
festival), to which a multitude of the people and of the elders
resorted.

In the meantime, the emperor Androneus had come forth
from his palace that he might see the end of Isaac Angelus,
for the purpose of arresting whom he had sent his chancellor ;
but, on hearing that the chancellor was slain and that Isaac
Angelus had been proclaimed emperor, he returned to his
palace, and the gate was shut. On this, the new emperor
came with a great multitude of armed people and laid siege to
the palace of Androneus. Suddenly, there came a great black
raven, of sinister appearance, Avhich, sitting upon a wall of the
palace, right opposite to the emperor Androneus, sent forth at him
an unceasing and ill-boding cawing; upon which, conjecturing
that this was an omen of his downfall and ruin, he seized his
bow and drew it, but when he attempted to aim an arrow at
it, the bow broke : on which, being greatly enraged, he threw
it at his feet, saying, " Now I know of a truth that the day of
my ruin is hastening on, and that the anger of God has fallen
upon me."

While he was still speaking, the followers of the new em-
peror scaled the walls of the palace and took the emperor
Androneus prisoner, and after binding him, delivered him up,
to the new emperor ; who said to him, " Now, through the
righteous judgment of God, have your sins overtaken you, by
which you have deserved His anger, in oppressing the inno-
cent, and slaying your lord, the emperor Alexis, and blinding
my father and my brothers, and other nobles of the king-
dom ; therefore you shall die by the most shocking of deaths;"
after which he delivered him to the torturers, saying, " Take
and scourge him through the streets and lanes of the city,
and you are at liberty to put out one of his eyes, and to
cut off one ear, one hand, and one foot. You must, however,
preserve his life and his other limbs for greater torments."



A.D. 1180. DISPUTE AB TO THE BISHOPRIC OF ST. ANDREW'S. 531

After this command had been fully complied with, the new
emperor delivered him to other tormentors, who, scattering
straw over him, set fire to his sides and burned him till the
whole of his skin was contracted into wrinkles : after which
they fastened him to the tails of horses, and then, dragging
him through the midst of the city, when he was dead, cast his
body outside thereof.

After this, the religious men who lived in that church in
the city, which is called the Latin church, came to the emperor
Tursakius and asked for his body ; on which he gave it to
them, and they buried it in their church, which he had built.
But his hand that had been cut off was suspended by chains
of iron from a gibbet. In the next place, by command of the
emperor Tursakius and the whole clergy and people, it was,
ordered, after due consideration, that whatever Androneus had
commanded to be done should be declared null and void : in
consequence of which, all who by command of Androneus had
gone into exile, returned home. In addition to this, the em-
peror Tursakius slew the two sons of Androneus, and taking
due precaution for the future, deposed the above-named patri-
arch Basilius, and shut him up in a monastery.

He also sent for the person who had foretold to him what
should come to pass, and, contrary to the wishes of the canons
of the church of Saint Sophia, appointed him patriarch : in
consequence of which there arose a division among them, so
that no one would pay obedience to him. As he was a man
of peace and was unwilling to have any contention with
them, he abdicated the patriarchate, on which the emperor
appointed him supreme judge in ecclesiastical matters over
all the churches of his empire. After this, the emperor Tur-
saMus, by the advice of his family, married the daughter of
Bela, king of Hungary, by whom he had sons and daughters,
to one of whom Iloger, king of Sicily, son of Tancred, king of
Sicily, was married.

In the same year, Henry, king of England, the father,
made a new coinage in England, and fined the moneyers
for the baseness of the old coinage. In this year also,
Hichard, bishop of Saint Andrew's, in Scotland, departed
this life, after whose decease there immediately arose a
division as to the election of a bishop. For the canons of
the church of Saint Andrew's elected as their bishop master

lord the pope by the before-named John, the bishop elect.
In consequence of this, Alexander, the Supreme Pontiff, sent
Alexis, subdeacon of the Church at Rome, into Scotland, to
learn the merits of the controversy that existed between John,
the bishop elect, and Hugh, who had been consecrated, and to
put an end to the same.

Upon his arrival in Scotland, after having made lengthened
enquiries in presence of the clergy and the people of the
kingdom, respecting the election of John and of Hugh, and the
consecration of the said Hugh, and having learned that the
before-named John had been canonically elected, and that Hugh,
after appeal had been made to the Roman Pontiff, had been,
violently thrust by the king into the bishopric of Saint Andrew's,
he without any hesitation deposed him from the bishopric of
Saint Andrew's, and by virtue of the authority entrusted to
him, condemned him to perpetual silence. The election also of
John he confirmed, and caused him to be consecrated by the
bishops of Scotland, the king neither forbidding nor opposing
the same, indeed, rather, in conformity with the advice of the
bishops of the kingdom, sanctioning it. But immediately after
his consecration had taken place, the king forbade him to stay
in his kingdom. On the other hand, Hugh conducted himself
as a bishop none the less than before, and, taking with him the
sacramental vessels that belonged to the see, and the crozier and
ring, together with other things which he unlawfully withheld,
departed for Rome ; on which, because he was unwilling t
restore what he had carried away, Alexis excommunicated him,
and the Supreme Pontiff confirmed the sentence ; whereupon
the pope wrote to the following effect to the bishops and other
ecclesiastical men of the kingdom of Scotland :

The letter of pope Alexander relative to John and Hugh, the
bishops of Saint Andrew's.

" Alexander, the bishop, servant of the servants of God,
to his venerable brethren, the whole of the bishops, and his
dearly beloved sons the abbats and other prelates of churches
throughout Scotland appointed, to the prior, canons, clergy,
and people of Saint Andrew's, health and the Apostolic bene-

diction. Inasmuch as we understood that our venerable
brother John, now bishop of Saint Andrew's, was canoni-
cally elected, and that after his election, an appeal then pending,
Hugh, with rash presumption, being thrust into the said church
by lay power, had dared to be consecrated thereto ; therefore,
by our Apostolic authority making null and void his election,
we directed our dear son, Alexis, our subdeacon, as legate of
the Apostolic See, to repair to your parts to take cognizance of
the election of the before-named John ; who, having, as we are
informed by the testimony of many, acted therein with mature
deliberation and in a canonical manner, found his election to
be canonical, and, after many delays, in which he acted in
deference to his royal highness, confirmed the same with the
Apostolic authority, enjoining all on our behalf who belonged
to the church of Saint Andrew's to show due reverence and
obedience to the said John as being duly elected. Whereupon,
inasmuch as no one, by reason of their dread of the king, dared
openly to obey this command, the said legate laid under an
interdict, not the kingdom, as he lawfully might have done,
but the see. Inasmuch therefore as the chief men, both eccle-
siastical as well as secular, having been solemnly bound upon
1 oath by our most dearly beloved son in Christ, William, the
illustrious king of the Scots, to give good counsel thereon,
i while the king himself had strictly promised that he would
abide by their advice, all made answer as one man that he
ought not any further to molest the consecration of the afore-
said John made in presence of our legate and four bishops (the
fifth being sick, but by writing consenting thereto) but allow
him peacefully to be consecrated to his see. Wherefore we
do by this Apostolic writing command the whole of you, and
do, >mder peril of your orders and benefices, enjoin you, that
putting on a spirit of forbearance, you will, within eight days
after the receipt hereof, all appeal set aside, with due honor
reinstate him in his see, and labor prudently and manfully
for the upholding of the rights of the Church, and use all
diligence in appeasing the irritation of the king, and shew all
the respect and honor to the aforesaid bishop which you were
wont to shew to his predecessors. And if the king shall will
any otherwise, or even be warped by the counsels of wicked
men, it is your duty to pay obedience rather to God and to
the holy Church of Rome than to men ; otherwise the sen-

tence which our venerable brother Hugh, bishop of Durham,
has pronounced upon the rebellious and contumacious, 57 we shall,
with God's assistance, confirm and order to be strictly observed."

Another Letter of pope Alexander on the same subject.

" Alexander, the bishop, servant of the servants of God, to
his venerable brethren, and his dearly beloved sons the prelates
of churches appointed throughout Scotland, health and the Apos-
tolic benediction. Whereas it has been notified unto us, that
Hugh, who had been intruded upon the church of Saint An-
drew's in Scotland, having unlawfully withheld the episcopal
vessels, 58 the crozier and ring, and other things which he had
without good reason taken away, and, having been frequently
warned thereon to return to a sense of his duty, despised the
said warnings ; on which our dearly beloved son Alexis, the sub-
deacon and legate of the Apostolic See, in presence of yourselves
and many of the clergy and people, relying upon the Apostolic
authority, called upon him, under pain of excommunication,
within fifteen days either to restore what he had taken away or
carried off, or else to make becoming satisfaction for the same.
And whereas, he, persisting in the sin of his arrogance, has in
no way listened to the warnings of our legate aforesaid. We
therefore of our authority, confirming the sentence pronounced
by him, do by these Apostolic writings order and enjoin the
whole of you, that you do forthwith, relying on the grace of
God, and all fear laid aside, and no appeal whatever with-
standing, denounce him as under the ban of excommunica-
tion, and carefully avoid him as excommunicated, until such
time as he shall restore to our brother, John, bishop of Saint
Andrew's, and his church, such of the things above mentioned
as he has taken away, or an equivalent for the same, and make
proper satisfaction for such other things as he has made away
with."

In addition to this, our lord, the pope, gave to Roger, the
archbishop of York, the legateship in Scotland, and ordered
him, together with Hugh, bishop of Durham, to pronounce
sentence of excommunication upon the king of the Scots, and
place his kingdom under an interdict, unless he should allow
the aforesaid John to hold his bishopric in peace, and give him

were employed by him in the performance of bis sacred offices.

security that he would keep the same. The said pope also,
strictly, and in virtue of the obedience he owed, forbade John,
bishop of Saint Andrew's, either moved by love or fear of
any person, or by any one's suggestion or command, to presume
and dare with rashness to desert the church of Saint Andrew's,
to which he had been consecrated and confirmed with the Apos-
tolic authority, or to receive another ; adding, that if he should
attempt so to do, he would deprive him of both. 59 And with
reference thereto, the Supreme Pontiff wrote to the following
effect

The Letter of pope Alexander to William, Icing of the Scots,
on the same matter.

"Alexander, the bishop, servant of the servants of God,
to William, the illustrious king of the Scots, health and the
Apostolic benediction. We bear it in mind that we have
anxiously laboured for your peace and liberty, hoping that
thereby you would be more strongly confirmed, and increase
apace in dutifulness to the Apostolic See, and would more wil-
lingly preserve the liberties of the Church ; but when we give
our attention to what you have done relative to our venerable
brother John, bishop of Saint Andrew's, in Scotland, and what
disposition you have hitherto shewn with regard to him, we
find ourselves compelled to entertain apprehensions at variance
with the hopes which we did entertain, as to the warmth of
your royal dutifulness. Wishing, nevertheless, to make trial
if our forbearance can bring your royal feelings to true re-
pentance, we do by these Apostolic writings strenuously ad-
monish and enjoin your mightiness, that, within twenty days
after the receipt hereof, you make peace with the said bishop,
ani give security for the same, so that he may have no room
to fear your royal indignation. Otherwise, you are to know
that we have given orders to our venerable brother Roger,
the archbishop of York and legate of the Apostolic See, in
Scotland, to lay your kingdom under an interdict, no appeal
whatever withstanding, and to pronounce sentence of excom-
munication against your person, if you shall be unwilling to
desist from tliis course. And further, be assured of this for
certain, that if you shall think fit to persist in your violent
measures, in the same way, that we have laboured that your

kingdom might gain its liberty, so shall we use our best en-
deavours that it may return to its former state of subjection."

The king of Scotland, however, being in nowise willing
to obey the Apostolic mandates, expelled the said John,
bishop of Saint Andrew's, and Matthew, bishop of Aberdeen,
his uncle, from his kingdom. Accordingly, Roger, archbishop
of York, and Hugh, bishop of Durham, and Alexis, the legate
of the Apostolic See, in obedience to the mandate of the Su-
preme Pontiff, pronounced sentence of excommunication against
the person of the king of Scotland, and laid his kingdom under
interdict.

In the same year, a certain priest, Swerre Birkebain by
name, commenced a war with Magnus, king of Norway.
Now the following were the grounds of the claims which the
before-named Swerre made against the said Magnus, rela-
tive to the kingdom of Norway. Siward and Magnus were
brothers. Siward was king of Norway ; and Magnus, hia
brother, crossed over to Ireland and gained the greater part of
it by arms ; he was the father of Harold, and was shortly
after, slain by the Irish. The said Harold, after the death of
his father, passed over into Norway, to his uncle, king Siward,
and demanded of him a part of that kingdom, on which he
gave him that part of the kingdom which belonged to big
father of right.

Now king Siward had a son, whom he named Magnus,
and a daughter called Christiana, and whom he gave in
marriage to earl Herling, who by her became the father of a
son, whom he named Magnus. On the death of earl Herling,
his son Magnus succeeded him in the earldom ; and shortly
after, a serious disagreement arising between him 60 and Harold,
the said Harold took him prisoner in battle, and blinded him
and deprived him of his virility, and hanged Reginald of
Bergen. Magnus, after losing his sight, became a monk, and
Harold, having obtained the whole kingdom of Norway, be-
came the father of four sons, namely, Ingo, who was legiti-
mate, and Siward, Augustin, and Magnus, who were ille-
gitimate and by different mothers. A certain clerk, Siward
by name, insidiously slew the before-named king Harold by
night, and after his death, taking the before-named Magnus,

60 it will appear in the sequel that this is a mistake ; it was probably
Masnus, the son of Siward, and uncle of this Magnus, who was slain by
Harold.



A.D. 1180. SWERRE SECRETLY ENTERS DRONTHEIM. 537

who was his kinsman, from the abbey, attempted to restore
him to the throne, on which a war ensuing with the sons of
Harold, he was slain, and Magnus, who had been a monk,
shared the same fate.

After their death, Ingo, Si ward, and Augustin, obtained
the kingdom. Siward became the father of Haco, Siward, and
Suer, who were all illegitimate, and born of different mothers.
Augustin had a son who was also named Augustin, and was
of legitimate birth ; while Ingo was the father of Siward and
Augustin. They being slain, th.B before-named Haco slew
Ingo, and obtained the throne. The chief men of the king-
dom being indignant at this, raised Magnus, the son of Herling
and the before-named Christiana, to the throne. Being, how-
ever, unable to make head in war against Haco, they retired
to Denmark, where in a short time having recruited their forces,
they returned to Norway. A battle being fought between
them and Haco at Funenburgh, they gained possession of his
ships and arms, and put him to flight.

In the following summer, Haco was pursued by Magnus,
the son of Herling and Christiana, and a naval engagement
taking place between them at a spot called Vee, Haco was slain,
on which Magnus, the son of Herling and Christiana, gained
the throne. In consequence of this, Siward, the brother of
Haco, rose in rebellion against him, and a battle being fought
between them, Siward was slain ; on which Magnus was made
king ; and was crowned in the fifteenth year of his age and
the second of his reign, being the fourth year of the papacy of
the pope Alexander the Third, who sent to him master Stephen
of Orvieto as legate.

!S T ow, while the before-named king Magnus was celebrating
the festival of the Nativity of our Lord, at Funenburgh, Augus-
tin, the son of the before-named Augustin, surprised him with
a body of horse, and attempted to slay the king while among
his guests ; but the king, being forewarned thereof, went out
against him, and, an engagement taking place, slew him, together
with four hundred of his men. Those, however, who escaped
from the battle, to the amount of eleven hundred warriors, ad-
hered to the before-named Swerre, the priest, the son of Siward.
This Swerre, having levied a large force, on the night after
the feast of Saint Botolph, secretly entered the city of Dron-
theim, where king Magnus, with his father, earl Herling, and



538 AOTTALS OF BOGER DE HOVEDEIf. A. D. 1180.

others of his friends were staying, and surprised them, and
slew a great number. On this occasion there fell earl Herling,
the king's father, John de Randeburgh, who was married to
the king's sister, and Siward, the son of Nicholas, with many
others : the king, however, leaving the city, with some few
of his followers, made his escape. But in the following year, '
king Magnus, levying a considerable army, attacked the before-
named Swerre near the city of Drontheim, and, at the first
onset, slew many of his foes : but at length, by the secret dis-
pensation of God, after many of the best men of his house-
hold had been slain, he took to flight, together with a few of
his followers, and effected his escape.

On this, the priest Swerre pursued him as far as Bergen,
on which the king, flying thence, left him in possession of that
city; and Augustin, the archbishop of Drontheim, being unwil-
ling to make any submission to the priest Swerre, left his arch-
bishopric, and coming to England, excommunicated Swerre.
It deserves to be recorded, that this king Magnus was the first
king of Norway that was crowned.

In the same year, Henry, king of England, the father, ap-
pointed Eanulph de Glanville chief justiciary of all England :
by whose wisdom were enacted the laws underwritten, which
we call the " Anglican Laws."

Of the Laws and Statutes of England, after the Conquest by
William the Elder.

* " Here are set forth the enactments made by William, king
of the English, and his principal men, after the Conquest of Eng-
land. In the first place, before every thing, he desired that
one God should be worshipped throughout his kingdom, that
the one faith of Christ should always be kept inviolate, and
that peace, security and good will should be preserved between
the English and the Normans. ' We do also enact, that every
free man shall on his word and oath affirm, that, whether in
England or out of it, he is willing to be faithful to his
lord, king William, to preserve his territories and honors to
him with all due fidelity, and to defend the same against his
enemies. We do will also, that all men whom we have brought

by a reference to the more full copy of these laws in Wilkins's " Leges
Anglo-Saxonicac." London, 1721, p. 228; et seq.

with us, or who shall have come after us, shall be under our
protection. And if any one of them shall be slain, his supe-
rior lord, if he can, is, within fifteen days, to arrest his mur-
derer ; but if not then, he is to begin to pay to us forty-six marks
of silver, so far as the property of the said lord shall last. But
where the property of the lord shall not suffice, then the
whole hundred, in which the murder took place, shall pay in
common what remains unpaid. Also, every person who is a
Frank by birth, and was in the time of Edward, our kinsman,
residing in England, and subject to 'the customs of the English,
which they call ' Anlote' or ' Anscote,' 61 is to pay the same
according to the laws of the English.' This claim was made
and confirmed in the city of Gloucester. 62 ' We do also forbid
that any live stock shall be sold or bought except within cities,
and then in the presence of three faithful witnesses, and that
anything second-hand 62 * shall be sold without a security and
warranty for the same. And if any person shall do otherwise,
he is to pay back the money, and then a penalty [to the
king].' It was also there enacted, that if a Frank by birth
should accuse an Englishman of perjury, murder, theft, ho-
micide, or ' ran,' 63 whereby is meant open robbery, which can-
not be denied, the Englishman was to defend himself in such
manner as he should think best, either by judgment by
iron, 64 or by wager of battle. But if the Englishman should
happen to be infirm, then he was to find some one to do so in
his stead. If either of them should be conquered, he was to
pay to the king a penalty of forty shillings. ' But if any En-
glishman shall charge a Frank by birth [therewith], and shall
be ready to prove the same by the judgment or by duel, then
our will is, that the Frank shall clear himself by oath, not
[by the judgment] by iron. This also we do command, that
all shall observe the laws of king Edward in all respects, with
the addition of what we have for the benefit of the English
enacted. Every man who shall assert himself to be free, shall
be on suretyship, 63 in order that his surety may produce him

for trial, if guilty of any offence ; and if any such person shall
run away and escape, then the sureties are to see that they
pay the amount claimed, and make proof that they have been
privy to no fraud in the person who has escaped. The same
summons shall be made of hundreds and counties, as our prede-
cessors have enacted : and those who ought in justice to appear,
-and shall be unwilling so to do, shall be once summoned. And if
on a second summons they shall not appear, then one ox shall
be taken, and on a third summons, another ox, and on the fourth
S occasion, the amount claimed shall be paid out of the property of
the said person, by way of what is called ' scapgeld,' besides a
penalty to the king. We do also forbid any person to sell a
man out of the country. We do also forbid that any person
' shall be put to death or hanged for any crime : but his eyes
- may be put out, and he may be deprived of his virility. 65 And
this command is not to be violated, on pain of plenary penalty
to ourselves.'

" King William, in the fourth year of his reign, by the
advice of his barons, caused the nobles and wise men among
the English, and those who were learned in their laws, to be
summoned throughout all the earldoms of England, in order
that he might hear from them their laws, ordinances, and
customs. Accordingly, twelve men, elected from each county
throughout the whole kingdom, first gave assurance by oath,
that, so long as they could, proceeding in the right path and
swerving neither to the right nor to the left, they would dis-
close the enactments of their laws and customs, neither omitting
nor adding, nor by prevarication changing anything. There-
fore, making a commencement with the laws of Holy Mother
Church, inasmuch as through her alone both king and kingdom
have a firm and lasting foundation, they set forth her laws,
liberties, and rights of protection, to this effect : <**



Of Clerks and their Possessions.

" Every clerk, and all scholars 66 as well, and all their pro-
perty and possessions, are everywhere to enjoy the protection
of God and of the Holy Church.

remain a living sign of his treachery and wickedness."

kins, p. 197, et seq., which is far more correct than that found in Hoveden.

Of the Times and Days of the King's Protection.

"From the Ad vent of our Lord until the octave of Epiphany
there is to be the peace of God and of the Church throughout
all the kingdom : and, in like manner, from Septuagesima
until the octave of Easter. Likewise, from the Ascension of our
Lord until the octave of Pentecost. Likewise, on all the days
of the Four Seasons, 67 and on all Saturdays, from the ninth hour
until Monday. Likewise, on the vigils of Saint Mary, Saint
Michael, Saint John the Baptist, of all the Apostles, and of those
Saints whose days are announced by the priests on the Lord's
Day, and of All Saints on the calends of November, always
from the ninth hour of the vigil and during the subsequent
festival. Likewise, in parishes in which the day of dedication
is kept. Likewise, in parishes, when the festival of the Saint
of the church is celebrated. And if any person comes de-
voutly to the festival of the Saint, he is to have protection 68
in going, staying, and returning. Likewise, for all Christians,
when going to Church for the purpose of prayer, there is to
be protection both in going and returning. In like manner,
those who are coming to dedications, synods, and chapters,
whether they have been summoned, or whether they have them-

i selves to perform any part therein, are to enjoy full protection.
Also, if any person who has been excommunicated shall resort
to the bishop for the purpose of absolution, in going and return-

i ing he is to have the protection of God and of the Holy Church :
and if any person shall do him any injury, the bishop is to do
justice upon him. And if any arrogant person shall refuse to
make amends on judgment given by the bishop, then the bishop
is ^o make the same known to the king : and in such case the
king will compel the offender to make amends to the person
to whom he has done such injury, that is to say, in the first
place to the bishop, and then to the king ; and thus, in such
case, there will be two swords, and the one sword shall aid the
other.

c ' These were the four seasons for fasting prescribed by the early Ro-
man church, styled the Vernal, ^Estival, Autumnal and Iliemal fasts, or
the fasts of the first, fourth, seventh, and tenth month ; March being
reckoned as the first month.

68 In these latter cases, " pax," " peace," or " protection," means merely
protection from legal process.

Of the jurisdiction of the Holy Church.

" Wherever the king's justice shall hold his sittings, or who-
ever the person whose cause he shall be occupied with, if a
person sent by a bishop shall come there and open a cause of
the Holy Church, the same is to be first brought to a con-
clusion ; for it is just that God should be everywhere held in
honor before man.

Of all who hold of the Church.

" "Whoever shall hold anything of the Church, or shall have a
tenement upon the lands of the Church, he shall not, though he
may have committed an offence, be forced to plead out of the
ecclesiastical court, unless, which God forbid, there shall have
been a miscarriage of justice in such ecclesiastical court.

Of the accused who take refuge with the Church.

" Whatever accused or guilty person shall flee to a church
for the sake of protection, from the time that he shall have
reached the porch of such church, he shall on no account be
seized by any one pursuing him, except only by the bishop or
by his servant. And if, on his flight, he shall enter the house
of a priest or his court-yard, he is to have the same security
and protection as he would have had in the church, suppos-
ing always, that the priest's house and court-yard are standing
upon the land of the Church. If the person is a thief or burglar,
that which he has wrongfully taken, if he has it in his posses-
sion, he is to restore, and if he has entirely made away with
it, and has anything of his own by which to make restitution,
he is to make restitution in full to him whom he has injured.
And if the thief has thus acted according to his usual prac-
tice, and shall happen to have frequently made his escape to
churches and priests' houses, then, after making restitution of
what he has taken away, he is to abjure that county, and not
to return thereto ; and if he does not 67 make restitution, no one
is to presume to harbour him, unless with leave granted by the
king.

Of breach of the Protection of the Church.

" If any person shall by force violate the protection of the
Holy Church, the same belongs to the jurisdiction of the bishops.
( And if the guilty person shall, by taking to flight or by arro-
gantly slighting it, despise their sentence, then complaint is to

be made against him before the king after the expiration of
forty days, and the king's justice shall exact of him surety and
jjpledges, if he can give the same, until he shall have made satis-
} faction, first to God, and then to the king. And if for one-and-
thirty days he shall not be able to be found, either by his friends
and acquaintances, or by the king's justice, then the king shall
outlaw him by the word of his mouth. And if he shall after-
wards be found, and can be taken, he is to be delivered alive to
the king, and if he defends himself, then his head. For from
the day of his outlawry he has the head of a wolf; which
in the English language is called ' Wulvesheofod.' M And this
is the common and universal law as to all outlaws.

Of the Tithes of the Church.

" Of all yearly produce of the earth the tenth sheaf is due to
God, and ought therefore to be paid to Him. If any person has
a stud of mares, he is to give the tenth foal : he who has only one
or two, is for each foal to pay one penny. In the same manner,
Jxe who has a number of cows is to give the tenth calf ; if only
lone or two, he is to pay for each calf one penny. He also who
makes cheese is to give the tenth thereof to God, and if he
does not make it, then he is to give the milk every tenth day.
iln like manner, the tenth lamb, the tenth fleece, the tenth of
the butter, and the tenth sucking-pig is to be given.

Of small Tillies*

" In like manner, as to the tenths of the profits of bees.
jlMoreover, out of forests, meadows, waters, mills, parks, pre-
serves, fisheries, shrubberies, gardens, merchandize, and all
fother things which the Lord has given, the tenth part is to be
restored to Him who has bestowed the other nine parts to-
gether with the tenth. The person who withholds the same
fmust be compelled to make payment thereof by judgment of
i<the bishop, and of the king, if necessary. For thus did Saint
Augustin teach, and these things were conceded by the king,
ithe barons, and the people. But since then, by the instigation
)f the devil, many have withheld the same, and rich priests,
'Decoming negligent, have not taken care to undergo the trouble
)f seeking them, because they had sufficient necessaries for the

awry was so called, from its resemblance to that of the wolves which iu-
'ested England, for whose heads a reward was offered.

support of life. But in many places there are now three or
four churches where there was then hut one, and thereby their
means have become diminished.

Of those who have been adjudged by the Icing's justice to undergo
the judgment of iron or of water.

" On the day on which the judgment is to be held, the bishop
is to come thither with his clergy, and in like manner the king's
justice with lawful men of that county, who are to see and hear
that all things are done with equity. Those whom the Lord
in His mercy, and not through their own merits, shall think fit
to save, are to be unmolested and to depart at liberty, and
the king's justice is to pronounce judgment on those whom
the iniquities of their crimes and not the Lord has con-
demned. As to those barons who have jurisdiction over their
homagers in their own courts, they are to see that they so act
towards them, that they neither incur guilt before God, nor
offend the king. And if a trial takes place in any of their
courts of those who are homagers of other barons, then the
king's justice must be present at such trial, inasmuch as, with-
out his presence, the said trial may not be brought to a con-
clusion. But if any baron shall happen not to have jurisdic-
tion in the hundred where the trial takes place, then the mat-

Of Saint Peter's Penny, which in England is called Romescot.

" Every person who shall have live stock to the value ot
thirty pence on his property belonging to himself, shall, ac-
cording to the law of the English, give one penny to Saint Peter,
and according to the law of the Danes, half a mark. The
said penny is to be mentioned on the feast of Saint Peter and
Saint Paul, and to be collected on the feast which is called that
of ' Saint Peter ad Vincula,' 93 so as not to be withheld beyond
that day. If any person shall withhold the same, then the
claim is to be brought before the king's justice, inasmuch as thif
penny is the king's alms ; and the justice is to cause the penny
to be paid, as also a fine to the bishop and to the king. And il
any person shall chance to have more houses than one, then a*
to that one in which he shall be residing at the feast of the
apostles Saint Peter and Saint Paul he is to pay the penny.

What 'Danegeld' is, and under what emergency it was first levied.
-"The payment of Danegeld was first exacted by reason of
the pirates. For, harassing this country, they used their
utmost endeavours to lay it waste. In order to check
their ravages, it was enacted, that Danegeld should be paid
yearly ; namely, twelve pence for each hide of land through-
out the whole country, for the purpose of hiring persons to
resist the incursions of the pirates. From this Danegeld all
the Church was free and exempt, and all the land which be-
longed to the Church as of its own demesne, wherever situate ;
it paying nothing whatever towards such a tax, because more
trust was put in the prayers of the Church than in its defence by
arms. [And the English 69 church enjoyed this exemption down
to the times of William the Younger, who was surnamed Rufus,
when he required aid from the barons of England in order
to regain Normandy and retain possession of it against his
brother Robert, surnamed Curthose, who was setting out for
Jerusalem. It was conceded to him, though not sanctioned
or confirmed by law ; but by reason of the necessity of the
case, he caused four shillings to be paid to him for every hide
of land, that of the Church not even excepted. While the
collection of the tax was being made, the Holy Church pro-
tested against it, demanding her exemption, but she availed
nothing thereby.]

Of the various kinds of the Sing's Protection, along the Four

Streets or Royal Roads, and along rivers, by the navigation of

which provisions are carried.

" The king's protection is of various kinds. One kind is
given under his own hand, which is called by the English
4 Cyninges hande sealde grith.' One kind is that which lasts

r\ period of eight days from the time of his coronation.
There are also eight days at the Nativity of our Lord, eight
jdays at Easter, and eight at Pentecost. Another protection
is that given by his letters. Another, that which the Four
public Roads possess, Watlingstrete, 70 Fosse/ 1 Ikenildestrete, 72

69 This must be an interpolation, if these laws belong to the time of
Edward the Confessor and William the Conqueror. The more general
opinion now is, that they belong to the time of William II.

and Ermingstrete ; two of which extend along the length
and two along the breadth of the kingdom. Another is that
which the waters of certain rivers known by name possess,
by the navigation of which provisions are carried from dif-
ferent places to cities or boroughs. This protection under
the king's hand, on the day of his coronation, and under his
letters, is to be observed under penalty of a fine : in like
manner a breach of the protection on the four public roads and
the principal rivers is to be deemed equal to assault. If
any building is erected [on the said roads or rivers], the same
shall be destroyed, and one half of the expenses of the repairs
thereof shall be paid. And if a person shall knowingly have
committed such breach, the fine is to be paid by the eighteen
hundreds, 75 in places subject to the Danish laws, 76 and his body
shall be at the king's mercy. According to the law of the En-
glish, his were, 77 that is to say, the price of his ransom is to
be the same as the manbote payable to the lords for those of
their men who have been slain. The manbote, according to
the Danish laws, for a villein or a sokeman, is twelve oras j 79
but for free men, three marks. But manbote, according to the
law of the English, is three marks to the king, and to the
archbishop, for the men who belong to them ; but to the bishop
and to the earl of the same county, and to the king's seneschal
it is twenty shillings ; and to other barons, ten shillings. Also,
a recompense is to be paid to the relations of the person slain,
or the duel is to be waged with them, as to which the English
proverb says, ' Bige spere of side other here.' * Protection,
however, upon the Four public Roads and the before-mentioned
rivers lies under a higher jurisdiction than what we have men-
tioned as to assault. Also, if a mill, or fishery, or any other
work that is an obstruction to them is in preparation, the
said works must be immediately destroyed, and the public

Roads and rivers must be placed in their former state of repair,
and a fine to the king must not be forgotten. The lesser
roads, however, leading from one city to another, and from
borough to borough, and along which merchandize is carried
and other business done, are to be subject to the laws of the
county ; and if any person erects any work to their detriment,
the same is to be levelled with the ground, and the roads are to
be at once put in repair, and reparation is to be made, accord-
ing to the law of the said county, to the earl and sheriff thereof.
The same is to be done likewise as to the lesser rivers. As to
the lesser rivers which carry vessels with the things that are
necessary to boroughs and cities, wood, at least, and things of
that nature, reparation of them is likewise to be made as pre-
scribed by the law relative to the lesser roads.

Of the Divisions of the Shires.

" The divisions of the king's Shires properly belong to the
same jurisdiction as the four Royal public Roads. The division
Jinto Hundreds and Wapentakes, with their jurisdiction, belong
to the earls and sheriffs of the counties. Treasures found in
ithe ground belong to our lord the king, unless they are found in
a church or in a burial-ground. And even if found there, the
gold belongs to the king, and a moiety of the silver, and the
other moiety to the church where it is found, whatever church
it is, whether rich or poor.

Of the Laws as to Murderers.

" If a person was murdered anywhere, the murderer was
sought throughout the vill where the person murdered was
found. If he was found, he was to be delivered up to the king's
justice, within eight days after the murder. If he could not be
foutfd, then a period of a month and a day was given for
making search for him ; and if within the given period he
3ould not be found, then six and forty marks were levied
upon the vill. But if it was not able to make so great a
payment, then the amount was to be paid by the hundred
which the vill was unable to pay. But when the boundaries of
the vill were utterly confused, then the barons were to see that
.t was collected throughout the hundred, and was sealed with the
*eal of some baron of the county, and then carried to the king's
treasurer, who was to keep the same under seal for a year and
i day. If the murderer could bo found within that time,

> x 2



548 ANNALS OF EOGEE DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1180.

then he was to be delivered up to the king's justice, on which they
were to have back the forty-six marks that had been deposited
with the king's treasurer. But if he could not be apprehended
within the said time, then the relations of the murdered person
were to have six marks and the king the remaining forty. If
his relations could not be found, then his superior lord was to
receive them, and if he had no lord, then his fellow, e3 that is
to say, the person who was tied to him by bonds of fidelity.
But if there were none of these, in such case, the king of the
realm, under whose safeguard and protection they all live, was
to take back the six marks together with his own forty.

" The law of murder was first enacted in the time of Canute,
the Danish king, who, after gaining possession of England,
and reducing it to a state of peace, at the request of the English
barons, sent his army back to Denmark. The said barons,
however, became surety to the king, that as many of his people
as he should wish to retain with himself should enjoy assured
protection in all respects ; and that if any of the English should
happen to slay one of them, and could not defend himself
against the charge, by the judgment of God, that is to say, by
judgment of water or of iron, justice should be executed upon
him ; and that if he should take to flight, then payment was
to be made as mentioned above.

Of the Duties of the King.

" The king, as being the viceregent of the Supreme King,
is appointed for the purpose of shewing due respect to and
protecting the worldly kingdom, and the people of God, and,
above all things, His Holy Church, and of ruling and de-
fending it from those who would injure it, and of removing
from it, and crushing and utterly dispersing all evil-doers ; and
if he does not do so, then the name of king will not belong
to him, pope John truly testifying that he loses the name
of king who does not act as king. [On Pepin 84 and his son
Charles, who were not yet kings, but only princes under the
king of the Franks, hearing this definite opinion, pronounced
as truthfully as prudently on the name of a king, quoted by
William the Bastard, king of England, they foolishly wrote
to the pope to enquire if on those terms the kings of the Franks

A.D. 1180. THE LAWS OF HENKY THE SECOND. 549

were to remain contented solely with the name of king. On
which they received for answer that those ought to be called
kings who watch, defend, and govern the Church of God and
His people, in imitation of the Royal Psalmist, who says, ' He
that worketh vanity shall not dwell in my house.' 86 ]

Of the guilty condemned by Law who have recourse to the king's
mercy.

" If a person guilty of a capital offence shall ask the king's
mercy for his crime, in his fear of death or of loss of limb,
the king may, by the law of his dignity, pardon him if he
pleases, even though he be deserving of death. The male-
factor, however, shall make redress, so far as he shall be
able, for the offence of which he has been guilty, and shall give
sureties that he will keep the peace and observe the laws ; and
if such sureties shall not be forthcoming, he shall be banished
the country.

What those are to do whom the Icing shall think proper to deliver
from death,

" The king has also another prerogative of mercy as to those
who are under arrest. For wherever he shall come, whether into
city, borough, castle, vill, or even in the road, if a person shall
be under arrest, it is in his power, by a single word, to re-
lease him from such arrest. The person released shall, however,
make satisfaction to the person against whom the crime was
committed. But as to a murderer, traitor, or criminal of that
description, although the king shall pardon them as to life and
limb, they shall on no account with the sanction of the law
remain in the country ; but shall immediately make oath that
they will go to the sea-shore within a time prescribed to them
I by^he justice, and will immediately, as soon as they find a ship
and a fair wind, cross the seas. And if, being forsworn, they
shall afterwards remain in this country, whoever shall be able
to find them, may execute summary justice on them without
judgment pronounced; and if any person shall gratuitously
harbour them for a single night only he shall be fined according
to the greater law of the English or of the Danes, on the second
occasion twofold, and for the third offence he shall be adjudged
to be the associate and accomplice of malefactors.

Of the wives of malefactors and their children.

" If any such shall have wives living in this country, and
any one of the relatives of the person murdered shall say that
they were accomplices in the crime, they shall make proof of
their innocence by the judgment of God ; and if the mercy
of God and their own innocence shall save them, they may
continue to be lawful persons with their dowries and marriage
portions. But children who, before commission of the crime,
were born or begotten, are not to lose their lawful rights for a
crime committed after they were begotten, nor are they to be
deprived of their right of heirship.

What " Frithborg" means, or the oath of the Ten Men, which the
people of York call " Tenemental."

'' There is likewise one great and especial institution, by means
'f which all people are kept in a state of the greatest security,
namely, where each person giving that pledge for himself on a
certain security, which the English call ' Freoborger.' * The
people of York, however, and they only, call it ' Tien manna
tala,' 89 which means ' The number often men.' This surety was
exercised in the following manner ; Inasmuch as all men in
all vills throughout the whole kingdom were bound to be di-
vided into frank-pledges of ten, if one of the ten were guilty
of an offence, there would be nine to force him to make re-
dress ; and if he took to flight, a term of thirty- one days by
law was granted them. On the person being sought for, and
found, he was taken before the king's justice, and out of his
property reparation was instantly made for the injury he had
done ; and if after that he was guilty of any offence, then
justice was executed upon his body. But if within the time
before-mentioned he could not be found, then, as there was in
every frithborg one head man whom they called ' Freoborger
heofod,' 90 this head man would choose two of the best men of
his own frithborgers, and then of the three frithborgs that
were nearest, he would take the head man of each, and two of

88 Frank-pledge, or surety given by ten men for the good behaviour of
the eleventh.

person bound for himself and his neighbour, was called a " decennier."

the best men of each of those frithborgs, if he could find them,
after which, himself being the twelfth, he would purge himself
and his own frithborg of the offence, if he could, and of the
escape of the said malefactor. If he could not do this, then
he and his frithborg were to make good the loss out of the
property of the malefactor so far as it would go, and on that
falling short, make up the amount from the property of him-
self and his frithborg, and so account to the justice for the
amount legally adjudicated against them. Then last of all
the nine would swear by themselves that they had been unable
to make satisfaction therein according to their oath, by means
of the three nearest frithborgs, and that they would in nowise
be guilty thereof, and that if they should ever be able to cap-
ture him, they would bring him to the justice, or inform the
justice where he was.

That all persons are to establish Frithborgs for their servants and
dependants.

" Archbishops, bishops, earls, and barons, are also to have
their own knights and yeomen, their sewers, butlers, chamber-
lains, cooks, and bakers, each in his own frithborg. They
arc also to have their own esquires, or other servants, each in
his own frithborg. And if these persons shall commit an
offence against any man, and a charge shall be made by the
neighbours against them, they are to compel them to make
redress in their own courts ; that is to say, those who have the
right of sac, and soc, and thol, and them, and infangthefe.

" Sac, is when any person charges another by name with any
offence and he denies it ; on which the fine levied on proof or
disproof thereof, if there is one, belongs to the lord.

" Soc, is when any person searches for anything on his lands,
in which case, even though it be stolen it belongs to him,
\vhcther found or not.

" Thol, which we call ' Tholonium,' is the privilege of him
who has the right of buying and selling on his own lands.

" Them, is where any person lays claim to property in the
hands of another, in which case the party so challenged shall
produce his warranty, 9 - and if not, he shall be fined, and the
penalty shall go to the lord ; and similar justice shall be dealt
to him who makes the charge, if he shall fail in his proof.
The seller.

"That person has the right of ' infangthefe,' who has the
right of taking cognizance of robbery in his own court in the
case of his own homager, if such person shall have been taken
on his lands. But those who have not those customs, are to
have justice done before the king's justice in the hundreds
and wapentakes, or in the shires.

Of entertaining guests.

" If any person shall entertain a friend or a stranger, which
in English is called ' cuth other uncuth,' 93 he shall be at
liberty to keep him for two nights as a guest ; and if he shall
be guilty of an offence, the host shall not incur a penalty for
the guest. But if any injury shall be committed on any person,
and such person shall make a charge before a court of justice
against him that by his counsel the offence was committed, then,
together with two of his neighbours, lawful men, he shall clear
himself by oath of either counselling or abetting the same.
And if he shall not do so, he shall make good the loss and
pay a penalty. But if he shall be entertained a third night,
and shall commit an offence against any person, then the host
is to produce him to justice, as though one of his own household,
which in English is expressed by ' Twa night gest, thrid night
agen hine.' 94 And if in such case he shall not be able to produce
him to justice, then he shall have the space granted him of a
month and a day. And if the offender shall be found, he shall
make amends for the injury he has done, and shall make good
the same, even with his body, if that shall be adjudged against
him. But if the offender shall not be able to make good the
injury he has done, then his host shall make it good, and
shall pay a fine. And if the justice shall hold him suspected,
then he shall clear himself according to the judgment of the
court of the hundred or the shire.

What is to be done as to things found.

" If any person shall lead an animal into a vill, or shall bring
any money, and shall say that he has found the same, before he
takes it to his own house, or even that of any other person, he is to
take.it in front of the church, and in presence of the priest of the

93 " Kith or unkith ;" " acquainted or unacquainted."

church, and of the reeve and chief men of the vill, show all that
he has found, whatever it may be. The reeve of the vill is at
once to send to the three or four nearest vills for their priests
and reeves, who are also to bring with them three or four of
the principal men of each vill, and in the presence of them
all, the whole of what has been found is to be shown. After
this, in the sight of these persons, the reeve, to whose jurisdic-
tion the finder belongs, is to place the same in safe keeping until
the next day. On the following day, he is to go with some of
his neighbours who have seen what has been found to the bailiff
of the hundred in which his vill- is situate, and show him
the whole thereof. And if he is the homager of the lord on
whose lands the same has been found, and the lord, in whose
hands it has been found, has not his customs of sac or soc,
he is to deliver the whole thereof to the bailiff of the hundred, in
the presence of good witnesses, if he chooses to take it. But if
the lord has such customs, then justice is to be done in the lord's
court.

Of Jews established in the kingdom.

" Be it also known, that all Jews, wheresoever they are in the
kingdom, are to be under the tutelage and lawful protection of
the king ; and no one of them can serve under any rich man
without the king's leave ; for the Jews and all their property
belong to the king. And if any person shall lay hands on
them or their money, the king is to demand restitution thereof,
if he so pleases, as of his own.

Of those who have protection by the king's Letters.
" Those who have the king's protection, either under his
hand or by his letters, must observe their fealty to him. There-
fore it is their bounden duty to observe the same inviolably to-
w*ds all men, and not, having gained the shelter of his pro-
tection, to withhold rights or services from their superior lords,
nor yet from their neighbours ; for he is not worthy to enjoy
peace who is not ready to keep it towards others. And if any
person should rely too much on the protection which he enjoys,
and shall be guilty of an injury to another, then he is to make
good the loss, and to pay a fine of the same amount. The former
the English call ' murdre,' 95 and the fine ' astrihilthet.' 96

What those a/re to pay to ike king and the dean who infringe upon
the king's protection.

" Protection given under the king's hand, that given on the
first eight days from the time of his coronation, protection on the
before-named festivals, and protection by the king's letters, have
one mode of redress [for breach thereof], which is to be taken
cognizance of in the highest court of justice, held in the shire
in which the peace has been broken, as for example, in places
subject to the Danish law, 95 the eighteen hundreds pay the
penalty, the amount of which is one hundred and forty-four
pounds ; as the Danes assessed the penalty paid by each hun-
dred 96 at eight pounds Norwegian, and eight multiplied by
eighteen makes one hundred and forty -four. And this, not
without a reason. 97 For of these eight pounds the king had
one hundred shillings, and the earl of the county, who had
every third penny of fines, fifty shillings. The dean of the
bishop, in whose deanery the peace had been broken, had the
remaining ten, besides the king's protection, if the protection
had been originally granted under the king's hand, or on his
coronation, or on the festivals before-mentioned of the Na-
tivity, Easter, or Pentecost.



Of the supervision of those who disregarded tJiese laws.

" As it happened that some foolish and dishonest people,
without reason, and too frequently, did injuries to their neigh-
bours, the wiser persons began to take cognizance of the matter,
and appointed j ustices over every ten frithborgs, whom we may call
' deciners.' These, in.English, were called ' tienheofod,' that is,
' heads of ten.' They took cognizance of matters between the
vills and their neighbours, exacted fines for offences com-
mitted, and made parties come to terms, about such things as
pasturage, meadows, harvests, disputes between neighbours,
and innumerable questions of that nature, which harass human
frailty, and are everlastingly attacking it. When, however,
greater matters of dispute arose, they referred them to their
superior judges, whom the wise men before-mentioned had ap-
pointed over them, that is to say, over the ten deciners, and

95 Denelega. M On this contribution to the penalty by sections

whom we may call 'centurions' or 'centeners,' because they ex-
ercised jurisdiction over a hundred frithborgs.

Of Wapentage, and how those acted who accepted Wapentage.

"Warwickshire, Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire, Leicester-
shire, and Northamptonshire, as far as "Watling Street extends
and eight miles beyond, are under the law of the English. And
what the English call a ' Hundred,' the counties above-named
call a 'Wapentake.' And not without a reason ; for when a per-
son received the headship of a wapentake, on a day named, at
the place where they were accustomed to meet, all the elders
went forth to meet him, and, on his dismounting from his horse,
they all closed around him ; on which, raising his spear erect, in
the usual manner, he received the assurance of all. Then all,
as many as had come, with their lances touched his spear, and
thus by touching arms gave assurance, publicly granting him
their protection. Now, in the English language, arms are called
' wsepnu,' and 'taccare' means 'to assure,' and the phrase, as it
were, means ' the assurance of arms ;' or, if we may more ex-
plicitly explain the word ' wapentake,' in the English lan-
guage it means, 'the touching of arms,' for 'waepnu' means
'arms,' and 'tac' is 'touch.' Therefore, we may conclude
that for this reason all such assemblage was called a wapentake;
it being the fact that by touching arms they were leagued
together.

What the difference is between a Wapentake, a Trihing, and
a Hundred.

" There were also other jurisdictions, above the wapentake,
which were called ' Trihingas, ' because they consisted of the third
part of a county. Those who truled the trihings were called
' Triliingerefas ; ' and before them were brought the causes of
the trihing which could not be settled in the wapentakes,
and thus, what the English called by the name of hundreds ;
they called ' wapentakes ; ' and what the people of England
called, 'three' or 'four hundreds,' these people called 'trihinga.'
In some counties, in the English language, what they called
' trihinga,' was called ' lethe.' 99 Causes that could not be
settled in the trihing were taken to the shire.

What is the meaning of the name ' Greve,' and ichat are his du-
ties ; and what is the meaning of the name Ealdorman, which
literally signifies an elder of the people ; and into how many
meanings the name ' Greve' has been expanded.

"Greve 1 also is a name that signifies power, and cannot be
better expressed in Latin than by the word ' praefectura,' for the
word is employed with such multiplied meanings, that there is
the ' greve ' of the shire, of wapen takes, hundreds (also of the
'lethe'), boroughs, and of vills even; in all of which it seems
to have the same meaning, and to signify the same as ' domi-
nus' [chief]. Some, also, are of opinion that the word 'greve'
is a name compounded of the English 'grith' and the Latin
'vse.' For 'grith' is a word denoting peace, whereas 'vae'*
indicates misery : as the Lord testifies when He says, ' Va3*
unto thee, Chorazin.' Consequently the greve is so called, be-
cause by law he ought to ensure to the country ' grith,' or peace,
against those who would bring upon it ' vas,' that is, evil or
misery. The Germans, and Frisians, and Flemings, are in the
habit of calling their earls by the name of ' margrave,' as though
meaning 'higher lords,' or 'good peacemakers.' And those
who are called ' greves' at the present day, having jurisdiction
over others among the English, were anciently called ' ealdor-
men,' as though elders, not by reason of old age, inasmuch as
some were young men, but on account of their wisdom.

For what reason Icing William abolished the laws of the English
and retained those of the Danes.

" The law of the Danes and Norwegians prevailed in Nor-
folk, Suifolk, and Cambridgeshire. Now as to payment of
penalties [by hundreds] for offences committed, where these
counties had eighteen hundreds, the former ones 3 had only ten
and a half, which arose from their being in the vicinity of the
Saxons, 1 the whole sum of contribution in cases of the largest
penalty among the Saxons in those times being eighty-four*
pounds. But in all other matter for trial and penalties they
had the same law with the [Danes and] Norwegians above-

named. 5 *[When king William heard of this, together with
the other laws of his kingdom, he greatly approved thereof,
and gave orders that it should be observed throughout all his
kingdom. For he stated that his ancestors, and those of
nearly all the barons of Normandy, had been Norwegians, and
had formerly come from Norway. And for this reason he
asserted that he ought to follow and observe their laws before
the other laws of his kingdom, as being more profound and
more consistent with what was right : whereas the laws of
other nations, Britons, Angles, Picts, and Scots, were prevail-
ing in every quarter. On hearing of this, the whole of the
people of this country who had promulgated these laws, being
touched with sorrow, entreated him with one accord that he
would allow them to retain their own laws and ancient customs,
under which their fathers had lived, and they themselves were
born and brought up, as it would be very hard for them to re-
ceive laws of which they knew nothing, and judge on matters of
which they were ignorant. The king, however, still remaining
obdurate, they at last plied him with entreaties, for the sake of
the soul of king Edward, who had granted him the crown and
kingdom in succession to himself, and by whom and no strangers
the said laws were founded, not to compel them to observe
j other than the laws of their fathers. After taking this under
I due consideration, at the earnest request of his barons, he at
length acceded to their entreaties. From that day, therefore,
I their authority being recognized, the laws of Saint Edward the
I king were respected throughout all the kingdom, and were con-
firmed and observed before all other laws of the country, hav-
ing been first established and enacted in the days of king
Edgar, his grandfather ; but, after his death, they had been
I seaside for sixty-eight years. For Edward, his son and heir
I by his lawful wife, reigned four years, less sixteen weeks;
i after whose death, in his innocence, by the treachery of his
| stepmother, on account of his innocent life, so chaste and so
full of alms-deeds, and his undeserved end, they honored him
as a Martyr, and held him to be a Saint. After him, his brother
Aldred 6 received the kingdom, and ruled, amid many adver-
, eities and perils, eight- and-thirty years. After Aldred, his
I son Edmund Ironside reigned nearly nine months, during which

J * This appears to be a gloss or interpolation.

i elred."



558 AXXALS OP EOGEE DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1180.

he valiantly fought five battles against Canute, the king of the
Danes. After the last battle, they came to terms, and divided
the kingdom in halves; and one moiety of England fell to
Canute, the other to Edmund, on condition that whoever
should survive the other should have the whole of the king-
dom, and that neither should in the meanwhile be crowned.
Matters, therefore, being thus settled, and all the chief men
of England giving their assent to the arrangement thus made
between them, within one month after, Edward was, alas !
removed from this world ; on which Canute received the king-
dom of the whole of England, and ruled nearly eighteen years.
After his decease, Harold Harefoot, supposed by nearly all to
be falsely considered as the son of Canute and Elfgiva, succeeded
to the throne, and reigned five years ; after whom Hardicanute,
son of Canute and Emma, the sister of Robert, duke of Nor-
mandy, and mother of the last king, Saint Edward, reigned
two years, less twelve weeks. And thus passed sixty-eight
years, during which the said laws were neglected. But after
king E.dward came to the throne, by the advice of the barons
of England, he raised the code of laws that had slept for sixty,
eight years, and remodelled it thus raised, beautified it thus
remodelled, and confirmed it thus beautified. When thus
confirmed, it was called 'the law of king Edward,' 6 * not because
he had been the first to frame it, but because it had been
neglected and almost left in oblivion from the days of his
grandfather, Edgar, who had reigned seventeen years, and who
had been the first founder thereof, until his own times, being
nearly, as said above, sixty-eight years. For Edward, because
it was a just and good code of laws, raised it from the deep
abyss, and matured it and ordered it to be observed as though
his own.

" Edmund Ironside before-named had a son, Edward by
name, who, shortly after the death of his father, through fear
of king Canute, fled to the king of the Rugi, which we more pro-
perly call Russia ; and the king of that country, Malesclotus by
name, when he understood who he was, gave him an honorable re-
ception. He there married a wife of noble birth, by whom he
had Edgar Atheling, Margaret, afterwards queen of Scotland,
and Christiana, her sister, to which Christiana king Edward
gave the lands afterwards held by Ralph de Limisey. Now,
the said Christiana was sister of Edgar Atheling, who was sent
** See the note in page 545.

for by his uncle king Edward, who caused him to come to
his court ; on arriving at which he did not long survive, and
in a very short space of time his wife died. King Edward,
however, kept his son Edgar with him, and brought him up
as his own son. And because he intended to make him his
heir be gave him the name of ' Atheling,' the same as we say
' domicellus' or ' damisell,' meaning ' young lord ; ' but we say
it indifferently of many, inasmuch as we 7 call the sons of
barons ' damisells,' whereas the English called none but the sons
of kings by that name. And if we would express this still
more clearly, in one part of Saxony" an image is known by the
name of ' ling ;' and ' athel,' in the English, signifies noble ;
wherefore, the two being joined together, the word ' Atheling'
would signify the ' image of nobility.' Hence it is that the
West-Saxons, that is, the people of Exeter, have an expres-
sion signifying supreme contempt 'hinderling,' meaning ' an
image cast down from or forsaking all propriety.' King Ed-
ward, however, as he was aware of the wickedness of his
nation, and especially the vanity of the sons of Godwin, namely,
Harold (who afterwards seized the kingdom), Gurth, Leofwin,
and the rest of his brothers, thinking that that could not
possibly be lasting or durable which he had purposed respecting
Edgar Atheling, adopted William, duke of the Normans, as
his successor in the kingdom, William the Bastard, that is
to say, the bastard son of Robert, his mother's brother and
his own uncle, a valiant, brave, and warlike man, who after-
wards, by the will of God, having conquered the above-named
Harold, the son of Godwin, victoriously gained possession of
the kingdom of the English.]

Of robbers slain for robbery.

**If, after judgment given, any one shall make a charge
fore the justiciary that a person has been unrighteously slain,
and that unjustly he lies buried among robbers, and shall say
I that he is willing'to make proof thereof, he is to give a pledge
land find sureties ; upon which, the space of one month and a day
shall be given him, and then he is to take relatives of the per-
son slain, on both sides, namely, his father's and his mother's
side, twelve on his father's side and six on his mother's. And
I if these eighteen are willing to make proof with him who first
(made the charge, and who has given the pledge, each of them

is to give his pledge with his sword ; and, after that, he is to
find sureties, such as can pay his fine, that is to say, his ' were/
in case they cannot make proof of what they say. Then
the slayer is to give his pledge and find sureties that the person
was rightfully slain, and deservedly lies buried among robbers, 7
and according to law, as being a robber. And then, he is
first, to show for what robbery and for what reason he was
slain. And if he shall acknowledge that he was taken alive,
he is to name a court, and judges, and lawful witnesses of the
number of his neighbours. And if these persons shall un-
dertake to prove that justice was rightfully done upon the per-
son as his theft deserved, then his slayer shall be acquitted.
In such case they who have made the charge shall forfeit
their securities, the same to be paid over to the judges and
witnesses. And if it shall be proved that he was unjustly
slain, then the slayer shall give pledge to the justice of the
bishop, and sureties that he will make redress. After this,
the justice of the bishop shall cause a procession to be formed,
with the priest clad in alb, maniple, and stole, and the clerks
in their surplices with holy water and cross, with candle-
sticks going before, and thurible, fire, and incense. And then,
his friends are to bring him forth, and place the dead man on
a bier and carry him to the church ; where the mass having
been performed for the dead and the other offices performed,
they shall inter him as becomes a Christian. Between that
day and sixteen days therefrom, the slayer is to pay three
fines to the bishop : one, because he has slain a lawful man
as a robber ; another, 'because he has buried his brother as a
robber ; which the English call ' his emne-Christen ;' 8 and the
third because he has given security that he would make proof
and has not been able so to do.

Of Usurers.

" King Edward also forbade usurers to remain in his king-
dom ; and if any person was convicted of exacting usurious in-
terest, he was to lose all his substance, and be thenceforth
considered out of the pale of the law. Por this king used to
assert, that he had heard it remarked, at the court of the king
of the Franks, while he was staying there, that usury is the
root of all vices.

Of purchases.

" By the same law it was also forbidden, that any person
should buy a live animal or worn garment without sureties and
good witnesses. If it was a work of gold or silver, concerning
which the buyer might be in doubt, he was not to buy it
without the aid of goldsmiths or moneyers. If these, on seeing
it, said that it came out of a church or treasury, he was not
to buy it without finding sureties ; and if the seller could not
find sureties, then he was to be detained with the property
until his lord should come, or some one else who could give
good security for him ; and if any man bought on any other
terms, because he had purchased foolishly, he was at once to
lose what he had bought and pay a fine. After this, inquisi-
tion was to be made by legal men, 8 and the chief men of the
borough, or vill, or hundred where the buyer lived, as to what
(was his mode of life, and if they had ever heard of his being
bharged with acting unlawfully : and if witness was borne by
fchem, that he was of good life and lawful character, he was to
jprove before the court of the county that he did not know that
(the seller was acting unlawfully in the sale thereof, or was guilty
fof any unlawful offence, and if he should know who the seller
hvas or where he was, he was to say so ; on which the .jus-
ticiary was to make search for him, in order to bring him to
(justice, and if he could not be found he was to be outlawed.

Of buyers and provision dealers.

" But when it was stated that no man was to buy a live
animal without sureties, the provision-sellers in the cities and
iboroughs, whom the English call ' fishmongers,' made an out-
cry, that every day they were obliged to buy, kill, and sell
jlive animals, as their livelihood was got by killing such
|anials. In addition to which, the citizens, burgesses, and
[populace cried out for their customs, because they had about
[the feast of Saint Martin been in the habit of buying animals
at market without any surety, for the purpose of killing them
^against the Nativity of our Lord. There was also a great mur-
muring among the multitude about this enactment. Wherefore
I am of opinion, that if enquiry had been made whether that
l-decree pleased or not, as is the case in some assemblages, an
; answer would with universal assent have been given by multi-
1 tudes, ' it does not BO please us.' There, also, you might have
8 Lagamannos.

heard, had you been present, different whispers muttered aside
in the ear, and the clamours and murmurs of a tumultuous po-
pulace. It was to the king's praise, however, that he would
not do away with customs that were just and wisely framed';
but he only required in the king's market, on the sale of their
wares, that there should be witnesses and some knowledge of
the parties selling."

The Genealogy of the Dukes of Normandy.

Hollo, the first duke of Normandy, who at his baptism was also
named Robert, reigned thirty years ; his son William, twenty-
five, Richard the Elder, fifty-three, Richard the Second, thirty,
Richard the Third, one year, Robert, his brother, eight years ;
William the Bastard reigned as duke thirty years, and after
he was king of the English, twenty years. Now Richard the
Elder had a daughter named Emma, who was married to
Adelred, 9 king of the English, and by whom that king became
the father of Edward and Alfred. In the time of Richard
the Second, king Adelred caused the Danes throughout England
to be slain, in consequence of which Sweyn, king of the Danes,
invaded England and subdued it ; on which, Adelred, with his
wife and sons, fled to Normandy, to the court of Richard the
Second, the brother of his wife, and duke of Normandy.
Shortly after this, Sweyn died, and was carried to Denmark to
be buried there.

In the mean time, Adelred, with his wife, returned to his
kingdom, leaving his sons in the charge of their uncle. After
Sweyn was buried, his son Canute, with a great fleet, bringing
with him Lachiman, the king of the Swedes, and Olaf, the
king of the Norwegians, who was afterwards baptized at Rouen,
entered the Thames, and besieged king Adelred in London ; who,
while thus besieged, was suddenly attacked by a malady, and
died. Canute, on gaining possession of the kingdom, took the
before -named queen Emma to wife, and by her became the
father of Hardicanute, who was afterwards king of the Danes,
and of a daughter named Gunhilda, who became the wife of
Henry, emperor of the Romans. In the meantime, on the de-
cease of Richard the Second, his son Richard succeeded him for
a single year ; after whose death his son 10 Robert succeeded him.
He, being wishful- to replace Edward on the throne of the
English, gave him a fleet, but being forced to return in conse-
quence of contrary winds, after having been detained a long

time at the isle of Gerneswic, 11 returned to Normandy. After
this, setting out for Jerusalem, he left his son "William, then a
little child, his heir ; and having fulfilled his vow, in return-
ing to his country, died at the city of Nicaea.

At the time of William succeeding to the dukedom of Nor-
mandy, Canute, king of the English, departed this life, and
was succeeded by Harold Harefoot, his son hy his concubine
Elgiva. Edward, feeling indignant at this, setting sail with
forty ships, landed at Hampton, 12 where the English showing
resistance, after taking considerable booty, he returned to Nor-
mandy. In the meantime, however, his brother Alfred, who,
with a large body of troops, had made an attempt upon another
part, being received by earl Godwin with an appearance of
hospitality, was by stratagem taken by him at night together
with his followers ; and being placed in chains and brought
before king Harold, together with his companions, was deprived
of his eyes, the rest being put to death.

Not long after this, Harold Harefoot also died, and Hardica-
nute, returning from Denmark, succeeded him, being the son
of Emma, the mother of Edward. On this, Hardicanute sent
for his elder brother Edward from Normandy, and made him
five with him, and on his death,two years after, Edward suc-
ceeded him as his heir. The good king Edward reigned
twenty-two years, but having no issue, sent to his kinsman,
William, duke of the Normans, Robert, the archbishop of Can-
terbury, and made him the heir to his kingdom : after him
he also sent earl Harold, who swore fealty to William at
Rouen. But, after the death of Edward, Harold treacherously
and rebelliously took possession of the kingdom and reigned nine
months, and together with his powerful accomplices, seducers,
ant associates, unjustly, iniquitously, and seditiously deprived
the lawful heir of the good king Edward of the crown of the
whole of the said kingdom ; 13 on hearing of which, William
setting sail with a powerful fleet, landed at Pevensey, and after
building a fortress there, erected another at Hastings. Harold,
meeting him with the English, fought a battle at about the third
hour of the day on the second day before the Ides of October, in
which Harold" was slain at the first onset ; the fight, how-
ever, having been prolonged until nightfall. William being vic-
torious, was, on the following feast of the Nativity of our Lord,

in the year of the Incarnation of our Lord one thousand six
hundred and sixty-six, crowned at London, king of the English.

He reigned over England twenty-two years, and after his
death his son William reigned thirteen years ; in the ninth
year of whose reign a pilgrimage 14 of the nations to Jerusalem
against the Saracens took place. In the fourth year of this "
expedition, Jerusalem was taken by the Franks, and Godfrey,
duke of Lorraine, reigned over it, though for one year only ; and ,
was succeeded by his brother Baldwin, who reigned eighteen
years. "King William was slain with an arrow while hunting -
in England, in the thirteenth year of his reign ; on which he
was succeeded by his brother Henry, who reigned thirty- six
years. He was a feeder of wild beasts, 15 and a guardian of the
forests, and has been styled by Merlinus Ambrosius, 16 in his
" History of the Kings," " the lion of justice ;" for he exi '
ercised justice and judgment in the land.

He was succeeded by Stephen, his nephew, who reigned -
nineteen years ; after whose death Henry, the son of Geoffrey, ;
earl of Anjou, and of Matilda, the former empress of the 1
Romans, and daughter of the before-named king Henry the ;
First, took the helm of the kingdom of England, and reigned S
thirty-five years. He dying, and being buried at the abbey of '
the nuns at Fontevraud, his son Richard succeeded him in the i
government of the kingdom, and after having reigned nine ^
years, seven months, and, twenty days, being struck by an (
arrow at the siege of the castle of Chaluz, departed this life on '
the eighth day before the ides of April. His entrails were in- 5
terred at Chinon, his heart at Rouen, and his body at Fonte- i
vraud. After his decease his brother John succeeded to the ,
throne, and reigned over the kingdom of England. 17

THE ANNALS



OF



ROGER DE HOVEDEN.

THE SECOND PAET CONTINUED.



IN the year of grace 1181, being the twenty-seventh year of the
reign of king Henry, son of the empress Matilda, the said king
was at Le Mans, on the day of the Nativity of our Lord. After
this festival, he enacted throughout all his territories, heyond
sea, that every man who had a hundred pounds of money An-
jouin, in chattel property, should keep a horse and a complete
set of military accoutrements ; that every man who had chattel
property to the amount of forty, thirty, or twenty-five pounds
Anjouin, at the least should have a hauberk, an iron head-piece,
a lance and a sword ; while all other persons were to have a
gambeson, 1 an iron head-piece, a lance and a sword, or a bow
and arrows ; and he forbade any person to sell or pledge his
arms ; but on his death he was to leave the same to his next
heir. When Philip, king of France, and Philip, earl of Flan-
ders, came to hear of this, they ordered that their men should
arm themselves in a similar manner.

In the same year, after the Purification of Saint Mary, Lau-
rence, archbishop of Dublin, came into Normandy, bringing
with him the son of Roderic, king of Connaught, and delivered
him to the king of England as a hostage for the performance of
the treaty made between him and the king of Connaught, as to the
payment of tribute by Ireland ; shortly after which the said
archbishop of Dublin died at Auc, in Normandy, and was buried
there. After his decease, the king of England sent to Ireland

1 The gambeson, or wambais, or subarmale, was made of quilted stuff,
and formed the body armour of the burgesses.

Geoffrey de Haye, his own secretary, and the secretary of
Alexis, the legate in Ireland, to take possession of the arch-
bishopric of Dublin, and also sent with them John, the constable
of Chester, and Richard of the Peak, to take charge of the city
of Dublin, of which Hugh de Lacy had had the keeping.
For our lord the king was unwilling that he should any longer
have charge of it, because he had, without his permission, mar-
ried the daughter of the king of Connaught, according to the
usage of that country.

In the same year, our lord the pope most strictly commanded
Richard, the archbishop of Canterbury, all pretexts and excuses
laid aside, under pain of ecclesiastical censure, to compel Geof-
frey, the bishop elect of the church of Lincoln, and son 2 of our
lord the king of England, either to renounce his election, or
without delay to take priest's orders, and assume the dignity of
the pontifical office. On this, Geoffrey being placed in a di-
lemma, sensible of his own insufficiency, and considering that
he was not competent to perform the duties of so arduous an
office, preferred to renounce the episcopal office, rather than
undertake to bear a burden which he could not support. Ac-
cordingly, he wrote to Richard, the archbishop of Canterbury,
to the following effect.

Tlw Letter of Geoffrey, bishop of Lincoln elect, on his resignation
of that bishopric.

1 ' To the venerable father and lord Richard, by the grace of God,
archbishop of Canterbury, and legate of the Apostolic See, Geof-
frey, son and chancellor of our lord the king of England, health
and all due and duteous respect. It has pleased his Apostolic
Majesty to instruct your holiness to call upon me within a cer-
tain time to take priest's orders and to assume the dignity of the
pontifical office. Now upon considering how many bishops of
more mature years, and more advanced in wisdom, are still
hardly of an age to prove themselves equal to the requirements
of such a weighty office, and are scarcely able to fulfil the duties
of their pontificate without danger to souls, I have been alarmed
at myself, who am so much younger, assuming a burden, which
those more advanced in years are unable to bear, not doing so
from any levity of feeling, but from a feeling of respect for my
vows. Having therefore had an interview hereon, with our
lord the king, my father, and my lords and brothers the king
2 Illegitimate son. He was Afterwards archbishop of York.



A.D. 1181. LETTER OF POPE ALEXANDER. 3

and the earls of Poitou and Brittany, and Henry, bishop of
Bayeux, Eroger, bishop of Seez, Keginald, bishop of Bath,
Sigfred, bishop of Chichester, who were present, I have come
to a different determination as to my mode of life and profession,
wishing for a time to serve in a military capacity under the
orders of the king, my father, and to refrain from interfering
in episcopal matters. Accordingly, most holy father, I do
spontaneously, freely, and entirely, resign into your hands all
rights consequent upon my election, as also the see of Lincoln ;
requesting of you as being my metropolitan, and for this pur-
pose especially delegated by the Apostolic See, absolution both
from the said election and from holding the said bishopric.
Farewell."

In like manner, the said bishop elect of Lincoln wrote to
the canons of the church of Lincoln, asking of them absolu-
tion both from the said election and from holding the said
bishopric. After this, our lord, the king, by whose advice his
son Geoffrey had resigned his election into the hands of the arch-
bishop of Canterbury, gave him his chancellorship and a yearly
revenue of five hundred marks in England, and the same in
Normandy.

In this year, Saladin, the king of Babylon, seeing that Bald-
win, king of Jerusalem, being smitten with leprosy, had not
strength to resist him, raising a great force, came into the land
of Jerusalem, and laid it waste, and there was no person to make
any resistance to him. In the same year, the king of England
was at Chinon during the festival of Easter ; and after Easter
returned into Normandy, and held a conference with Philip, king
of Prance, at Ve Saint llemy, on the fifth day before the calends
of May, being the second day of the week ; at which the Tem-
plars and Hospitallers of Jerusalem presented to the before-
named Idngs letters from Alexander, the Supreme Pontiff, to
the following effect :

The Letter of pope Alexander on the necessity of giving aid to the
land of Jerusalem.

" Alexander, the bishop, servant of the servants of God, to
his dearly beloved sons, those noble men, the dukes and princes,
earls, barons, and all the faithful servants of God, to whom
these letters shall come, health and the Apostolic benediction.
The sinister rumours which, according to the universal report
of those passing this way, have reached us from the land of

B 2



ANNALS OF BOGER DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1181.

Jerusalem, have afflicted our heart and those of all our brethren
with excessive grief ; inasmuch as any one who has the name
of Christian can hardly even hear, without tears and sighs, the
recitals that are given as to the wretched state of that country.
For it is (and with grief we own it) trodden down under the
inroads of the infidels, and so utterly bereft of the prowess of men
of might, and the prudent counsel of men of probity, that un-
less the people receive from the Christian kings and princes of
the earth speedy and powerful succour, we fear, which may
God forbid, the speedy desolation thereof, thus working to
the disgrace of the Lord, and to the contempt of the Christian
faith. For there is no king to rule that land, inasmuch as Bald-
win, who now holds the helm of state, has been (as we believe
you are aware) so grievously scourged under the righteous
judgments of God, that he is hardly able to endure the inces-
sant torments of his body. Indeed, the heavy losses and the
shocking misfortunes, both in men and property, which that
land (for which our fathers and ancestors shed their blood in the
battles which they formerly waged with the heathens) has, in
consequence of its sins so requiring it, endured, we can neither
without great sorrowing at heart call to our recollection, nor
can any who are zealous for the law of the Lord, endure with
feelings of patience calamities of the faithful so mighty ; and
the more especially so, as this most abominable nation of the
pagans, in consequence of the losses and dangers which they
have inflicted upon the nation of the Christians, are said to be
inspired with such audacity as impudently to boast that they
will, which God forbid, gain possession of that land. There-
fore let the zeal of the Lord move you, and let not the Christian
religion sleep in its sorrow over such mighty evils as are threat-
ening that land ; but, on the contrary, manfully defend all those
places which our Saviour and Redeemer has sanctified by His
bodily presence, and despise the nations which reject the Lord,
and strive to sweep away the Christian name from off the earth.
For indeed, there is no Christian who is not moved at the mis-
fortunes of the before-named land, and who does not prepare for
the purpose of defending it from the attacks of the infidels,
while they are striving to possess it, and, which God forbid,
to profane it by their abominations. Therefore, those among
you who are valiant and fit for waging war, ought, as a matter of
duty, to undertake a work as pious as it is necessary and the la-
bours of this pilgrimage, clothed no less with the shield of faith



A. D. 1181. LETTEK OF POPE ALEXANDEB. 5

and the breastplate of justice than with worldly arms, and
to defend those places in which the Eedeemer of mankind has
been willing to die for us and has undergone a temporal death,
with powerful might, so that in our times Christianity may
suffer no detriment in those parts. For inasmuch as Christ for
our salvation endured many insults, and, last of all, suspension
on the cross, that He might make an offering of us to God,
mortified in the flesh and justified in the spirit, it is most
conducive to the salvation of the faithful that on His behalf
we should expose our bodies to perils and to labours, that so
we may not seem to be forgetful of the price of His blood
which He shed for us. Give heed therefore, my beloved sons
in Christ, and consider how disgraceful it would be, and how
deserving of the grief of all Christians, if at last the enemies
of the cross of Christ should prevail against the dwellers in
that land ; and that they will prevail we have no small dread,
unless assistance is brought in all haste from the different parts
of Christendom to those who dwell there. Therefore, take
precaution and exert all your endeavours that Christianity
may not succumb to heathenism, inasmuch as it is better to
meet an impending evil before it comes, than to seek a remedy
after the cause has been injured. To those also, who in behalf
of Christ shall undertake the labours of this expedition, we
do, by the Apostolic authority, grant and confirm that re-
mission of sins, which the fathers, our predecessors, Urban
and Eugenius, the Eoman Pontiffs, gave by their enactments.
The wives also, and children of such persons, and their goods
and possessions, we do decree, to be under the protection of
Saint Peter and of ourselves, as also of the archbishops and
bishops and other prelates of the Church ; strictly forbidding,
that after the assumption of the cross, any claim shall be
entertained with reference to the things of which they are in
peaceable possession, until such time as they shall return, or
certain information shall have been brought of their death. Let
it also be lawful for them, after their relations, or even their
superior lords, to whom the fee belongs, have shown them-
selves unwilling or unable to lend them money thereon, to
pledge their lands or other possessions to churches or to eccle-
siastics or others of the faithful, freely and without any challenge
thereof, in order to defray the expenses of the said expedition.
Moreover, such men, accustomed to arms and fitted for the de-
fence of that land, as shall, in the fervour of their devotion,



6 ANNALS OF EOGEB DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1181.

repair to those holy places, and serve there for a period of two
years against the Saracens, in defence of the Christian name,
trusting in the merits of Jesus Christ and in the authority
of the Apostles Saint Peter and Saint Paul, we do give them
absolution for all those sins of which with a contrite and hum-
ble heart they shall make confession, unless they shall happen to
have taken property that belongs to another, or to have extorted
usurious interest, or to have committed thefts ; for all which
Offences due reparation ought to be made. But if those who
are guilty thereof have not the means of making such repara-
tion, nevertheless they shall obtain pardon for their offences,
as we have already mentioned. And those who shall have re-
mained there but one year, as we have previously mentioned,
shall obtain an indulgence for one half the penance enjoined
them and remission of their sins. And, further, to all, who, by
reason of urgent necessity, are wishful to visit the sepulchre of
our Lord, whether they die on the road, or whether they arrive
at that place, we do enjoin that the labour of the said journey
shall be in place of penance, and obedience, and for the remission
of all their sins, that so by the bounty of God, they may arrive
from the turmoils of this life at that state of blessedness,
1 Which eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither hath en-
tered into the heart of man/ 15 and which the Lord hath promised
to those who love Him. Given at Tusculanum, on the seven-
teenth day before the calends of February."

The said pope also wrote to the archbishops, bishops, and
other prelates of churches with reference to the same subject,
to the following effect :

Another Letter of pope Alexander on the same subject.

" Alexander the bishop, servant of the servants of God, to
his venerable brethren the archbishops and bishops, and to his
dearly beloved sons the abbats and other prelates of churches
to whom these letters shall come, health and the Apostolic
benediction. Inasmuch as the eastern lands, by reason of
the attacks and assaults of the infidels, have been deprived of
the prowess of men of valour and the counsel of men of pro-
bity, and are stricken with exceeding dismay, the archbishops,
bishops, and other chief men of the land, have thought proper
to send to your parts our dearly beloved sons, the knights of the
Temple, the bearers of these presents, religious men, and who
15 1 Cor. ii. 9.



A.D. 1181. LETTEB OF POPE ALEXANDEE. 4

fear God, in order to implore your aid ; wherefore we, whom
the calamities of that land afflict with intense sorrow, after the
example of our fathers and predecessors, being anxious for the
preservation thereof, do by this healthful warning exhort the
Christian kings and princes of the world to the defence of
those places in which the feet of the Lord have stood ; and for
that purpose, we do proclaim to all sinners, who, in the cause
of Christ, shall undertake the labour of aiding Jerusalem, and
shall with faithful duteousness make it their care to fight against
the Saracens, that remission and forgiveness of sins, which
the fathers, our predecessors, Urban and Eugenius, the Roman
Pontiffs, gave by their enactments. We do therefore advise
and strictly enjoin the whole of you, to receive with kindly
feelings the brethren who have been sent for this purpose, and
after learning through them the state of the countries of the
east, and the necessities thereof, to labour by frequent and
anxious exhortations to induce the princes, earls, and others
of the faithful in Christ in your respective dioceses, to repair
with all haste to these lands, for the delivery of which their
fathers and ancestors have shed their own blood, and to fight with
might and valour against the enemies of the cross of Christ.
The letters which for this purpose we send, addressed to all
generally, you will cause to be publicly read in all churches and
will explain the tenor thereof, and will announce the remission
of sins which we grant to those who shall engage in a work so
pious and so necessary, and so advise all persons to do that
which we suggest. And may, through your anxiety and your
exhortations, that land speedily be sensible of the aid and suc-
cour of the faithful, and may you yourselves in return for it,
gain from Almighty God an everlasting reward. Given at
Tusculanum, 16 on the sixteenth day of January."

On hearing of this, Philip, king of France, and Henry, king
of England, greatly lamenting the adversities and the de-
solation of the land of Jerusalem, promised that they would,
with the aid of the Lord, give speedy succour thereto ; upon
which, the interview was brought to a close.

In the meantime, William, king of Scotland, by the com-
mand of our lord the king of England, came into Normandy,
and by his counsel and advice the said king of Scotland gave
liberty to return to Matthew, bishop of Aberdeen, and John,
bishop of Saint Andrew's, whom he had banished from Soot-
16 The modern Frascati.

land. An agreement was entered into between them, in
presence of the king of England, to the following effect :
That Matthew, bishop of Aberdeen, should freely and without
any opposition, under the safe conduct of the king of Scotland,
return to his own see, and if anything should have been taken
from him, the same should be restored ; and John, who had
been consecrated bishop of Saint Andrew's, in order to regain
the favour of his lord the king of Scotland, agreed that he
would give up to him the said bishopric, if he should be allowed
to choose whatever bishopric he might please in the kingdom
of Scotland, and if in addition thereto, the king of Scotland
should give him his chancellorship and all the revenues which
he had held before his consecration, together with forty marks
of yearly revenue from the church of Saint Andrew's. Upon
this the king of Scotland sent his envoys to pope Alexander, to
request that for the sake of peace, he would allow this change
of episcopal sees to take place ; this, however, our lord, the
pope, would not allow.

After these transactions, the king of England gave to John
Fitz-Luke, his clerk, the bishopric of Exeter, and to Ralph de
"Warnville, who was his chancellor and treasurer of the church of
York, the bishopric of Lisieux, which Arnulph, bishop of Lisieux,
had vacated in consequence of the dislike which the king had
taken to him ; for when he found that he could at no price
obtain the royal favour, he preferred resigning the bishopric,
to enduring the king's hatred any longer. Accordingly, after
getting in his gold and silver from every quarter, of which he
was said to have a large quantity, and having received from
the king of England a large sum of money for vacating his
bishopric, he went to Paris, and remained at the church of
Saint Victor there until the day of his death. After this,
while the king of England was making a stay at Barbeflet, 17
with the intention of passing over to England, a dispute arose
between Philip, king of France, and Philip, earl of Flanders,
concerning the count of Claremont, whom the earl of Flanders
greatly disliked. The king of England, therefore, at the request
of the king of France, attended a conference between them at
Gisors, and made peace between the king of France and the
earl of Flanders. After this, the king of England came to
Cherbourg, and, passing over to England, landed at Ports-
mouth, on the seventh day before the calends of August, being
17 Harfleur.



A.n. 1181. ASSIZE AS TO KEEPING ARMS.

the Lord's day, with "William, king of the Scots, who accom-
panied him.

Shortly after this, the king of England made the follow-
ing assize as to keeping arms throughout England :

" Whoever has a single knight's fee must keep a cuirass, a
helmet, a shield, and a lance, and every knight must keep as
many cuirasses, helmets, shields, and lances as he has knights'
fees in his demesne. Every free layman, who shall have in
chattels or in rental to the amount of sixteen marks, must have
a hauberk, an iron head-piece, and a lance ; and all burgesses,
and all companies of freemen must keep a gambeson, an iron
head-piece, and a lance; and every person may make oath
that before the feast of Saint Hilary he will provide such arms,
and will do fealty to our lord the king, namely, Henry, the son
of the empress Matilda, and will hold the said arms at his ser-
vice in obedience to his command, and in fealty to his lord the
king and to his realm. And no person, after he shall have
provided the said arms, is to sell the same, or to make a pledge
thereof, or to lend them, or in any way to part with them ; nor
is the lord in any way to take them from his homager, either
by way of fine, gift, or pledge, or in any other way whatso-
ever. And if any person having the said arms shall die, his
arms shall remain with his heir ; and if his heir be not of
such an age that he can use arms, if required, then the person
who shall have the guardianship of him, shall in like manner
have the guardianship of such arms, and shall find a man to
use the said arms in the service of our lord the king, if
needs be, until the heir shall be of such an age as to be able to
bear arms, and then he is to have them. And further, what-
ever burgess shall have more arms than according to this assize
he ought to have, he is to sell the same, or give them away, or
part with them to some person who shall wield them in Eng-
land in the service of our lord the king. And no one of them
is to retain more arms than in conformity with this assize he
ought to have. Also, no Jew is to keep in his possession a
cuirass or hauberk ; but he is to sell the same or give them
away, or in some other manner dispose thereof, but so that they
continue to be used in the service of our lord the king of Eng-
land. Also, no person is to carry arms out of England except
with the leave of our lord the king, and no one is to sell arms
to any person for him to carry them out of England, and no
merchant or other person is to carry them out of England. Also,

the justices are to cause oath to be made by lawful knights, or
by other free and lawful men of hundreds, visnets, 18 and burghs,
as may seem most expedient to them, that those who have the
value in chattels to the amount above stated, shall provide, as
they ought, a cuirass, helmet, lance, and shield, according to
what has been mentioned above ; and that for the said purpose
they will name all those of their hundreds, visnets, and boroughs,
who have sixteen marks' value either in chattels or yearly ren-
tal ; and after that, the justices are to cause all of them to be
registered, both jurors and the others, both who they are
and what chattels or rental they have, and what arms each
ought to provide, according to the value of the chattels or
rental ; and after that, in their presence and in the hearing of
them all, they are to cause this assize to be read as to keeping
arms, and to cause them to make oath that they will provide
such arms according to the aforesaid value of the chattels or
rental, and will hold the same at the service of our lord the
king in conformity with the aforesaid assize, in obedience to
the command of and in fealty to their lord, king Henry, son of
the empress Matilda, and to his realm. And if it shall so
happen that any one of those persons who ought to provide
such arms shall not be in the county at the time when the jus-
tices shall be in that county, then the justices are to appoint a
time for him to appear before them in another county. And
if the said persons shall not come to them in any county
through which they shall pass, and shall not be in those dis-
tricts, then they are to name a time at Westminster, on the
octave of Saint Michael, that each may then be there for the
purpose of making oath, as he loves himself and all that belongs
to him ; and orders are to be given to him before the feast of
Saint Hilary before-named, to provide arms according as he
is bound to provide the same. And further, the justices are
to cause proclamation to be made throughout all counties
through which they shall pass, that those persons who shall
not provide the said arms as herein commanded, the king will
lay hands on their bodies, and will on no account take from
them their lands or chattels. Also, no person is to be sworn
as of the free and lawful men who has not sixteen marks or
ten marks in chattels. Also, the justices are to give orders
throughout all the counties through which they shall pass, that

is Neighbourhoods ;" from the Norman " vesine ;" probably, small
communities not unlike the " frith-borgs" of the Anglo-Saxons.



A.D. 1181. THE KING OF SCOTLAND EXCOMMUNICATED. 11

no person, 'as lie loves himself and all that belongs to him,
shall buy or sell any ship for the purpose of transport from
England ; and that no person shall carry timber, or cause it to
be carried, out of England. The king has also ordered that
no person shall be admitted to the oath of arms unless he is a
free man."

In the same year, Henry, king of England, son of the em-
press Matilda, gave to John Cumin, his clerk, the archbishopric
of Dublin, in Ireland, at Evesham, on the eighth day before
the ides of September. In the same year William, arch-
bishop of Rheims, came to England on a pilgrimage to the
Martyr Saint Thomas of Canterbury. In the same year Dufe-
nald, the son of William, the son of Dunecan, who had often
laid claim to the kingdom of Scotland, entered Scotland with a
large army, and laid waste the parts near the sea-coast. In this
year also, John, bishop of Saint Andrew's, pronounced sentence
of excommunication against Eichard de Morville, the constable,
and Richard de Prebenda, and others of the household of the king
of Scotland, who had caused a breach of the peace between
himself and the king. In addition to this, Roger, archbishop
of York, the legate in Scotland, and Hugh, bishop of Durham,
by the authority of our lord the pope, commanded the prior of
Saint Andrew's and the ecclesiastical personages throughout
the bishopric of Saint Andrew's, to go to John, their bishop, and
pay him the respect of their duteous submission, declaring that
if they refused, they would pronounce upon them, as being
contumacious and rebellious, sentence of suspension. On this,
some of the ecclesiastics of the bishopric of Saint Andrew's,
through fear of suspension, came to the before-named bishop
John ; on which William, the king of Scotland, expelled them
from his kingdom, with their sons and kinsmen, and even those
who, hanging at their mother's breasts, were yet crying in the
cradle. Roger, archbishop of York, and Hugh, bishop of
Durham, seeing the shocking proscription of these persons,
acted in obedience to the mandate of our lord the pope ; for
Roger, archbishop of York, excommunicated William, king of
Scotland, and both he and Hugh, bishop of Durham, pronounced
sentence of interdict on all the territories of the king of Scot-
land, ordering the bishops, abbats, priors, and other ecclesi-
astical persons strictly and inviolably to observe the said sen-
tence of interdict, and carefully to avoid the king himself as an
excommunicated person.



12 ANXALS OF KOGEE DE HOVEDEN. A. D. 1181.

In the same year died pope Alexander the Third, in the
twenty-second year of his papacy, and on the twelfth day before
the calends of October, being succeeded in the papacy by Imbald,
cardinal bishop of Ostia, who took the name of pope Lucius the
Third. In the same year, Eoger, archbishop of York, being
attacked with a severe illness, on perceiving the last day of his
life at hand, called together the abbats, priors, and other ecclesi-
astical persons of his diocese, and with becoming considerateness
distributed his property for the use of the poor, and among other
wondrous deeds of his power, 19 to perpetuate his praises, he sent
to William, archbishop of Rheims, and the other bishops of the
kingdom of France, more than five hundred pounds of silver
to be distributed among the poor. In like manner he left a
similar sum to the archbishop of Rouen and the other bishops of
Normandy ; and the same to the archbishop of Canterbury and
the other bishops of England. Having thus made distribution
of all his property, he removed from Gowda, where he was taken
ill, to York, the metropolitan see of his archiepiscopate, where
on the tenth day before the calends of December, being Satur-
day, at twilight, he departed this life, full of days, after having
happily ruled his archbishopric twenty-seven years and six
weeks. His body was buried by Hugh, bishop of Durham,
in the choir of the canons secular of the metropolitan church
at York ; William, the king of Scotland, still remaining under
the sentence of excommunication which the before-named arch-
bishop of York had pronounced against him.

Upon hearing of the death of the archbishop of York, Wil-
liam, king of Scotland, was greatly delighted ; and holding a
council with the bishops, earls, and elders of his territories, sent
Jocelyn, bishop of Glasgow, and Arnulph, abbat of Melrose,
and other wise and discreet ecclesiastics of his kingdom to
Rome, to Lucius, the Supreme Pontiff, in order that he might
be absolved from the said sentence of excommunication, and
that his lands might be released from the interdict, and in
order that, if in any way it could be brought about, John,
bishop of Saint Andrew's, might be deposed.

When word was brought to the king of England that the be-
fore-named archbishop had gone the way of all flesh, he sent his
servants throughout all the archbishopric of York, giving orders
that all of which the said archbishop in his illness had made
distribution should be confiscated ; which was accordingly
19 Charity rather, one would think.

done. For the entire devise, which in his illness he had made,
was, by the king's command, rendered null and void ; as our
lord the king asserted that the before-named archbishop of
York had pronounced an opinion in his lifetime that it was not
lawful for any ecclesiastical person to make a devise except at a
time before he was taken ill.

In the same ear, count Stephen, the uncle of Philip, king of
Prance, seized the lands of a certain person his neighbour,
and withheld them by force, and did homage for them to
Philip, earl of Flanders ; on doing which, the king of France
laid hands on them, and the earl of Flanders claimed restitu-
tution thereof to be made to himself and earl Theobald ; and
the king of France, refusing to accede thereto, the earl of
Flanders entered the territories of the king of France with a
hostile hand, and ravaged them. In the same year, Hugh,
earl of Chester, departed this life, and was succeeded in the
earldom by his son Ranulph.

After the death of Eoger, archbishop of York, our lord the
king gave orders to his justices in England to make diligent
inquisition as to the monies left by the before-named arch-
bishop, and wherever such were discovered, in his name, to
make demand thereof. In consequence of this, the said
justices demanded of Hugh, bishop of Durham, three hundred
marks of silver, which the said bishop had received out of
the monies of the archbishop, for the purpose of distribution
among the poor; on which he made answer to them: "I
distributed the three hundred marks of silver which you de-
mand of me, during the lifetime of the archbishop who
gave them to me, among the lepers, the blind, the lame, the
dumb, and the rest of the necessitous, and in the repair of
churches and bridges, for the salvation of his soul, according
as he himself had ordered ; therefore let him who wants them
collect them, for by me they will never be collected." Accord-
ingly, an answer of this nature exasperated the feelings of our
lord the king beyond measure, so much so, that he ordered
the castle of Durham to be seized in his name, in order that
the bishop might be harassed by every kind of persecution.

In the year of grace 1182, being the twenty-eighth year of
the reign of king Henry, son of the empress Matilda, the said
king was at Winchester, in England, on the day of the Nativity
of our Lord, which took place on the sixth day of the week.
In the same year died the count of Zelders, who had married



14 ANNALS OF KOGER DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1182,

the eldest daughter of Matthew, earl of Boulogne ; also the
countess of Flanders, daughter of Ralph de Peronne, and
wife of Philip, earl of Flanders. In the same year, Henry,
king of England, the father, crossed over from England to
Normandy, in consequence of the annoyances and vexations
which his son king Henry was causing him. For, having gone
with his wife to Philip, king of France, he was devising all
the evils he possibly could to the detriment of the king, his
father, contrary to good faith and the oaths of fealty which
he had often taken to him ; demanding of him, in conformity
with the advice of Philip, king of France, his wife's brother, the
whole of Normandy, or else some other part of his territories, in
which he and his wife might take up their abode, and from
which he might pay his knights and servants for their services.
However, the Divine grace inspiring him so to do, he returned
to his father, and swore that for the future he would not op-
pose his wishes or designs, or demand anything more of him
than a hundred pounds of money Anjouin per day for his ex-
penses, and ten pounds per day of the same money for his
wife's expenses ; in addition to which the king, the father,
agreed with the king, his son, that in the same year he would
give him the services of a hundred of his knights.

After this, the king, the father, held a conference, at which
were present the king of France and the earl of Flanders ;
on which occasion an arrangement was made between them
to the following effect ; that the lands of which the earl of
Flanders demanded restitution to be made to himself, should be
restored to the knight who had lost them, and that the earl of
Flanders should make good for the king of France the injuries
that he and his people had done in France, with reference to
the destruction by fire, and the booty that had been carried off. In
addition to this, the said earl quitted claim to the king of France
of the services of the count of Claremont, and delivered up to
the king of France the city of Amiens with its appurtenances,
and all the lands extending thence to the waters of the Lys
after his own decease, together with his niece, the daughter of
the earl of Hainault ; and the said earl made confession that
lawfully Peronne with its appurtenances was only in pledge
to himself, and agreed that the king of France should have pos-
session thereof for sixty thousand pounds of silver. At the same
conference, the said earl of Flanders delivered into the possession
of the king of England, the father, the agreement entered into



A.D. 1182. LETTER OP POPE LTTCTUS. 15

in writing by the king his son, and released him and his brothers
from all covenants made between them in the time of the war.
In the same year, pope Lucius the Third ordained John
Cumin priest, on the third day before the ides of March, at
Veletri ; and afterwards consecrated him archbishop of Dublin
at the same place, on the sixth day before the calends of April,
being Palm Sunday. In the same year, at the urgent request of
the envoys of the king of Scotland, namely, Jocelyn, bishop of
Glasgow, Arnold, abbat of Melrose, Osbert, abbat of Kelso, 21
and Walter, prior of Saint Columba of the Isle, pope
Lucius the Third absolved William king of Scotland from
the sentence of excommunication,, and his kingdom from the
interdict, at the palace of the Lateran, at Eome, in pre-
sence of his cardinals, namely, Peter de Pavia, bishop of
Tusculanum, the bishop of Prseneste, Albert, his chancellor,
Jacinto, Hugesun, Peter de Bova, master Yivianus, Reiner
the Great, Chinchechapel, Reiner the Little, Hardesrun, Har-
dewin, and Matthew of Anjou. After having so done, he
delivered letters of absolution to the before-mentioned envoys
of the king of Scotland, to the following effect :

The letter of pope Lucius on the absolution of William, king of
Scotland,

" Lucius, the bishop, servant of the servants of God, to his
venerable brethren the bishops, and the abbats, clergy, and people
throughout Scotland, health and the Apostolic benediction.
Inasmuch as the Apostle has directed that deference shall be
paid to kings as being of exalted station, it is worthy and
consistent with reason that we should pay them the highest
honor as our most dearly beloved sons, and, in performance
of our duty to Saint Peter and the holy Church of Home, give
all attention to their just desires. And whereas we have
heard that because our dearly beloved son in Christ, William,
the illustrious king of the Scots, was inexorably opposed to the
election and consecration of our venerable brother bishop
John, by virtue of letters of pope Alexander, our predecessor, of
holy memory, Roger, archbishop of York, of happy memory,
and the before-named bishop pronounced sentence of excom-
munication against him and his realm, and certain persons in
his kingdom. And whereas our venerable brother Jocelyn,

21 Called " Kelron" in tlie text. The abbat is called " Kalkoensis"
shortly after.



16 jLNNALS OF ROGER DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1182

bishop of Glasgow, and our dearly beloved sons, Arnold, abbat
of Melrose, Osbert, abbat of Kelso, and Walter, prior of
Saint Columba of the Isle, after coming for the said pur-
pose to the Apostolic See, have, by their declarations, made
proof and shewn before us and our brethren that the sentence
of excommunication pronounced by the said archbishop upon
the king, and that of interdict upon his kingdom, and the sen-
tence of excommunication pronounced by the said bishop upon
certain persons of his kingdom, ought reasonably and upon
numerous grounds to be set aside. Wherefore, paying due
deference to the before-named king as our most dearly beloved
son in Christ, we have, by the common consent of our brethren
and with the Apostolic authority, remitted all the sentence which
was pronounced by the before-named bishop 22 for the cause
before-mentioned, against him or his people, or his kingdom,
and have enacted that he and his people shall not be held to
be excommunicated, nor his kingdom to be under interdict, in
consequence of our sentence above-written. Wherefore, we do
by our precept, by these Apostolic writings, command the whole
of you that you will in no way hesitate to treat with him as a
Catholic king and as holding communion with the Apostolic See,
but will rather in all things pay him the honor that is his due.
For the more assured we feel of the sincerity of his duteousness
to the churches and ecclesiastical persons of his realm, the more
abundantly do we wish him to be honored in all things in
which, with due respect TO God, we can be honored. Given at
Velletri, this sixteenth day before the calends of April."

In the same year, the king of England sent his envoys,
namely, William de Mandeville, earl of Aumarle, and some other
persons of his household, to Frederic, the emperor of the Ro-
mans, in order that, if possible, they might avert his anger and
displeasure from Henry, duke of Saxony. Although this could
not be fully brought about, the emperor granted to all
who had chosen to depart with him, leave to return to their
country. In addition to this, the said emperor granted to
Matilda, duchess of Saxony, in consideration of the love he
bore to the king of England, her father, permission to remain
at perfect liberty and under his protection, and to enjoy all
her dowry freely and quietly ; and the emperor further agreed
that, if she should prefer to go into exile with her lord, he

viving. It is singular that the bishop of Durham is not mentioned.

would place keepers for the purpose of protecting her dowry.
The time therefore drawing nigh at which the before-named
duke was to withdraw from his country and kindred, he and
his wife, with their sons and daughters, and his counts and
barons, and the richest men of his territories, departed from
their country and kindred, and came to Normandy, to Henry,
king of England, the father of the before-named duchess, who
joyfully received them. Shortly after, the before-named duke
gave to his counts and barons, and the richer men of his territo-
ries, permission to return home, and the king of England, the
father of the duchess, bestowed on them many presents and then
dismissed them. The duke himself set out on a pilgrimage to
Saint Jago, 23 and the duchess his wife being pregnant, re-
mained with the king, her father, at Argenton in Normandy,
where she was shortly after delivered of a son.

In the same year, the Welch slew Ranulph Poer, the king's
sheriff of Gloucestershire. In this year also, Roland, the
bishop-elect of Dol and subdeacon of the Roman Church, came
into England on behalf of pope Lucius, for the purpose of
making peace between the king of Scotland and John, bishop
of Saint Andrew's ; and proceeded to the court of the king of
the Scots, together with Silvanus, the abbat of Rievaulx, his
colleague, where, after having for a long time negotiated upon
making peace between them, at their request the follow-
ing terms were made between the king and the before-named
bishop : Hugh was to abjure the bishopric of Saint Andrew's,
and bishop John was to release the said bishopric from all
claims whatever on his part and, instead thereof, he was to
have the bishopric of Dunkeld, and all the yearly revenues
which he had had before his election, as also the chancellorship
to the king, and forty marks of yearly revenue arising from the
bishopric of Saint Andrew's, during his life. Hugh, however,
when called upon by his lord the king of Scotland to abjure the
bishopric of Saint Andrew's, made answer that he would rather
receive judgment thereon at the Roman court, than in this way
abjure a bishopric to which he had been consecrated : and im-
mediately charged the letters which bishop John had obtained
against him from the Roman Pontiff with being forged, and ap-
pealed to the Roman Pontiff : upon which the before-named
Roland and the abbat Silvanus, being unable to proceed as they
ought, wrote to the Supreme Pontiff to the following effect :
23 Of Compostella.

18 ANNALS OF EOGEE DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1182.

TJie Letter of Roland, lishop-elect of Dol, and Silvanus, ablat
of Rievaulx, to pope Lucius.

"To the reverend father and lord, Lucius, by the grace of
God, supreme and universal Pontiff, Roland, by the like grace,
bishop-elect of Dol, servant of his Holiness, the foster-child of
the Apostolic See, and the least of the sub-deacons, and Sil-
vanus, appointed abbat of Bievaulx, the respect of duteous
obedience. After we had presented to bishop Hugh the letters
which that bishop charges with being forged, and those in
which the case is stated at length, and proposed, on receiving
leave of our lord the king of the Scots, to return home with all
haste, our lord the king entreated me, the bishop-elect of Dol,
with earnestness and anxiety, to pass by the way of the lord
bishop John, and, as a mark of his favour, to make him an
offer on his behalf of the bishopric of Dunkeld, with the
yearly revenues which he had before received in the bishopric
of Saint Andrew's, together with an increase of forty marks to
be received yearly, as also the office of chancellor to the king ;
and he further added that he would restore to him and his
every thing he had taken away, with the exception only of
what he knew to have already come to his hands, and would
restore them to the fulness of his favour, in the same manner
as had been previously offered him. He also desired that the
said bishop John would burn all documents that had been ob-
tained upon the matter of Saint Andrew's from your prede-
cessor Alexander, of pious memory. He also gave his sanction
that bishop Hugh should be transferred to the bishopric of
Glasgow, if bishop John should refuse to consent on other
terms, and if that could not be brought about, still he would
agree to what he had offered. On making offer of all these
things in presence of Hugh, the lord bishop of Durham, to
our lord John, he courteously acceded thereto on these terms :
namely, that he would never allow bishop Hugh to remain in
the enjoyment of the bishopric of Saint Andrew's. He was
also willing that the documents before-mentioned should be
put aside in some place, so that he could never make use of
them against the king's wishes. Upon this, we returned to the
king's presence, while bishop John waited for us near Rokel-
burg ; 24 on which the king informed us that it would give him
great pleasure if bishop Hugh could remain in the bishopric
84 Roxburgh.

of Saint Andrew's, and requested me to use my best endea-
vours to prevail upon bishop John to admit of this ; and when
I made answer to him that I would never again make any
request of him upon that point, because I had not been able to
make any impression upon him on the subject, his answer was,
' I am fully persuaded that since the lord John has returned to
reconciliation and favour with me, he will, on consideration of
my favour, and at the urgency of my entreaties, admit of this,
and I would gladly confer with him thereon ;' and the king
requested me to advise him to come and have a conference with
him. The king's clerks being accordingly sent to bishop John,
he made answer that he would not come, because he had heard
from certain advisers of our lord the king, that the king was
always endeavouring, in every possible way, to gain his point
that Hugh should remain in the bishopric of Saint Andrew's,
and asserted that, if he should be inclined to come, they were
not able to give him a safe conduct. When this answer was re-
turned him, our lord the king sent a bishop, and some abbats,
earls, and barons to the said bishop, requesting that he would
come to him for the purpose of an interview, and ordered them
to guarantee to the said bishop entire security. These, on their
return, stated that the lord John, inasmuch as he had a pre-
sentiment that his lord the king wished bishop Hugh to re-
main in the bishopric of Saint Andrew's, made answer that
he would never come to the king unless they should first make
oath that their lord the king would observe everything that
through me he had offered to him ; this, however, they were
unwilling to do, upon which, the lord John returned home.
"We, however, have appointed a stated time, on the calends of
October, for the before-named bishops, John and Hugh, to come
to you, and to submit to your judgment. Farewell."

In the same year died Walter, bishop of Rochester, and was
succeeded in the bishopric by Waleran, archdeacon of Bayeux.
In this year, while Walter, a servant of Eustace, the lord
abbat of Maye, was one night asleep, he heard a voice from
heaven, saying to him a first, second, and third time, "Go and
say to Henry, king of England, 'In the name of Christ, annihi-
late and destroy,' and say to him that so he must do, and, if he
does not do so, both his sons and himself shall die." On this
the before-named Walter made answer and said, " Who am I,
that I should carry thy commands unto the king r " To which
he received for answer, " Go to Hotrod, the archbishop of Rouen,

c2

and to his chaplain, and to Eustace, the abbat of Flaye, and they
shall remove the thorns and briars from out of thy path, and,
unless thou shalt make haste, thou shalt die." After the third
warning, therefore, the said Walter came to the before-named
archbishop of Rouen, and to his chaplain, and to abbat Eustace ;
and whereas, the archbishop and his chaplain, being worn out
with sickness and old age, could not attend to the matter,
they deputed the abbat of Flaye to act in their behalves ; on
which, he with his servant went to the king, and the servant
related to the king his vision and the accompanying threats ;
but the king, not being able to understand any part thereof,
and there being no one to interpret the vision to him, paid no
attention whatever to it ; and, shortly after, his son king Henry
died, and then his son Geoffrey, earl of Brittany. About the
time at which this vision took place many of the Manichaean
heretics 25 were burned in many places throughout the king-
dom of France, a thing that the king would in nowise allow
in his territories, although there were great numbers of them.

In the year of grace 1183, being the twenty-ninth year of
the reign of king Henry, son of the empress Matilda, the said
king of England was at Caen, in Normandy, on the day
of the Nativity of our Lord; the [young] king also, and
Richard and Geoffrey, his sons, and Henry, duke of Saxony,
and his wife, together with their sons and daughters, and a
large retinue, together with Richard, archbishop of Canterbury,
and John Cumin, archbishop of Dublin, and many bishops, earls,
and barons were there with him. After the Nativity of our
Lord, the king ordered the king, his son, to receive homage
from Richard, earl of Poitou, and from Geoffrey, earl of Brit-
tany, his brothers ; on which, in obedience to his father, he
received the homage of his brother Geoffrey, and was willing
to receive it from his brother Richard, but Richard refused to
do homage to him ; and afterwards, when Richard offered to
do homage to him, the king, the son, refused to receive it.
Richard, feeling greatly indignant at this, withdrew from the
court of the king, his father, and going to Poitou, his own
territory, built there some new castles and fortified the old
ones.

At the request of such of the earls and barons of Poitou as

25 " Publican!." Under this name the Albigenses, who were said to be
Manichaeans, are alluded to.



A>D. 118S. THE KINiJ QTJARKELS WITH HIS SONS. 21

adhered to him, and who inflicted many losses on earl Richard,
the king, his brother, pursued him. Geoffrey, earl of Brittany,
also came to Poitou, with a large force, to assist the king, his
brother. On Richard perceiving that he could not make head
against his brothers, he sent for assistance to the king, his
father, who, raising a great army, came in all haste, and laid
siege to the castle of Limoges, which had been a short time
before surrendered to the king, his son.

The cause of the dissensions between the Icing and his sons.

In order, however, that the cause may be known of these
shocking dissensions that took place between the father and his
sons, it ought to be stated that, on the holy day of the Circum-
cision of our Lord, king Henry, son of our lord the king of
England, of his own accord, and no one forcing him thereto,
touching the Holy Gospels, and in presence of a large body of
the clergy and laity, made oath that he would from that day
forward all the days of his life maintain his fealty un-
blemished to Henry, king of England, as being his father and
his liege lord, and would show him all due honor and obe-
dience. And because, as he asserted, the king wished to
retain no rancour and malice in his mind, by reason of which
his father might possibly be afterwards offended, he declared to
Kim that he had entered into a compact with the barons of Aqui-
"aine against his brother Richard, being influenced by the fact
hat his said brother had fortified the castle of Clairvaulx,
vhich was part of his own inheritance after his father's death,
contrary to his own wishes. Wherefore he earnestly entreated
his father to take the said castle from Richard, and keep it in
his own charge.

Richard, being admonished by our lord the king relative
thereto, at first refused to do so, but afterwards freely delivered
it to be disposed of at his father's pleasure. Accordingly,
the three sons of our lord the king, namely, the [young] king,
Richard, and Geoffrey, came to Anjou, with the king, their father,
for the purpose of entering into a final treaty of peace between
them ; and each of the three made oath that they would observe
their fealty at all times towards the king, their father, against
all men, and would pay him all honor and lasting obedience.
They also made oath, in accordance with the directions of their
father, that they would observe lasting peace between themselves.
On a given day, therefore, for ratifying the peace made between



22 ANNALS OF EOGEB DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1183.

them, at a place called Mirabel, under the direction of their
father, because the barons of Aquitaine, to whom the king,
the son, had engaged himself by oath, were not present, the
king, the father, sent his son Geoffrey to them that they might
come to the said conference for the establishment of peace and
reconciliation, and in the meantime cease from all hostilities.

But the said Geoffrey, utterly forgetful of God and of re-
spect for his father, and unmindful of his commands, did not
bring peace, but the sword, and, slighting his oath, his homage,
and the fealty which he had so often sworn to his father,
entered into a compact with the enemies of his father, for
the purpose of harassing him, and induced a sacrilegious race,
and one detested by the Church of Rome, 26 to ravage the ter-
ritories of his father. The king, the son, on hearing of this,
entreated his father to establish peace between his brother
Richard and the barons of Aquitaine. In answer to the
entreaties of his son, our lord the king promised that he would
preserve peace, and that, for this purpose, in the manner that
had been agreed upon in the preceding summer, reparation
should be made for all excesses committed by either party, or
else, if that should not please the barons, he would judge them
in conformity with the opinions pronounced by his court.
This offer was quite to the satisfaction of the king, the son ,*
on condition, however, that the castle of Clairvaulx should
remain safe in the hands of the king, his father.

Upon this, the king, the son, having gained of his father all
that he had requested, with his father's permission set out for
Limoges, for the purpose of inviting both his brother Geoffrey
and the barons of Aquitaine to come to terms, and in the
meantime sent his wife to France, to her brother, the king of
that country, for the purpose of being in safety. The king,
the father, also, at the request and by the advice of the king,
the son, came with a few followers by another road to Limoges,
in safety from his sons and in safety from his subjects; but when
he had come to this territory that was his own, his own subjects
received him most shamefully, for they aimed their arrows
against him, so much so that they even wantonly pierced his
coat armour, wounded one of his knights before his eyes, and
violently prevented the king from entering either the city or

" ruptuarii," or " Routiers," the employment of whom was forbidden by
the Church of Rome.

the castle ; in consequence of which, he and his son Richard
were obliged to depart.

After this, our lord the king effected an entrance into the city
of Limoges ; but when he was departing therefrom, for the pur-
pose of conversing with his sons in a fatherly manner, in pre-
sence of his sons, the garrison of the castle before-mentioned
aimed their deadly arrows; in consequence of which, they
wounded the horse which bore the king, the father, in the head,
and if the horse had not lifted its head just at the approach of
the arrow, it would have pierced the king's breast to a consi-
derable depth. This his sons Henry and Geoffrey thinking
lightly of, took no pains to punish the offender ; and, notwith-
standing, returned to the deadly foes of their lord and father.

Shortly after, the king, the son, came to his father, and pro-
mised him, that, if the barons of Aquitaine would not come to
his feet to sue for peace, he would utterly abandon them,
and return to obedience to him under all circumstances. On
this, the king the father, being moved at the entreaties of his
son, again made promise of the peace which he had previously
promised to the barons. Wherefore, the king the son, as he
said, went to his brother Geoffrey and the barons of Aqui-
taine, and, returning from them to his father, asserted that
they were utterly disobedient and rebellious, for which rea-
son, he had returned to his duty and obedience to his father's
will. This, however, as appeared in the sequel, was done
fraudulently, in order that in the meantime the perfidious
race of the Brabanters, and Geoffrey, that son of perdition,
might with lawless violence the more easily ravage his fa-
ther's territories, and nefariously lay them waste, carrying off
the ornaments of the churches, burning towns and villages to
the ground, emptying the fields and the sheepfolds by their
ravages, so as to cause utter destruction in every quarter;
sparing neither age, nor sex, nor rank, nor the religious pro-
fession ; on the contrary, as it appeared, aiming at the perpe-
tration of homicide, sacrilege, and rapine alone.

Shortly after these things had taken place, the king, the
son, on hearing what had been done by his brother Geoffrey,
told his father, that whatever he had done in this matter
had been done by the counsel of his brother Geoffrey, and
giving his arms and his horse in his father's charge, remained
with him some days. But after he had eaten at the same
table with his father, and had dipped his hands into the same



24 ANNALS OF ROGEK DE HOYEDEtT. A.D. 1183.

dish, he withdrew from him, and again leagued himself by
oath with his father's enemies, and then returning to his father,
declared that he could in no way see how he was to inflict upon
the men of the castle the punishment they had deserved ; after
which, leaving his father, he set out for Dorat.

But his father, thinking him peaceably inclined, recalled
him ; on which, returning and entering the castle, and not being
able to bring the wickedness which he contemplated to the
wished-for result, he swore by the body of Saint Martial, that
he would assume the cross. His father, however, thinking
that he had done this more through indignation than religious
feeling, in an affectionate manner used all his endeavours to re-
call him from this rash vow, asking of him on his knees, and
weeping, whether that vow had proceeded from rancour, in-
dignation, poverty, or religious feelings. To this the son
made answer, with all kinds of oaths, that he had made the
vow solely for the remission of the sins which he had been
guilty of towards his father ; and added, when he saw his
father opposing it and shedding tears, that he would slay
himself with his own hands, unless his father should cease to
dissuade him from his purpose of assuming the cross, inas-
much as the body of the Lord which he had that day beheld,
consecrated before his eyes, testified that he ought a long time
before that to have assumed the cross, but it had not till
then been disclosed to him ; hoping and trusting that he
should be in the more full enjoyment of his father's favour,
as he was unwilling to go on the .pilgrimage without his
favour. On this, his father learning his holy and fixed
determination, replied ; " The will of God and your own
be done. I will be your supporter and assistant in acquiring
the earldom, and will provide you, by the help of God, with
such plentiful supplies, that no one, of whom I have heard
going to the land of Jerusalem, could at any time have done his
service to God on a more bounteous scale."

On this, the king the son returned many thanks to his
father, and entreated him to deal mercifully with the men in
the castle and the barons of Aquitaine ; to which his father, in
tears, made answer, and promised that he would act in every
one of those matters quite according to his pleasure. The king
the son, again returning thanks, sent for the men of the castle,
and, though against his father's will, threw himself with the
burgesses at his father's feet, and asked for peace in their



A.D. 1183. TREACHEROUS CONDUCT OF GEOFFREY. 25

behalves, which request was granted, hostages however being
required to ensure the peace being kept. The king the father
sent some of his followers to receive the hostages, but they
were nearly slain by those who were to give them. This was
in nowise punished by the king the son, but, disregarding his
oath to assume the cross, he became, together with them, the
enemy and persecutor of his own father.

Shortly after, the king the son, pretending that he wished
for peace, requested his father to send to him Maurice de Crouy
with a truce, and some other barons ; and while some of their
followers were conversing with him, they were slain in the
presence of the king the son, by the enemies of our lord the
king. Some days after this, Geoffrey, that son of iniquity,
with evil intent, entreated that he would send to him Oliver
Fitz-Ernest and Jerome de Mustervol with a truce ; on which,
one of them, Jerome namely, was pierced with a sword through
his head-piece, his coat-armour, and his shirt, not without a
considerable loss of blood ; while Oliver, the other, was thrown
from a bridge into the water, in the presence of Geoffrey him-
self, who took no pains to punish this misdeed. After this,
the same son, being again desirous to hold a conference with his
father, came in perfect security to his father, and, deceitfully
treating about making peace, requested of his father leave to
enter the castle in order that he might prevail upon the king
his brother, and the other enemies of our lord the king, to
comply with the wishes of the king. Permission was ac-
cordingly given him, on which he entered the castle, spoiled
the shrine of Saint Martial, and carried off the other vessels
of that monastery, both gold and silver, and then, returning
with the booty, requested his father to prolong the truce till
the next day. The truce was accordingly granted him, and,
passing over the bridge, he the same day renounced the truce
with his father as being at an end, and out of the proceeds of
the sacrilege and robbery, of which he had been guilty towards
Saint Martial, paid their wages to his Brabanters. The
amount of this theft was, according to the estimate made by
worthy men, fifty-two marks of gold and twenty-seven marks
of silver.

In the meantime, Eichard, archbishop of Canterbury, Henry,
bishop of Bayeux, John, bishop of Evreux, Ralph, bishop of
Lisieux, Froger, bishop of Seez, and Waleran, bishop of Ro-



26 ANNALS OF BOGER DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1183.

Chester, together with the abbats and clergy of Normandy,
and a great number of people, came to Caen, and there, in the
monastery of Saint Stephen, solemnly, in the universal hear-
ing of all the people, pronounced sentence of excommunica-
tion against all who should prevent peace and reconciliation
being made between our lord the king and his sons, the person
of the king, the son, alone excepted.

Money now failing him, the king, the son, proceeded to
Saint Mary de Roche Andemar, stripped the tomb of Saint
Andemar, and carried away the treasures of the church. In
the course of a few days after this, the king, the son, seeing
that he could not do any material injury to the king, his
father, in consequence of indignation and rancour of mind,
was attacked by a severe malady at a village called Martel,
not far from the city of Limoges. He was first attacked with
a fever, and then by a flux of the bowels, which reduced him to
the point of death. On seeing that his death was impending,
he sent for our lord the king, his father, who refused to come
to him, as he dreaded his treachery. The king, the son,
having, therefore, summoned the bishops and religious men
who were there, into his presence, having first secretly, and
afterwards before them all, made confession of his sins, re-
ceived absolution and remission of his sins, and gave to Wil-
liam Marshal, one of his household, his cross to bear to Jeru-
salem [in his stead]. After this, laying aside his fine gar-
ments, he placed upon him haircloth, and fastening a cord
around his neck, said to the bishops and other religious men
who stood around him : "By this cord do I deliver myself, an
unworthy, culpable, and guilty sinner, unto you, the ministers
of God, beseeching that our Lord Jesus Christ, who remitted
his sins to the thief when confessing upon the cross, will,
through your prayers and His ineffable mercy, have compassion
upon my most wretched soul." To which all made answer,
" Amen." He then said to them : " Drag me out of this bed
by this cord, and place me on that bed strewed with ashes/'
which he had caused to be prepared for himself; on which
they did as he commanded them, and placed under his head
and feet two large square stones ; and, all things being thus
duly performed, he commanded his body to be taken to Rouen,
in Normandy, and there buried. After saying this, being
fortified with the viaticum of the holy body and blood of



A.D. 1183. DEATH AND BURIAL OF THE KING, THE SON. 27

our Lord, in the fear of the Lord, he breathed forth his
spirit.

When news was brought of his death to our lord the king,
his father, bursting into tears, he threw himself upon the ground,
and greatly bewailed his son. how dreadful a thing it is
for sons to persecute a father ! for it is not the sword of the
man who fights, not the hand of the foeman that avenges the
injury of the father ; but it is fever that deals its retribution,
flux of the bowels, with ulceration of the intestines, that ex-
ercises vengeance. The son laid prostrate, all return to the
father. All are overjoyed, all rejoice, the father alone bewails
his son. Why, glorious father, dost thou bewail him ? He was no
son of thine, who could commit such violence upon thy fatherly
affection. This defence of thee has wrought security for
fathers, and has checked the audacity of parricides. For it
was his due to perish by a severe retribution, who wished to
introduce parricide into the world ; because the Judge of all
minds, in the same way that He avenges the tribulations of the
righteous, so does he sometimes punish the persecutions of the
wicked.

The king's servants, after having extracted the brain and
the entrails, and buried them at M artel, sprinkled the body
of the dead king with large quantities of salt, and then
wrapped it in bulls' hides and lead, that they might take it to
Rouen for burial there, and accordingly set out on their way
with the royal body ; but when they had come to the city
of Le Mans, and had passed the night in the church of Saint
Julian the Confessor and Pontiff, singing hymns and psalms
in its vicinity, and wished in the morning to depart thence
with the body, the bishop of the city and the clergy, together
with the common people, would not allow them to carry it
away, but buried it in an honorable manner in the church of
Saint Julian.

On this being told to the people of Rouen, they were indig-
nant thereat, and resolutely demanded his body, swearing that
they would take it by force, unless it was instantly given up
to them ; upon which the king, the father, ordered that the
body should be given up to the people of Rouen, as the king,
his son, had, while living, commanded ; which was accord-
ingly done; and they dug up the king's body from the spot



28 ANNALS OF EOGER DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1183.

where it had been buried, and, carrying it to Rouen, buried it
in the church there of Saint Mary.

The kingj the father, after the death of the king, his son,
every day made more violent assaults upon the castle of Li-
moges, to which he had laid siege, and at length both the
castle and the city of Limoges were surrendered to him, be-
sides all the castles of his enemies in that neighbourhood ;
some of which he retained in his own hands, and some he
levelled with the ground, not leaving one stone upon another.
After the death of the king, the son, Philip, king of the Franks,
demanded of our lord the king of England, the dowry which
his son, the king, had given to his sister, and the whole of the
land of the Vexin, together with the castles and fortresses which
Louis, king of France, his father, had given them on their mar-
riage. Whereupon, a conference being held between them, be-
tween Gisors and Trie, an arrangement was made in the follow-
ing manner : That Margaret, the sister of the king of France,
who had been the wife of the king, the son, should receive, for
quitting claim of all the above demands, one thousand seven
hundred and fifty pounds of money Anjouin, each year at Paris
from our lord the king of England and his heirs, so long as
she should live.

In the same year our lord the king gave the bishopric of
Lincoln to Walter de Coutances, his clerk, whom Richard,
archbishop of Canterbury, consecrated at Anjou, and sent to
England to his see, which had now been vacant for a period of
eighteen years, namely, from the time of Robert de Chennay,
bishop of Lincoln, until now. Geoffrey, earl of Brittany, the
king's son, now returned to his father and made peace with
him and with his brother, Richard, earl of Poitou.

In the same year, John and Hugh, the bishops, of whom we
have previously made mention, came to Velletri to have an
audience of Pope Lucius, and each of them stated, in pre-
sence of our lord the pope and of all his cardinals, the
claims that he asserted upon the bishopric of Saint Andrew's.
After hearing them, our lord, the pope, by the common ad-
vice of his brethren, took the bishopric from them both, and
they freely and absolutely resigned the said bishopric of Saint
Andrew's into the hands of the Supreme Pontiff, and then with-
drew from the court, awaiting the mercy of the Supreme Pon-
tiff ; and a few days after, by the advice of all his cardinals,



A.D. 1183. DISSENSION BETWEEN THE EOMANS AND THE POPE. 29

the Supreme Pontiff gave to bishop Hugh the bishopric of Saint
Andrew's, and confirmed him in possession thereof ; and granted
to bishop John the bishopric of Dunkeld, together with all the
things before mentioned that had been offered him on part of
the king of Scotland, and confirmed him therein. On this,
Hugh returned home and received the bishopric of Saint An-
drew's. Bishop John also received the bishopric of Dunkeld ;
but as the king of Scotland declined to restore to him what he
had taken away, he again put forward his claims against
bishop Hugh as to the bishopric of Saint Andrew's, as stated in
the sequel.

In the same year, our lord the king commanded Eichard, his
son and heir, to receive the homage of his brother John for
Poitou, but he declined receiving it. In the same year a
grievous dissension arose between the Romans and pope Lucius,
relative to certain customs which his predecessors had been in
the habit of following, but which the pope above-named swore
he would never comply with. At this the Romans were indig-
nant, and were frequently guilty of ravages and incendiarism
in the territories of our lord the pope ; on which, the pope flying
from place to place, took refuge in his castles and fortified cities.
To defend him there came Christian, archbishop of Mentz, chan-
cellor of the lord Frederick, emperor of the Romans, having
levied a large army for that purpose. The Romans, being unable
to oppose him, returned to Rome, on which the before-named
chancellor, pursuing them, laid waste every thing that belonged
to the Romans, and followed them even to the very gates of
the city of Rome, setting fire to all the suburbs thereof.

On this, the Romans, seeing that they were devoted to ruin,
devised how they might slay the before-named chancellor by
stratagem ; and, as all other modes were wanting to them, they
determined to take him off by means of poison, and did so.
For when the said chancellor and his army were at a distance
of nearly ten miles from the city, the Romans sent envoys, clad
in the garb of poor men, to learn the state of the court, who,
after learning all particulars relating thereto, discovered,
among other matters, one thing which they made choice of in
order to effect his destruction. For there was near that spot a
spring of water exceedingly limpid, the water of which, mixed
with wine, the chancellor and his army were in the habit of
drinking. Accordingly, these wicked traitors went to the spring,



SO ANNALS OF EOGEE DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1183.

and drugged it thoroughly with poison, so that the water
flowing therefrom was corrupted. Consequently, on the chan-
cellor drinking thereof, he died by a speedy death. There
also died after him more than a thousand men who had drank
of the said spring. When the death of the chancellor became
publicly known, his army was dispersed and put to flight, on
which the Romans rose in rebellion with still greater acrimony
against our lord the pope.

In the same year, Philip, earl of Flanders, married the
sister of Sancho, king of Portugal. In this year, also, our lord
the king of England gave the archbishopric of Eouen to Walter
de Coutances, bishop of Lincoln, and Lucius, our lord the
pope, sent him the pall. The said pope, not being able suc-
cessfully to oppose the Romans, sent his ambassadors to the
kings and chief men of the various countries, both secular and
ecclesiastical, to gain assistance in the defence of Saint Peter
against the Romans : upon which his envoys came to Henry,
king of England, to ask him, and the clergy of England, to afford
him assistance. Accordingly, the king consulted his bishops and
the clergy of England, as to the prayer of the Supreme Pontiff;
on which the bishops and clergy advised him, according to his
own inclination and honor, to give assistance to our lord the
pope, both on his own behalf as well as on theirs ; inasmuch
as it would be more endurable to them, and would please them
better, that their lord the king should, if he so pleased, receive
from them a recompense for such assistance, than if he should
allow the nuncios of our lord the pope to come to England to
receive assistance from themselves ; as, if any other step than
the one named were taken, it might possibly be turned into a
precedent, to the detriment of the kingdom. The king acquiesced
in their advice, and gave considerable assistance to the pope, in
gold and silver.

Accordingly, by means of this money, and other sums of
money lent to him by other princes from all quarters, our lord
the pope made peace with the Romans, which was necessary
for him and the Church of Rome.

In the same year, died Rotrod, archbishop of Rouen, and
was succeeded by 27 Walter, bishop of Lincoln. In this year
also died Richard Pecche, bishop of Chester, who was suc-

ceeded by Gerard Lapucelle. 28 In the same year, Gilbert, stir-
named Assaili, grand master of the house of the Hospital
at Jerusalem, came into Normandy to king Henry, and was
honorably entertained by him. Having obtained the king's per-
mission to cross over to England, he came to Dieppe, and, be-
fore the feast of Saint Michael, embarked on board of a ship
which had been lying for nearly a year upon the sands of the
sea-shore, shattered and dried up, and had lately been a little
repaired and refitted, and launched again, together with many
other persons, clergy as well as laity, who had become tired
with waiting : but shortly after, when the vessel had got out
of harbour into the open sea, the seams opening, it went
down into the deep, just like a stone ; on which Gilbert, and all
the rest who were on board of it, with the exception of eight
only, who escaped by means of a boat, were drowned, on the
thirteenth day before the calends of October. In the same
year, Henry, king of England, a conference being held on
the day of Saint Nicholas, between him and Philip, king of
France, between Gisors and Trie, did homage to Philip, king
of France, for all his lands beyond sea, whereas before this
he had never been willing to do homage to him.

In the year of grace 1184, being the thirtieth year of the
reign of Henry, king of England, son of the empress Matilda,
the said king was at Le Mans on the day of the Nativity of our
Lord, which took place on the Lord's day. In the same year,
Richard, archbishop of Canterbury, departed this life on the
fourteenth day before the calends of March ; to whom, before
he was taken ill, the Lord appeared in a vision, saying, "Thou
hast wasted the property of my church, and I will root thee from
out of the earth." Being greatly terrified at this vision, he
immediately fell ill, and died on the eighth day after. In
the same year, the king of England, having made peace be-
tween Philip, king of France, and Philip, earl of Flanders,
with reference to the disputes that existed between them con-
cerning the land of Vermandois, passed through the middle of
Flanders, and crossed over from Witsand to Dover, in Eng-
land, where he landed on the fourth day before the ides of
June; his daughter, the duchess of Saxony, crossing over
with him.

28 Roger of Wendover says, that he died within ten weeks of his con-
secration.



32 AtfNALS OF KOGEB. DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1184.

In the same year, and the same week in which the king
landed in England, a spring of running water, near the church
of Saint Winin, in the western parts of the territories of
the king of Scotland, below Tyningham, and not far from the
castle of Irwine, 29 flowed with blood, without intermission,
for eight days and as many nights. In the same year, the
king's daughter, the duchess of Saxony, was delivered of a
Bon at Winchester. In this year also, Theobald, count of Blois,
uncle to Philip, king of France, came into England on a pilgrim-
age to Saint Thomas, at Canterbury. In this year also, Henry,
duke of Saxony, the king's son-in-law, came to England. In
the same year died Simon, earl of Huntingdon, on whose de-
cease the king gave the said earldom to William, king of the
Scots ; immediately on which, in presence of the king, he con-
ferred the earldom on his brother David.

In the same year, Gilbert de Plumpton, a knight of noble
birth, being led in chains to Worcester, and accused of rape
before our lord, the king of England, by Kanulph de Glau-
ville, justiciary of England, who wished to condemn him, he
was by an unjust judgment condemned to be hanged on a
gibbet ; and when he was led forth to the gibbet, there met
him a multitude of men and women, crying aloud and saying,
that a righteous and innocent man ought not thus to suffer.
Upon this, Baldwin, the bishop of Worcester, a religious man and
one who feared God, hearing the shouts of the people, and learn-
ing the injustice that was being perpetrated against this wretched
man, ran after him ; but the ministers of wickedness, hastening
to perpetrate their crime, fastening a rope round his neck had
suspended him aloft, when lo ! the bishop of Worcester came
up in all haste, and said to the executioners ; " In behalf of
Almighty God, and under pain of excommunication, I forbid
you to put that man to death this day, for it is the Lord's day,
and the feast of Saint Mary Magdalen." At these words
the executioners stood astounded, hesitating what to do, for
they feared the king's justice, and dreaded sentence of excom-
munication. However, the Divine power prevailed, and 1'rom
respect for the solemnity of the day, they loosed the rope and let
him come to the ground, to be kept until the next morning ;
when he was to undergo the same punishment. That same
night, our lord the king, being moved with pity, and influenced
29 Irving.

by the counsels of his followers, commanded that he should re-
main as he was, until he should give further orders what was
to be done with him; for he was aware that Eanulph de
Glanville had thus acted towards him from feelings of dislike,
and wished to put him to death on account of his wife, the
daughter of Eoger Gulewast, whom the said Eanulph wished
to give in marriage, together with her inheritance, to his friend
Eeiner, the sheriff of York. Accordingly, the knight, being
rescued from death, was kept in prison by Eanulph de Glan-
ville, until the king's death.

After this, our lord the king came to Eeading, and holding
a council there as to choosing a pastor for the Church of Can-
terbury, a strife and contention arose between the monks of
Canterbury and the bishops of England. For the monks
claimed to have the first voice in the election, and produced a
charter of our lord the king, by which he had granted and
confirmed to them freedom of election. The bishops, on the
other hand, used their best endeavours to prove that that charter
ought not to be observed, both because it was made contrary
to law, and tended to the injury of the Church of England, as
also, because the election of their own metropolitan belonged to
themselves. In consequence of this dispute, no terms could be
come to between them on the present occasion.

By command of our lord the king, the bishops of England
and the monks of Canterbury met at London, in the king's
presence, for the election of an archbishop of Canterbury ; and,
the contention still continuing, Gilbert, bishop of London,
who, according to the ancient right of his see, had the first
voice in the election, made choice of Baldwin, the bishop of
"Worcester, as archbishop of Canterbury, on the fourth day be-
fore the nones of December ; upon which all the bishops gave
their assent to that choice ; the monks of the Church of Can-
terbury, being the only persons who made any opposition, de-
parted for the purpose of appealing to our lord the pope, and
the bishops of England presented to the king the person whom
they had elected. On their presentation and election, our lord
the king received him with the kiss of peace and love ; which
example was followed by Eichard, Geoffrey, and John, the
king's sons.

After this, our lord the king came to Canterbury, for the
purpose of putting an end to the angry feelings of the monks,

and, holding a conference with them, prevailed upon them to
elect as their archbishop the before-named Baldwin, which
they accordingly did ; for Alan, the prior of the church of the
Holy Trinity at Canterbury, came to London with the less in-
firm part of his chapter, and with letters of confirmation. On
their meeting together in the Chapter house of the monks of
Westminster, they elected for themselves and the Church of
Canterbury, the before-named Baldwin as archbishop ; and then,
that they might not appear to have assented to the election of
the bishops, sang their own " Te Deum Laudamus" and led
him to the altar, and, receiving him with the kiss of peace,
presented him to the king, who again received him with the
kiss of peace and love ; as did Richard, earl of Poitou, his son.
After this, the king confirmed the treaty and final reconciliation
by writing, and ratified the same, after its confirmation, by
oath on part of his sons Richard, Geoffrey, and John, in presence
of queen. Eleanor their mother, Henry, duke of Saxony, and
many others.

In the same year, the archbishop of Cologne came to Eng-
land on a pilgrimage to Saint Thomas of Canterbury, on which
the king of England met him with congratulations, and prevailed
upon him to lay aside his anger and displeasure towards Henry,
duke of Saxony, and receive him into the favour which he
had formerly enjoyed when honored with his esteem. The
before-named archbishop of Cologne also, at the entreaty of the
king of England, agreed that the daughter of Frederic, emperor
of the Romans, should be given in marriage to Richard, earl of
Poitou, the king's son : for he knew that this was the especial
wish and desire of the emperor. After this, the before-named
archbishop, and Philip, earl of Flanders, who had come with
him over to England, returned to Flanders, and, having levied
a great army, invaded the territories of the earl of Hainault,
and ravaged them, in revenge for the injuries which he had
inflicted on the earl of Flanders.

In the same year, died the empress of the Romans, the wife
of the emperor Frederic. In this year also, died Gilbert de
Ver, abbat of Selby, and Gerard, 30 sumamed La Pucelle,
bishop of Chester. In the same year also, died "Waleran, bishop
of Rochester, Clement, abbat of Saint Mary's at York, Simon,
earl of Huntingdon, Jocelyn, bishop of Salisbury, Bartholomew,
30 See the note at page 31.



A.D. 1184. THE KING MARCHES TOWARDS WALES. 35

bishop of Exeter, and the earl of Warwick. In this year
also, died the daughter of Frederic, emperor of the Eomans,
who, as above stated, was to have been married to Richard,
earl of Poitou. In this year also, the church of Saint Julian,
at the city of Le Mans, was destroyed by fire. The abbey of
Glastonbury was also burnt in this year.

In the same year, our lord the king of England, being
anxious to make peace between the duke of Saxony and the
emperor Frederic, by the advice of the archbishop of Cologne,
sent his envoys, Hugh de Kunant, archdeacon of Lisieux, and
some others of his clerks, and of the members of his household.,
to Lucius, the Supreme Pontiff, in order that through his aid the
before-named emperor might receive the duke of Saxony into
favour. Accordingly, the king's envoys, coming to the court of
our lord the pope, found him at Verona in Italy ; and while they
were staying there with him, Frederic, emperor of the Romans,
came thither for the purpose of holding a conference with
the pope ; at whose urgent request the before-named em-
peror gave the duke of Saxony permission to return to his
country, and released him from all the oaths which he had
taken as to remaining in exile ; our lord the pope also absolved
him from the oath which he had taken to the emperor.

In the same year, Thomas Fitz-Bernard departed this life,
who, after the decease of Alan de Neville, had been appointed
by our lord the king chief justiciary of all the forests in
England ; upon whose decease our lord the king divided his
forests in England into different parts, and over each part ap-
pointed four justices, namely, two clerks and two knights ;
also two yeomen of his household to be guardians of vert and
venison, over all the other foresters, both those of the king as
well as of the knights and barons ; and he sent them to hold
pleas of forestal matters, in conformity with the Assize of the
Forests previously mentioned.

In the same year, our lord the king came to Worcester, for
the purpose of marching thence with a large army into Wales,
to wage war against the Welch, who had ravaged his territories
and slain his subjects. Rees, 31 the son of Griffin, however, dread-
ing his attack, having obtained a safe-conduct from the king,
came to Worcester, and there swore fealty to the king of Eng-
land, and that he would give his son and nephews as hostages
31 Rice, or Rhys ap Griflyd.

to the king ; but, on his attempting to bring them, they refused
to accompany him.

In the same year, our lord the king gave to William, the
prior of the church of Saint Augustin, at Bristol, the bishopric
of Bangor. In the same year, the priest Swerre, who was
also called Birkebain, slew Magnus, king of Norway.

In this year also, the astrologers both of Spain and Sicily, as
also the diviners throughout almost the whole world, both Greek
and Latin, wrote and set forth nearly one and the same opinion
as to the conjunction of the planets. On this occasion, a certain
astrologer, Corumphira by name, wrote to the following effect :

Auguries from the Conjunction of the Planets.

" In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the
Holy Ghost. Amen. Almighty God hath known and the
science of numbers hath disclosed, that the planets, both supe-
rior as well as inferior, will come in conjunction in Libra, that
is to say in September, in the year from the Incarnation of our
Lord Jesus Christ, the eternal and true God, one thousand one
hundred and eighty-six; and in the year of the Arabians five
hundred and eighty-two. 32 During the year this conjunction
will be preceded by a partial eclipse of the sun, which will be
of a fiery colour ; this, taking place on the first hour of the
twenty-first day of the month of April, will be preceded by
a total eclipse of the moon, in the said month of April ; that
is to say, on the fifth day thereof, and at the first hour of
the night that shall precede Wednesday ; this, if God shall so
will, nay rather because He does so will, shall so will, hath so
willed, 4 and will not cease so to will. Therefore, in the year
before-named, the planets being, by the will of God, in Libra,
that is to say, in an aerial and windy sign, the Dragon also
contributing as a cause thereto, a wondrous earthquake will
take place, and especially in those regions in which such
things have been in the habit of taking place, and will
destroy certain places that have been subject to earthquakes
and liable to the mischances of utter ruin. For in the parts
of the East there shall arise a mighty wind, and with its
strong blasts it shall blacken the air and shall corrupt it with its

poisonous stench. In consequence, a mortality and sickness
will attack great numbers, and loud peals will be heard, and
voices in the air that shall terrify the hearts of those who hear
them, and the wind shall raise aloft the sands and the dust
from the face of the earth, and shall utterly overwhelm the
cities situate on the plain, and especially those in the sandy
regions, those in the fifth climate, to wit ; as Mecca, Barsara,
Baldac, 33 and Babylon ; nor shall any land be left otherwise than
covered with the sand and dust, and be utterly ruined thereby ;
so much so, that the regions of Egypt and Ethiopia shall
become almost uninhabitable. And from the West this cala-
mity will extend to all parts of the East. In the regions of
the West also shall arise dissensions.; and seditions of the
people shall take place, and there shall be one of them who
shall levy armies innumerable, and shall wage war on the
shore of the waters, on which a slaughter so vast will take
place that the flow of the blood so shed will equal the surging
waves. Let each person feel assured that the conjunction about
to take place, whatever others may say, signifies to me, if God so
wills, the mutation of kingdoms, the superiority of the Franks,
the destruction of the Saracenic race, with the superior blessed-
ness of the religion of Christ, and its especial exaltation, toge-
ther with longer life to those who shall be born hereafter."

In like manner, William the Astrologer, clerk to John, the
constable of Chester, wrote concerning the before-mentioned
conjunctions of the planets to the following effect :

" In the year from the Incarnation of our Lord one thousand
one hundred and eighty-six, in the month of August, on the
completion of the thirtieth day thereof, and in the following
night, at the ninth hour, in the twenty-ninth degree of Virgo,
which is called the degree of periods and the period of woes,
Leo being in the ascendant, this conjunction, which is called
a minor conjunction, is most portentous. Evil is predominant
in this figure. This is followed by a conjunction of Mars and
Saturn, in the fourth degree of Libra, on the seventh day of
September, at the fourth hour, being the first day of the week ;
the Sun being the lord of the hour, and Sagittarius the horos-
cope. This conjunction is called a mid-conjunction. In this
conjunction good fortune is predominant ; and in this inclination

evil is mitigated. Then follows a conjunction of Jupiter and
Saturn, which is styled a major conjunction, in the eighth de-
gree of Libra, on the tenth day of October, being the sixth day
of the week, at the ninth hour. Mercury is then the lord of
the hour, Capricorn the horoscope ; Mars being in conjunction
in the fourteenth degree with the Tail of the Dragon. This con-
junction portends wondrous events; thunder and lightning, with
fiery flashes running to and fro in the air. But not regarding
the conjunction of these, be it our part to record by figure what
other persons have couched under an enigmatical form, as to
the conjunction of all the planets in Libra, which will have an
effect in our day before unknown, and not to be known in times
to come. This conjunction will take place on the sixteenth
day of September, being the third day of the week, at the
first hour j Mars being the lord of the hour, and the Sun in
the East, and the planets in their several places, as follows :
Libra being the horoscope, 33 * and beginning in the first degree
[of longitude] ; the Sun being in the thirtieth degree of Yirgo ;
Jupiter in two degrees three minutes ; Venus in three degrees
forty - nine minutes ; Saturn in eight degrees six minutes ;
Mercury in four degrees ten minutes ; Mars in nine degrees
eighteen minutes ; the Tail [of the Dragon] in eighteen degrees
twenty- three minutes ; the Part of Warfare in fifteen degrees ;
the Moon in seventeen degrees eight minutes ; the Part of For-
tune in nineteen degrees. The second [horoscope] is Libra,
beginning at its twenty-fifth degree. The third is Scorpio, be-
ginning at its twenty-fourth degree. The fourth is Capricorn,
beginning at its first degree. The fifth is Aquarius, beginning
at its fifth degree. The sixth is Pisces, beginning at its seventh
degree. The seventh is Aries, beginning at its first degree.
Now, as Saturn is most elevated in orbit, let us first treat of
him. He signifies the Pagans, and all who are opposed to the
laws of Christianity. Now, inasmuch as in the figure of the
sphere Saturn is in the mid-heaven governing the [airy] tri-
plicity, from the triplicity of the figure the Saracen magi-
cians 34 are auguring victory on their side, especially as the Sun

33 * Also called " the house " by more recent astrologers.

34 It is possible that this may be the meaning of the mystic letters
which here occur; Tr. G. F. S. M. standing for " Triplicitate figurae
gentis Saracenae magi." If not, those who are skilled in judicial astrology
may, possibly, be able to give a better translation.



A.D. 1184. ASTROLOGICAL PREDICTIONS. 39

at his setting is seeking the superior conjunction of the planets.
However, from an estimate of the figure we form a very dif-
ferent opinion. For the Sun signifies the potentates of Chris-
tendom, and in this figure is seeking conjunction with Jupiter ;
but Jupiter, being powerless, seeks conjunction with Venus,
and she with Saturn. Mercury then, by retrograding, cut-
ting it off, 35 would naturally appear by his retrograde motion
to indicate the elevation of their religion and the depression of
our own. But as Mercury imparts this same disposition to
Jupiter, and Jupiter imparts it to none, 36 this marks the lasting
nature of our faith. Now since the Sun is of the greatest influ-
ence in this figure, a man, a Christian, is arising among us, one
of great fame, whose name will be exalted until the end of the
world. 38 But because this conjunction takes place in a change-
able sign, the career of this person will be closed before Saturn
shall have passed through this sign; and inasmuch as Jupiter
denotes power of prophecy, he will at last be enumerated among
the prophets. In this figure, Mars being separated from Saturn,
transfers the properties of Saturn to the Tail [of the Dragon] ;
which not retaining this position, as though by a retrograde
movement, carries back again towards Mars what has been so
entrusted to it. But, inasmuch as Mars is being scorched by the
orb of the Sun, being thus impeded and embarrassed between
two evils, Saturn and the Tail [of the Dragon], he becomes in-
fected with their nature, and signifies by his properties, sorrows,
contentions, alarms, catastrophes, murders, and spoliation of
property. The Tail also signifies separations, losses, dangers,
and diminution of possessions ; and because Mars forms an evil
conjunction with the Tail [of the Dragon] in the ascendant,
I do therefore contradict the judgment pronounced by Albu-
masar upon this figure in his Hundred Discourses. 39 Turn your
eyes from the figure in which Mars is at the greatest angle
when Scorpio is in the ascendant, or when he is with the
Tail ; 40 and as it is evident to every astrologer that Saturn
has an influence over this climate, the Moon participating with
him, I am of opinion that he cannot be considered as exempt

word may have some cabalistic meaning, It hardly seems to belong to
the European families of words. It is also very possible that it may be
a misprint for, "sevi," "of time."

from the evil before-mentioned. Wherefore, the only remedy
remaining is, for princes to be on their guard, to serve God
and eschew the devil, that so the Lord may avert their immi-
nent punishments. Amen."

Again, with reference to the before-mentioned conjunction
of the planets, the following was written :

" To all literate men, and especially to scholars, to whose
presence this present page shall come, Anselm, the humble
brother in the Lord, of the monastery at "Worcester, greeting.
Marvellous is God in His Saints and in His works, who never
ceases to work miracles in behalf of His people. And, inasmuch
as no man places a light under a bushel, but upon a candlestick,
that it may give light to all, a miracle, wondrous beyond mea-
sure, took place in our house on the day before the calends of
November ; which, in order that it might come to the knowledge
of those not present, by writing at least, I have committed to
writing. Be it known then unto your discreetness, that one of
our lay brothers, falling into a trance, lay nine days and nine
nights like one dead before a certain altar, prostrate there in the
form of a cross ; 41 and as he was a religious man, and a brother
of a holy mode of life, no one of us dared to remove Jrirn
thence. On the tenth day, at the third hour, in a low voice,
and with a wailing tone, still in a wondrous lament, he
chaunted the following lines ten times or even more, in the
same order in which they are here written :

42 u < r^e f a j} mankind an( } the sudden ruin of this world,
a pernicious fatality is hurrying on. Children of tender age
one universal slaughter overwhelms ; by the same death young
and old must die. The water shall be tainted by the cor-
ruption of the substance of the air, and with deadly dew
shall the whole ground be drenched. Hence shall a dread-
ful mortality arise, and universal carnage. A universal cause
is there of death, a universal cause of woe. For as soon
as the Sun shall touch the back of the Lion slain by Her-
cules, a two-fold heat shall parch the entrails dried-up. Then,
though there shall be a thousand like Lachesis, and even
hands as many to each, still, at the same instant will Atropos
cut all their threads. For with the sword of death will the
just vengeance of God visit the sins of the people. Ah wretched

me ! alas ! what will be my lot ? Behold ! the sword is gleam-
ing, which will the whole world destroy. Behold the hand of
the Lord ! Ah wretched me ! whither shall I fly ? Behold the
wrath of the Lord ! shall I take to flight, or here conceal my-
self? Whither shall I fly from God, for God is everywhere ?
If the Divine will cannot be moved by prayer, then the seed
with the chaff will the wrath of God beat down. That all
things must return unto their ancient Chaos, the opinions of
the philosophers prove. Still, thus it cannot be, as it is clear
that whatever has been, and most things that now are, must
remain as they are. 43 Now, above the stars am I borne, and
though my eyes are closed, lifted up to the stars, either house
of the Sun do I behold. There is night without the stars and
Moon, and day without the Sun : but though so it is, why
so it is I cannot tell. The stars of Mercury, of Venus, and
of Jove, now lie concealed. They exist not, or if they do
exist, they have forsaken the sky. Through the whole Zodiac
they roam at large, both Mars and the noxious star of the
scythe-bearing old man who wields the scythe. 44 Mars smites
with his sword, Saturn smites with his hurtful scythe ; 45 he
strives to inflict ruin on the interests of men. Hence am I
now borne to the dubious realms of the Stygian tyrant, in which
there is, and will be, everlasting gloom. Amid gloom so great,
neither Sun, nor Moon, nor fire, in this place of wretchedness
are able to direct the eyes. Here is toil, and grief, and anxiety
inextricable : here for the wretched guilty are grievous punish-
ments prepared. Here resounds everlastingly the direful dirge,
woe ! woe ! The gloom how great ! woe, woe is me ! woe !
woe ! ** Cerberus is raging before the gates, and is yawning
with his three throats ; three dreadful sounds from his mouth
at the same instant does he send. Three Furies guard the
portals, Alecto, Megaera, and Tisiphone, on whose features horror
is impressed. Horrid is their aspect, and foul the breath of

43 These lines are in their present state incapable of being reduced to
sense perhaps, indeed, it was never intended they should have any. They
are as follows ;

" Sic taraen esse nequit, quia constat quaeque fuisse,

41 Saturn. 45 "Falce;" more properly " sickle."

46 This pentameter is worth preserving as a curiosity :

" Quantae sunt tenebrae ! vae mihi, vae mini, vae !"

their mouths, and their hoarse voices sound like thunder in
their throats. In all there is an innate propensity to wick-
edness in their minds ; in all there is a disposition prone to
every crime. In the midst of the water stands Tantalus,
thirsting with it up to his throat ; while, that he may not
drink thereof, it ever retreats from his mouth. Here is mighty
Sisyphus rolling the stone that rolls everlastingly back ; so
that his is a labour without an end. Continually does the de-
vouring vulture gnaw at the liver of Tityus ; which, that it
may be for ever perishing, is ever on the point of perishing.
Some dreadful famine, some severe drought attacks, and labour
without cessation fatigues. Some are frozen by cold, others
are scorched by the heat of flames ; each as he has deserved
is here visited with a punishment his own. An entrance is open
to all, an exit to none ; all does that place devour, and to the
Furies consign. Tisiphone, in conjunction with those dreadful
sisters, awards the punishments which they have been found
to deserve to endure. Now to the guilty do I leave Styx, now
Lethe, now Acheron ; once again with much ado do I retrace
my steps to those above.'

" When he had recited this last line, at length returning
to himself, and aroused, as it were, from sleep, he raised
his head, and said to one of the brethren, who, for the pur-
pose of seeing the miracle, had come with the rest, eye-
ing him most intently : ' Wonder not at my features, for die
thou shalt. A grievous and sudden end shall overtake thee.'
After this, turning his eyes upon the assemblage of the bre-
thren, not less elegantly than if he had been gifted from his
infancy with the eloquence of Tully 47 did he foretell in the
Latin tongue certain events which were then to come to pass.
And, as these things afterwards did come to pass, just as he had
foretold, being filled ourselves with the greatest astonishment,
in order that others, as well as ourselves, may admire the lines
which this lay brother composed, who was never in any de-
gree acquainted with letters, we have determined, on account
of the stories there interwoven, to send them from school to
school, in order that, by their judgment, this assertion of ours
may be thoroughly sifted. Some indeed there are, who, in
consequence of the fables inserted, despise the rest ; while some

47 At all events, he may be safely pronounced Tully's equal in demerit
as a poet.



A.D. 1184. PEOPHECY OF PHAfiAHELLA. 43

endeavour to prove (since in many things it has fallen out as
he predicted) that under a kind of veil, these fables bear the
impress of truth ; and, as in no respect it fell out otherwise
than he had predicted, the very same day, gnashing his teeth,
that same brother whose death he had predicted, ended his life
in the greatest agony. Upon this, the brother who had pro-
nounced those prophetic lines, bursting into tears in the pre-
sence of all, was not ashamed to confess, in the contrition of
his heart, whatever during his life he had been guilty of; and,
as befitted a religious man, received the communion with the
greatest devoutness; after receiving which, he immediately
breathed forth his spirit, saying, ' Lord, into thy hands I com-
mend my spirit.' "

Now when the public had heard of these things, and others
of a similar nature, they were greatly alarmed, and the nearer
that pestilential season, which the before-named astrologers
had predicted, drew nigh, the more did exceeding terror
come upon all, both clergy and laity, rich and poor, and drove
great numbers of them to a state of desperation. A certain
writing however, which Pharamella, the son of Abdallah of
Cordova, sent to John, bishop of Toledo, gave them some com-
fort ; it was to the following effect :

" Pharamella, son of Abdallah of Cordova, an Arabian by
parentage, and brought up in the palace of the great king
Evenjacob, who is called ' El Emir Amimoli,' to John, bishop
of Toledo, bishop of those persons who are called Christians,
health, beyond all those who call upon God. They who fear
God, the Creator of all things, shall be exalted, and they also
who adore Him with pure hands and with a heart entirely
cleansed. We have seen some men of your persuasion, dissimilar
to ourselves in dress and in language, who were merchants, and
had very good woollen cloths of various colours on sale. They
stated that they had come from a far distant land, which is called
the ' land of the Elders/ that is to say, the kingdom of the
Franks. Among other matters, we learned from them through
an interpreter, Ferdinand by name, a fellow-citizen of yours,
and at present a captive with us, that certain false astrologers
of the west, who were ignorant of the virtues of the heavenly
bodies 48 and the effects produced by the five wandering ones, 48
and the two lights 49 which move of themselves in epicycles
and eccentric circuits, through their houses and dignities, have

alarmed the hearts of you believers in Christ, and not only
of such as are simple-minded, but even of those among you who
are believed to be wise. For they say that in the year which
is the five hundred and seventy-second of the Alligera, 49 and
the one thousand one hundred and eighty-sixth from the In-
carnation of your Lord Christ, in the month which you call
September, there is to be a very mighty wind, such as is not
often experienced, which shall destroy cities and towns, and
overthrow everything it meets on the earth in its course.
This wind shall come, they say, from the West, and shall
extend even unto the East ; and after the wind a most dreadful
stench, that shall destroy human beings. Of this circum-
stance they allege no further cause than that the planets will
come in conjunction in Libra, which is an aerial sign, and
therefore a cause of windy weather. Now, it may at once be
answered these persons, by even our children, that not only is
Libra an aerial sign, but so also are Gemini and Aquarius aerial
signs ; in both of which, many planets have come in conjunc-
tion, and still no danger of winds or of pestilential exhalations
or of mortality has ensued. But while Saturn and Mars are two
unfortunate stars, Jupiter and Venus are fortunate ones and
propitious ; wherefore, if they shall happen to be in the same
sign with the others, without any setting or attractions, 50 or
shall keep themselves duly balanced, their beneficent effect
will temper the evil effects of the former ones. But on the day
of the month in which they say tha.t this will take place,
Mars will not be in Libra, but in the thirteenth degree of
Yirgo ; while Yenus in Scorpio, which is the house of Mars,
will entirely do away with all the evil influence of Mars, both
as regards his house in which she is reigning, as also in conse-
quence of the respect due to her sex, by means of which she
attracts Mars to feelings of courtesy towards her. Jupiter also,
will assuage the disastrous influence of Saturn, Mercury being
nearer to Jupiter than Saturn. Such persons ought also to re-
collect, that inasmuch as Saturn performs his revolution once
in thirty years, he remains two years and a half in each of the
signs ; 5l whereas Mars accomplishes his course through each

appear doubtful, except to those versed in astrological lore, what is meant
by " Si in eodem signo fuerint cum eis sine respectu, aut applicatione."

of the signs in little less than a year and a half. Since then,
it is a matter of necessity, that in every thirty years Saturn
must always make a stay of about two years and a half in
Libra ; by the same necessity 52 it comes to pass, that before
Saturn goes out of Libra, Mars must be in the same sign of
Libra together with Saturn. If then, Mars and Saturn have
already hitherto been every thirty years once together in Libra,
and are so to be in future, either these pestilential winds have
happened before, or will happen from their evil influence when
in a windy sign, or the converse. But that they have happened
at any previous time, we neither read in the writings of the
masters, nor have we witnessed the fact in our own times. Con-
sequently, we ought to feel assured that they will not happen,
since upon similar combinations it has never fallen out that
any thing of a like nature has happened. Therefore, let your
astrologers peruse the tables of the Inner Persians, and of the
Arabians, Hermes, Astalius, and Abidemonus, as well as of Albu-
masar, of more modern date ; and let them compute proportion-
ally the influences of the stars, their settings, attractions, sepa-
rations, equalities, and other matters which it were tedious
to recount to those even who have time to listen thereto ;
and when they have found that from a like conjunction of
the stars that is false which they are dreaming of, either
let them relinquish opinions based upon such idle stories, or
else be converted to the religion of Ishmael which we pro-
fess. However, according to the judgment of Messehella and
Alkandus, unless God shall ordain it otherwise, there will be a
scanty vintage, crops of wheat of moderate average, much
slaughter by the sword, and many shipwrecks."

In the year of grace 1185, being the thirty-first year of the
reign of king Henry, son of the empress Matilda, that king
was at Windsor in England, on the day of the Nativity of our
Lord. In the same year, on the day of the Circumcision of
our Lord, died Gilbert, the son of Fergus, who had taken his
brother TJchtred, the father of the noble man Roland, and had
caused him to be deprived of his eyes, tongue, and virility, by
his own son Dunecan ; and who had also given up his son the
before-named Dunecan, to the king of England as a hostage to
ensure the preservation of the peace. After his death, Roland,

52 This is the first attempt at reasoning, which has been met with in
all this astrological parade.



46 ANNALS OF SOGEB DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1185.

the son of Uchtred, invaded all the lands of the before-named
Gilbert, and gained possession of them.

In the same year, Baldwin the Leper, king of Jerusalem,
and the Templars and Hospitallers, sent to the king of England,
the son of the empress Matilda, Heraclius, the Patriarch of the
Holy City of Jerusalem, and the grand Masters of the Hospital
and Temple, together with the royal standard, and the keys
of the Sepulchre of our Lord, of the Tower of David, and of
the city of Jerusalem, asking of him speedy succour, as being
the heir and lord of the land of Jerusalem. 53 For it ought to
be known, that Eulk, the brother of Geoffrey, earl of Anjou,
the father of the said Henry, was king of Jerusalem, as we have
previously mentioned. Wherefore, when the before-named Patri-
arch and Master of the Hospital came to England, the king of
England met them at the town of Eeading, and received them
with great joyousness ; on which, immediately falling at the
king's feet, with great weeping and sobbing, they uttered the
words of salutation on behalf of the king, and principal men,
and the whole of the people of the land of Jerusalem, and, ex-
plaining the cause of their coming, delivered to him the royal
standard, and the keys of the Sepulchre of our Lord, and those
of the Tower of David and of the city of Jerusalem, in behalf
of the king and the principal men of the city of Jerusalem,
besides letters from pope Lucius, to the following effect :

The Letter of pope Lucius on giving aid to ike land of Jerusalem.

"Lucius, the bishop, servant of the servants of God, to
Henry, the illustrious king of the English, health and the
Apostolic benediction. Inasmuch as all your predecessors have
been especially distinguished above all the other princes of the
earth for glory in arms and nobleness of spirit, and the people
of the faithful have been taught to look upon them in their
adversity as their defenders ; deservedly is application made to
you, the heir not only of your father's kingdom but of his vir-
tues, a certain degree of security being assured therefrom, at a

15 The true version of the story is, that Baldwin the Leper had recently
died, and his son Baldwin, a child five years of age, had ascended the
throne. Of course these political envoys would not let him stand in the
way of their gaining their object by flattering Henry's ambition. Indeed,
Roger of Wendover distinctly says, that they were despatched for the pur-
pose of offering Henry the throne of Jerusalem.



A.D. 1185. LETTEE OP POPE LUCIUS. 47

time when peril or even extermination is dreaded as impending
over the Christian people ; that by the arm of your royal mighti-
ness, protection may be granted to the members of Him who
has in His mercy allowed you to reach such a height of glory
and pre-eminence, and has rendered you an invincible wall of
defence against those who wished to impugn His name. In the
first place, be it known to your serene highness how that the
land of Jerusalem has been here buffeted by frequent and vex-
atious disputes on these matters, the special inheritance of
Him who was crucified, and the place in which the mysteries
were foretold of our salvation, and brought to a completion by
the carrying out of that event, and of which He who compre-
hended all things in His death, by a peculiar privilege made it
the scene ; and how being now trampled under foot, and hemmed
in by the pressure of a perfidious and most abominable race, it
stands nodding to its downfall ; and how, which God forbid,
the Christian religion must thereby sustain irreparable loss.
For Saladin, the most inhuman persecutor of that holy and
fearful name, has now risen to such a pitch in the spirit of his
fury, and is to such a degree putting forth all the might of his
wickedness for the destruction of the people of the faithful, that,
unless the vehement onset of his wickedness is checked as
though by barriers placed in his path, he may entertain an as-
sured hope and belief that Jordan will flow before his face, and
that the land that was consecrated by the shedding of the vivi-
fying blood, will be polluted by the contact of his most abo-
minable superstitions, and the country which your glorious
and noble predecessors, amid many labours and perils, rescued
from the dominion of the unbelieving heathens, will once more
be subjected to the accursed dominion of this most nefarious
tyrant. In consequence, therefore, of the urgency of the
necessity, and of the sorrows thus imminent, we have deemed
it advisable, by these Apostolic letters, to entreat your mighti-
ness, or rather with a palpitating heart to call upon you with
the loudest voice, showing regard for the honor of Him who
has set you upon high, and, in comparison with the name of
the mighty ones who are on earth, has bestowed upon you a
glorious name, in the earnestness of your pious zeal, to give
your attention to the desolate state of the before-named land,
and, to the end that, in those parts, the confusion of Him may
be put an end to, who, in your behalf, submitted to be held in

derision in that self-same land, to afford efficacious aid. Where-
fore, following in the footsteps of your predecessors, by the aid
of the Lord, let that land be preserved in the worship of the
great God by means of your diligence, which they rescued from
the jaws of the prince of darkness. In such straits of oppression
it befits your highness to labour with the more earnest zeal, in-
asmuch as you are aware that the land is deprived of the pro-
tection of a king, and the powerful men have thought proper to
centre all their hopes of defending it in the protection of your
mightiness. And this your serene highness may be the better
enabled to understand, from the fact that they have despatched
to your excellency the chief men of that land and the mighty
defenders thereof, namely, our venerable brother Heraclius, the
Patriarch, and our dearly beloved son, the Master of the Hos-
pital, that from their dignified presence you may be enabled
to take under consideration the present state of affairs, and to see
how great and extreme is the necessity, on account of which
they have so long endured to be without protection ; to the end
that in person they might the more easily incline your devoted-
ness to comply with their desires. Eeceive, therefore, the per-
sons before-named with all kindness, as though sent to you by
the Lord Himself, treat them in all things with that brotherly
love which is their due, and show yourself ready to acquiesce
in their requests, according as, having regard to their weight
and their probity, you shall think them deserving of your
grace and favour. And further, let your prudence call to mind,
and with anxious meditation thereon ponder over those pro-
mises by which you have so often bound your highness as to
undertaking the protection of the land so often named ; and
show yourself in this respect so wary and so zealous, that, at the
terrible day of judgment your conscience may not accuse you,
and the question put to you by that searching Judge who is
not to be deceived, may not lead to your condemnation."

After hearing these requests, our lord the king made an-
swer that, God willing, all things would yet be well, and ap-
pointed a time for his answer, namely, the first Sunday in Lent,
at London. Accordingly, on this day, 54 our lord the king, the
Patriarch, the bishops, abbats, earls, and barons of the kingdom
of England, "William, king of Scotland, and his brother David,
together with the earls and barons of his kingdom, met at
64 This council was held at Clerkenwell.



A.D. 1 185. A MIRACULOUS EVENT. 49

London, and after a conference had been held thereon with due
deliberation, it pleased all that our lord the king should consult
thereupon Philip, king of France, his liege lord ; upon which
the council breaking up, our lord the king gave to all his subjects,
both clergy and laity, permission to assume the cross. Ac-
cordingly, Baldwin, archbishop of Canterbury, Kanulph, jus-
ticiary of England, Walter, archbishop of Rouen, and Hugh,
bishop of Durham, together with many others of the bishops
from both sides of the sea, and nearly all the earls, barons, and
knights of England, Normandy, Aquitaine, Brittany, Anjou,
Maine, and Touraine, assumed the cross ; at the period of the
assumption of which a certain miraculous event took place.

For on a certain day, a woman who had secretly become
pregnant, finding that the time of her labour was approach-
ing, fled from the house of her father, in consequence of her
wish to avoid being detected in her transgression ; when be-
hold! a mighty tempest of wind and rain overtook her in
her flight, as she was wandering alone in the fields and beg-
ging the Lord for His assistance and a place of refuge. Upon
finding 'that her prayers were not instantly listened to by the
Lord, she fell into a fit of desperation, saying, " If thou, God,
dost despise my prayers, then may the Devil succour me ;"
immediately upon which the Devil made his appearance to her
under the form of a young man, barefoot and girt up as though
for a journey, and said to the woman, " Follow me." As they
passed along the road they met with a sheepfold in a field, on
which the Devil ran before and got ready a fire in the sheep-
fold, and a seat made of fresh straw, upon which the woman
followed him, and, entering the place, warmed herself before
the fire. While so doing, she said, " I am thirsty, and am
quite famished with hunger ;" to which the Devil made answer,
" Wait a little, and I will bring you bread and drink." While
he was gone [to fetch this], two men, who happened to be
passing along the road, seeing a fire in the sheepfold, won-
dered what it could be, and coming nearer, entered the sheep-
fold ; where, finding the pregnant woman lying down near the
fire, they asked her who it was that had made the fire for her,
to which she made answer, " The Devil." On this they en-
quired of her where he was, when she replied, "I was
hungry and thirsty, and he has gone to find me some vic-
tuals and drink." On hearing this, they said to her, " Hava

faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and in the glorious Virgin Mary,
His mother, and they shall deliver you from the hand of the
enemy ; and be sure to enquire of him what shall come to
pass ;" after saying which, they went to a village that was near
at hand, and related to the clergy and the people what they
had seen and heard upon the road.

In the meantime, the Devil returned, and bringing with
him bread and water, refreshed the woman ; after which, stoop-
ing down, she gave birth to a male child, which the Devil
taking up, performed the duties of midwife, and was warm-
ing it before the fire, when, lo ! the priest of the village
before-mentioned came to the sheepfold, armed with the Catho-
lic faith, the cross, and holy water, and attended by the clergy
and a great number of people. Finding that she was delivered,
he was sprinkling the child, which the Devil was holding in
his arms, with holy water, in the name of the holy and un-
divided Trinity, when the Devil, being utterly unable to en-
dure it, took to flight, and, carrying the child away with
him, appeared to them no more. On this, the woman, returning
to herself, exclaimed, " Now do I know of a truth that the
Lord hath delivered me from the hands of the enemy ;" and
she then related to them that she had been informed by the
Devil, that, since the time when Jesus Christ prevailed over
hell, there had not been so great sorrow or lamentation in hell
as there was now, in consequence of the assumption of the
cross : but, said she, his sorrow will be turned into joy, because
so great will be the iniquities and offences of the Crusaders,
that the Lord will blot them out of the Book of Life, and
many of them, forsaking the religion of the cross, will become
persecutors of the cross and of the name of Christ a thing
that afterwards proved to be the case.

Our lord the king next came to Windsor, and there, on the
Lord's day on which is sung 55 "Latare, J&rusalem" [" Eejoice,
Jerusalem,"] which this year fell on the day before the
calends of April, he dubbed his son John a knight, and imme-
diately after sent him to Ireland, appointing him king thereof.
In the meantime, a mighty earthquake was heard 56 throughout
nearly the whole of England, such as had not been heard in that

land since the beginning of the world ; for rocks were split
asunder, houses of stone fell down, and the metropolitan
church of Lincoln was rent from top to bottom. This earth-
quake took place on the day after Palm Sunday, that is to say,
on the seventeenth day before the calends of May ; and on the
day after the said earthquake our lord the king of England,
Heraclius, the Patriarch, and Hugh, bishop of Durham, with
many of the principal men of England, crossed over between
Dover and Witsand. After his arrival in Normandy, our lord the
king of England raised a considerable army, and then sent
word to his son Richard, earl of Poitou, who had fortified
Poitou against him, and had taken prisoner his brother Geof-
frey, earl of Brittany, that unless he delivered up to his mother
Eleanor the whole of Poitou freely and quietly, he would visit
him with a rod of iron, and war against him with all the
power of his might. Upon receiving this command, the said
Richard, ceasing all hostilities, delivered up Poitou to his
mother, and, returning to his father, remained with him like
an obedient son.

In the meantime, on the calends of May, being the day of
the Apostles, Saint Philip and Saint James, about mid-day, a
total eclipse of the sun was seen, which was followed by
thunder and lightning, and a mighty tempest ; from the effects
of which men and animals perished, and many houses, bein^
set on fire thereby, were burned to the ground. After this,
Philip, king of France, and Henry, king of England, holding
a conference as to giving aid to the land of Jerusalem, pro-
mised that they would afford it ample assistance both in men and
money : but, for all this the before-named Patriarch cared
but little, as he had been in hopes that he should be enabled to
bring back with him, for the defence of the land of Jeru-
salem, the before-named king of England, or one of his sons,
or else some other person high in authority ; but, being unable
to effect this, he retired feom the court in sorrow and confusion
on his return to his country.

In the same year, Walter, the archbishop elect of Rouen,
received the pall from pope Lucius, and immediately conse-
crated Gilbert de GlanviUe, who had been presented with the
bishopric of Rochester by the king of England. In this year
also, John, the king's son, coming into Ireland, was honorably
received by John, the archbishop of Dublin, and the other

subjects of his father, who had preceded him ; however, as he
thought fit to shut up everything in his own purse, 56 and
was unwilling to pay their wages to his soldiers, he lost the
greater part of his army in several conflicts with the Irish,
and being at last reduced to want [of troops], after appointing
justices and distributing his knights in various places for the
defence of the country, he returned to England.

In the month of December, in this year, pope Lucius de-
parted this life ; and was succeeded in the papacy by pope
Urban the Third ; who immediately thereupon, in order that
notice thereof might be universally given, wrote to the prelates
of the Holy Church to the following effect :

The Letter of pope Urban on his Election.

" Urban, the bishop, servant of the servants of God, to his
venerable brethren the archbishops and bishops, and to his
dearly beloved sons the abbats, priors, and other prelates of
churches, to whom these letters shall come, health and the
Apostolic benediction. The exalted counsels of heaven, re-
taining in their dispensations a constant supervision thereof,
have founded the Holy Church of Rome, to the governance
whereof, insufficient as we are, we have been chosen, upon a
rock which is based upon the solidity of the faith ; bestowing
upon her that foundation in the strength of the Apostolic con-
fession, that so neither the outbreaks of the storm, nor the
winds of the tempest can prevail against her. Wherefore it is
that the universal Mother Church, ever retaining wit hher the
Saviour, even unto the end of the world, has so, as expressed in
the Song of Solomon, 67 " embraced him whom she loved," that,
by reason of no change of events or of times, can she be separated
from the singleness of her faith, or the fixedness of her affection.
For although, by reason of the repeated changes of her pastors
as they depart, she has frequently fallen into various perils, or
in consequence of the attacks of the wickedness of this world
has endured persecutions and labours innumerable, still, never
has the Divine favour forsaken her, any further than that she
might perfect her strength in some temptation, and thence ob-
tain the joyous fulfilment of her hope, on receiving thereby a
strengthening of her faith. The Lord thus dealing towards her,
within these few days as a mark of His goodness, although no
slight grief and sorrow affected her for the death of the pious

in allusion to ch. vii, 1 0.



A.D. 1185. THE LETTEK OF POPE URBAN. 53

father Lucius, Divine Providence has preserved her in the unity
of the spirit and in the bond of peace, so that after the sorrow
of the evening joy came in the morning, and she, like a most
beauteous dove, rejoicing amid her sighs, retained her beauty
without a ruffle even or a spot upon her whiteness. Now, after
the decease of the father of pious memory, our predecessor
Lucius, our lord the pope, when his most venerable body had
been honorably entombed, there was held by the brethren a con-
ference as to the election of a successor, at which there was such
unity among all, and such concord of each with the other,
that He may be supposed to have wrought upon them, in whose
hands are the hearts of all men, and through whom the diversity
of minds is reconciled. But, while in the church of God, there-
were many venerable and prudent men, of whom it is our belief
that their votes might have more prudently and more worthily
have made choice, inefficient as we are, they turned their eyes
upon us ; and it was done accordingly as it pleased the Lord,
in that they made choice of us as their father and shepherd,
who have neither strength nor merits to suffice to the elevation
of a dignity so great. However, although we were fully con-
scious to ourselves of our own infirmities, so as to believe that
we might, not without good reason, have offered resistance to
their proposals ; still, to the end that through delay in the
transaction or pertinacity in making resistance, no danger might
ensue to the Church, although unwillingly, we consented to
undertake the labour of the burden entrusted to us ; hoping that
our steps would be guided by Him who bestowed on Saint Peter,
when sailing on the waves, faith even to that degree that he
went down into the sea, and went forth to meet Him in the
midst thereof, that doubting he might not perish. Now there-
fore, being placed in such a position and office, as to require
to be aided therein by the suffrages of all the faithful, to you
do we resort, as especial sons of the Roman Church, with
full confidence and security, and, prefacing with the salutation
of the Apostolic benediction, we do by these familiar letters
admonish you, and do earnestly request and exhort you in the
Lord, that, attending the death of our before-named father and
lord Lucius, with the devout suffrages of your prayers, you will
especially pay to ourselves that fidelity and duty which is owed
to us, in virtue of your respect for Saint Peter and Saint Paul
the Apostles and the Apostolic See, by all of you in common,
that by so doing, you may be enabled both to obtain your



54 ANNALS OF EOGEE DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1185,

reward of God, and always be enabled to find more abundant
grace in my eyes, and prove yourselves deserving before the
whole Church. Given at Yerona, on the second day before the
ides of January."

In the same year, Henry, king of England, sent envoys to pope
Urban, and obtained many things of him, which pope Lucius had
stoutly refused ; one of which was that such one of his sons as
he should think fit should be crowned king of Ireland. This
was acceded to by our lord the pope, who confirmed the same by
his bull, and, as a proof of his assent and confirmation thereof,
sent him a crown made of peacock's feathers, embroidered with
gold. In this year, shortly before the feast of Saint Peter ad
Vincula, the before-named Patriarch, having returned to Jeru-
salem, and brought with him no aid for the defence of that land,
great fear came upon the inhabitants of the land of Jerusalem.
Consequently, a certain brother of the Temple, an Englishman
by birth, whose name was Eobert de Saint Alban, having for-
saken the Christian faith, went to Saladin, king of Babylon,
and promised him that he would deliver up to him the city of
Jerusalem ; and, on his giving him security for the same, Sala-
din gave him his niece in marriage, and a considerable body
of troops, and put him in command of his army, making him
general thereof. Upon this, he immediately went forth with
his army to the plains of Saint George, and there divided
it into three detachments, two of which he sent into the parts
adjacent to lay them waste ; on which they ravaged the whole
country, from Montreal to Neapolis, while Jericho, and the city
of Sebaste, with some other cities, were destroyed.

But the before-named Eobert, with the third part of his
army, marched against the city of Jerusalem ; on which the
few inhabitants who were in the city, trusting in the Lord,
went forth by the postern gates, and, carrying before them the
wood of the Cross of our Lord as a standard, by the might of
the Lord smote the army in which was the before -named
Robert; on which, taking to flight, he turned his back on the
smiters, while the men of Jerusalem followed him and his army,
and slew many of them with the edge of the sword : Robert,
however, though with considerable difficulty, made his escape.

After this, on Saladin purposing a fresh attack upon the
land of Jerusalem, the Templars and Hospitallers and other
chief men of that land, gave him sixty thousand besants
for a truce until the octave of the ensuing Easter. In the

meantime, "William de Marchis, earl of Joppa, having died,
William the Leper, the king of Jerusalem, abdicated the throne
of the kingdom, and, naming the boy Baldwin, son of the
before-named William and Sibylla, who was his sister, his
heir, caused him to be crowned long in the Holy City of
Jerusalem; shortly after which he died, on which the boy
Baldwin reigned in his stead for nearly two years, and his
mother Sibylla married Guido de Lusignan, and by him had
two daughters.

In the year of grace 1186, being the thirty-second year of
the reign of king Henry, son of the empress Matilda, the said
king was at Damfront, in Normandy, on the day of the Nati-
vity of our Lord ; after which festival a conference was held
between him and Philip, king of France, at Gisors, where he
made oath that he would give Alice, the sister of the king
of France, in marriage to his son Eichard, earl of Poitou. The
king of France also promised to the before-named Eichard,
together with his said sister, Gisors, and all that his father
Louis had promised, together with his daughter Margaret, to
Henry, the son, the king of England ; and he further made
oath that he would never after that advance any claim against
them in respect thereof.

After having held this conference, the king of England
crossed over to England, and gave to Hugh, prior of the house
of Wicham, which is of the Carthusian order, and in the bishop-
ric of Bath, the bishopric of Lincoln ; whom Baldwin, the arch-
bishop of Canterbury, shortly after consecrated. After this,
the king proceeded with a large army to Carlisle, intending to go
still further to wage war against Eoland, the son of Ucthred, son
of Fergus, for the injuries and spoliations which he had been
guilty of towards Dunecan, the son of Gilbert, son of Fergus ;
but the said Eoland came thither to the king and made peace
with him. The king also, while there, caused Paulinus of Leeds
to be elected to the bishopric of Carlisle ; which, however, the
said Paulinus declined. On this, in order that Paulinus might
be willing to accept of that bishopric, the king offered him to
enrich it with revenues to the amount of three hundred marks
yearly, arising from the church of Bamborough, the church of
Scarborough, the chapelry of Tickhill, and two of the king's
manors near Carlisle.

In the same year, Philip, king of the Franks, gave to Bela,



56 ANNALS OF EOGEE DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1186.

king of Hungary, his sister Hargaret in marriage, who had
been the wife of Henry, the son of the king of England. In
the same year, Geoffrey, earl of Brittany, son of Henry, king of
England, died at Paris from bruises which he had received
from the hoofs of horses at a tournament, and was buried in
the cathedral church of that city. In this year also some of
the Irish cut off the head of Hugh de Lacy in Ireland. In
the same year, our lord the king of England gave Ermengard,
his kinswoman, daughter of Richard, viscount de Beaumont, in
marriage to "William, king of Scotland ; and caused them to
be married in his chapel at Woodstock by Baldwin, archbishop
of Canterbury, where he held in their honor great nuptial
festivities at his palace for a period of four days. Our lord the
king also there presented the king of Scotland with the castle
of Edinburgh ; which the said king immediately gave to the
before-named Ermengard his wife as a marriage portion, and
by way of increasing the same he gave her one hundred pounds
of yearly revenue, and forty knights' fees.

In the same year, while the king of England was staying at
Carlisle, Robert Buteville, dean of the church of York, de-
parted this life, and was succeeded in the deanery by Hubert
Fitz- Walter, clerk to Ranulph de Glanville, at the king's
presentation. In the same year, our lord the king of Eng-
land gave to William de J^orthale the bishopric of Worcester,
and to John, subdean of Salisbury, the bishopric of Exeter ;
who were accordingly consecrated by Baldwin, the archbishop
of Canterbury.

In the same year, after pope Urban, upon the complaint of
John, the bishop of Dunkeld, had heard the dispute that existed
between him and Hugh, the bishop of Saint Andrew's, he wrote
to the king of Scotland to the following effect :

The Letter of pope Urban to William, king of Scotland.

"Urban, the bishop, servant of the servants of God, to
William, the illustrious king of the Scots, health and the
Apostolic benediction. Inasmuch as, by the duties enjoined
upon us by God in virtue of our office, we are bound to give
our earnest attention to all the churches, both those near to

recall them to a more suitable line of conduct, the princes of

this world ought not to feel themselves aggrieved inconsequence
thereof, if sometimes we think proper to extend our hands for the
correction of those things which they have done amiss; inasmuch
as they themselves also, in conformity with the power that has
been entrusted to them, ought to aid us herein, and, when it
is necessary and the obstinacy of any stands in need thereof,
stoutly to resist the contumacy prompted by a spirit of wicked-
ness. Your royal excellency is not unaware what a grie-
vous dissension has arisen between our venerable brethren,
John, bishop of Dunkeld, and Hugh, bishop of Saint Andrew's ;
and although either party has undergone great labours, and
submitted to great expenses, and, in the time of pope Lucius
of blessed memory, our predecessor, held a long discussion
thereon at the Apostolic See, they still were unable to bring
the matter in dispute to a conclusion. And whereas lately
the said bishops came to our presence, and discussed the said
matters at length, in our hearing, upon which, by the advice 01
our brethren, we gave to the before-named bishop of Dunkeld
power to act in the bishopric of Saint Andrew's, in opposition
to the said bishop Hugh, and the said bishop of Saint .Andrew's
was sufficiently instructed in our presence, to return to his own
place within a period named, upon the understanding that
if he should not do so within the said time, our venerable
brother Jocelyn, bishop of Glasgow, and our dearly beloved
sons, the abbats of Melrose, Newbottle, and Dunfermline,
should from thenceforth suspend him from the episcopal
duties, and if he should after that prove contumacious, should
place him under the ban of excommunication, and not revoke
their sentence until such time as he should have come into our
presence. For it is our wish, that this matter should no longer
remain in a state of suspense, in order that thereby the said church
of Saint Andrew's may incur no grave detriment to its interests,
but rather that, the truth being known, with the aid of the Lord,
by our means it may be brought to a suitable conclusion. We
have also ordered the before-named bishop of Glasgow and his
colleagues, relying upon our authority, to extend their protection
to our dearly-beloved sons, Aiulph, dean of Lothian, Odo, the
seneschal, Roger de Feric, and other clerks, friends of the be-
forenamed bishop of Dunkeld, from all molestation whatsoever,
and not to allow their possessions or other goods, or the reve-

nues of the said bishop to be seized upon by any person.
And if any one shall presume to disregard this prohibition
hereon, they are, by means of canonical censure, to restrain them
in such course, no appeal to the contrary withstanding. To
the end, therefore, that what we have ordered may without any
difficulty whatever be complied with, we do advise your royal
excellency, and exhort you in the Lord, and, for the remission of
your sins, enjoin you, out of your love of justice, and your
reverence for Saint Peter and for ourselves, to allow pro-
ceedings to be taken in this matter in conformity with the
tenor of our mandates, and with your royal protection to de-
fend the before-named dean and seneschal, and Eobert de
Fedic, and the rest of the kinsmen and friends of the before-
named bishop of Dunkeld, as also the bishopric, and the rest
of his revenues, and neither in any way to aggrieve them nor
suffer them to be aggrieved by others ; that so this dispute may
without any hindrance be brought to a conclusion, and your
royal mightiness may for this work of justice gain a never-
failing reward from God, and a good name among men. You
are to know also, that we have enjoined the before-named
bishops, in virtue of their obedience to us, not to receive any-
thing from the churches or clergy subject to them in re-
spect of the expenses which, in the transaction of the matters
before-named, they are liable to incur, but to make it their
care to supply the necessary expenses from their own re-
venues alone. For we are unwilling that by their deeds the
churches, or any persons in your kingdom, should incur any
detriment whatever. We also wish it not to escape your
royal excellency, that the before-named bishop of Dunkeld
has so honorably conducted his cause, and has paid such
deference to your kingly dignity, that he has made no propo-
sition whatever, which might by any possibility redound to the
derogation of your royal name, or, by reason of which, your
serene highness ought to feel angered against him. Where-
fore, if anything to the contrary shall be suggested to your
highness by his opponents, you must not lend your royal ear to
the words of such persons. Given at Yerona, on the second
day before the calends of August."



A. D. 1186. LETTER OF POPE TJEBAN. 59



The Letter of the same Pope to John, bishop of Glasgow, and the
alibats, his colleagues, on the same subject.

""Urban, the bishop, servant of the servants of God, to his
venerable brother, Jocelyn, bishop of Glasgow, and his dearly-
beloved sons, the abbats of Melrose, Newbottle, and Dunferm-
line, health and the Apostolic benediction. Inasmuch as, by
the duties enjoined upon us by God in virtue of our office, we
are bound to give our earnest attention to all the churches,
both those near to us as also those at a great distance, and if
we know of any unreasonable attempts made by them, or by
their ministers, to recall them to a more suitable line of con-
duct ; the princes of this world ought not to feel angered in
consequence thereof. Your discreetness is not unaware what a
grievous dissension has arisen between our venerable brethren,
John, bishop of Dunkeld, and Hugh, bishop of Saint Andrew's:
and although either party has undergone great labours and
submitted to great expenses, and, in the time of pope Lucius,
of blessed memory, our predecessor, held a long discussion
thereon at the Apostolic See, they still were unable to bring
the matter in dispute to a conclusion. And whereas lately
the said bishops came to our presence and discussed the said
matters at length in our hearing, upon which, by the advice of
our brethren, we gave to the before-named bishop of Dunkeld
power to act in the bishopric of Saint Andrew's, in oppo-
sition to the said bishop Hugh, and the said bishop of Saint
Andrew's was sufficiently instructed in our presence to re-
turn to his own place within a period named. And to the end
that our most dearly beloved son in Christ, the illustrious king
of the Scots, may not by his power impede the prosecution of
this business, we have warned him by our letters that he is to
allow proceedings to be taken in this business according to the
tenor of our mandate, and to defend with his royal protection
our dearly beloved sons, Aiulph, dean of Lothian, Odo, the sene-
schal, and Robert de Fedic, and the other kinsmen of the above-
named bishop of Dunkeld, and neither to aggrieve them in any
way himself, nor suffer them to be aggrieved by others.
To the end, therefore, that the business before-named may no
longer remain in suspense, and the church of Saint Andrew's



60 ANNALS OP EOGEB DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1186.

thereby incur detriment to its own interests, we do, by these
Apostolic writings, enjoin your discreetness, and do, in virtue
of your obedience, order you, reducing to writing whatever
you shall know of yourselves or through other persons on the
subject of this business, to make it your care to inform us of the
same, sending it to us under the protection of your seals, in
order that we, being instructed by your intimations thereon,
using the advice of our brethren, may proceed in the business
in such manner as it is our duty to do. And if any per-
sons shall with rash daring lay hands upon the before-named
dean, Odo, the seneschal, Robert de Fedic, or any other friends
of the bishop of Dunkeld, and their possessions or other pro-
perty, or the bishopric and other revenues of the said bishop,
then, fully relying on our authorization, you are, by canonical
censure, to restrain them, without any obstacle thereto by way
of appeal. Also, you will, on our behalf, forbid the said
bishops, as we have also done orally, to receive anything what-
ever from the churches or clergy subject to them, in respect of
the expenses which they are liable to incur in the prosecution
of the before-named business ; as they are to supply the ne-
cessary expenses from their own revenues alone. For we are
unwilling that, by their deeds, they should cause detriment to
the Church, or to any other person of your kingdom. Where-
fore, by our authorization, you are strictly to warn the before-
named bishop of Saint Andrew's, that, having received suffi-
cient notice, he is to repair to our presence, within a time
appointed by us for both parties. And if he shall not come,
then you are, all appeal set aside, immediately to suspend him
from 'his episcopal duties. And if even then he shall not
show obedience thereto, you are to place him under the ban of ex-
communication, and not to relax your sentence, until such time
as he shall have presented himself before us. Also, you are to
intimate to his royal excellency that the before-named bishop
of Dunkeld has so honorably conducted his cause, and has paid
such deference to his kingly dignity, that he has made no pro-
position whatever which may by any possibility redound to
the derogation of his royal name, or by reason of which he
ought to feel angered against him. Wherefore, make it your
care, by unceasing exhortations, to persuade him, that if any
thing should be suggested by his opponents to the contrary,

he is not to lend his royal ear to their words. Given at Verona,
on the second day before the calends of August."

On the authority therefore of this letter, Jocelyn, bishop of
Glasgow, and his colleagues, when the time drew nigh which
had been appointed by the Supreme Pontiff for the hearing
of the before-named bishops of Dunkeld and Saint Andrew's,
summoned the before-named bishops a first, second, and third
time to set out upon their journey : on which the bishop of
Dunkeld came, but the bishop of Saint Andrew's, staying
beyond the time, delayed coming, whereupon the above-named
iudges delegate suspended him from the episcopal duties, and
then, in consequence of his contumacy, according to the tenor
of the Apostolic mandate, excommunicated him.

In the same year, Philip, king of France, demanded of
Henry, king of England, the charge of the daughter of Geoffrey,
earl of Brittany, whom at his death he left his heir ; a thing
which the king of England would on no account comply with,
but sent to him Walter, archbishop of Rouen, William de Man-
deville, earl of Aumarle, and Ranulph de Glanville, the justi-
ciary of England, at whose instance the king of Prance made a
truce, and promised to keep the peace until the feast of Saint
Hilary then next ensuing. In the same year, Richard de Yals, a
knight of the king of Prance, fortified a castle in his vill of Vals,
between Gisors and Trie ; on seeing which, Henry de Vere, con-
stableof Gisors, underthe before-named William,earl of Aumarle,
took it amiss, and, wishing to impede the work if he possibly
could, came thither with his people ; on which the men of the
before-named Richard de Yals went out to meet him, and an
engagement taking place, Rader, the son of Richard de Vals, was
slain, and after many men of the said Richard had been wounded,
they took to flight. The saidHenry de Vere, however, not daring
to return to Gisors, went to Richard, earl of Poitou. On this
becoming known to the king of Prance, he ordered that all
who belonged to the territories of the king of England, both
clergy and laymen, who should be found in his dominions,
should be taken in custody, together with all their chattels.
On the other hand, the bailiffs of the king of England, in the
parts beyond sea, did the like as to the subjects of the king of
Prance and their chattels, which were found in their respective
bailiwicks. But shortly after, at the suggestion of his fol-
lowers, the king of Prance gave orders that the subjects of



62 ANNALS OF EOGEK DE SOVEDEX. A.D. 1186.

the king of England should be liberated, and that their chattels
should be restored to them ; on which the bailiffs of the king of
England did the same as to the subjects of the king of France
and their chattels.

In the same year, Constance, the countess of Brittany,
daughter of earl Conan, whom Geoffrey, earl of Brittany, her
husband, had left pregnant at the time of his decease, was
delivered of her eldest son on the holy night of Easter, and
his name was called Arthur. In the same year, Baldwin, the
boy-king of Jerusalem, son of William le Marchis, departed
this life, and was succeeded in the kingdom by his mother
Sibylla, by hereditary right ; but before she was crowned, a
divorce was effected between her and Guido de Lusignan, her
husband, by the Patriarch Heraclius and the Templars and
Hospitallers, who wished her to marry "Walran, earl of Tripolis,
or some nobleman of the principal people of the land of Jeru-
salem ; she, however, by a wonderfol piece of cunning, deceived
them, saying : "If a divorce takes place between me and my
husband, I wish you to make me sure, by your promises and
oaths, that whomsoever I shall make choice of you will Choose
for your head and lord."

Accordingly, after they had so done, they led her into the
Temple, and the before-named Patriarch crowned her ; shortly
after which, when all were offering up their prayers that God
the Lord Almighty would provide a fitting king for that land,
the before-named queen took the royal crown in her hands,
sad placed it on the head of Guido de Lusignan her husband,
saying, " I make choice of thee as king, and as my lord, and
as lord of the land of Jerusalem, for those whom God hath
joined together, let not man put asunder."

At these words all stood in amazement, but on account of
the oath which they had made, no one dared oppose her,
and the Patriarch, approaching, anointed him king ; and then,
Divine service having been celebrated, the Templars escorted
the king and queen to their abode, and provided for them a
sumptuous entertainment. The earl of Tripolis, however, vexed
and sorrowful that the queen had rejected him, went to Saladin,
king of Babylon, and, entering into an alliance with him,
devised many evils for the destruction of the king and queen.
Saladin, however, requested that the truce before-mentioned,
which he had made until the ensuing Easter, should be pro-

longed for the three years next ensuing ; to which proposition
king Guido, by the advice of the Templars, assented, although
it was evident to him that there would shortly come a vast
number of pilgrims, both from England and other kingdoms,
in consequence of the preaching of the Patriarch. Accordingly,
after Easter, there came to Jerusalem an immense multitude
of men-at-arms and other pilgrims ; but as the truce had been
prolonged, very few of them chose to remain. However, Roger
de Mowbray and Hugh de Beauchamp remained there in the
service of God.

In the year of grace 1187, being the thirty- third year of the
reign of king Henry, son of the empress Matilda, that king
was at Guilford, in England, on the day of the Nativity of
our Lord. In the same year, after the Nativity of our Lord,
pope Urban sent to England Octavianus, a cardinal- subdeacon
of the Holy Church of Borne, and with him Hugh de Nunant,
to whom he gave the legateship to Ireland, for the purpose of
there crowning John, the king's son ; but eur lord the king put
off that coronation, and took the before-named legates with him
to Normandy, to a conference to be held between himself and
Philip, king of France. Accordingly, the king of England
crossed over and landed at Witsand, in Flanders, and with him
che legates before-named, and shortly after, a conference was
ield between him and the king of France at Ve Saint Remy,
but they could come to no agreement, in consequence of the ex-
orbitant demands made by the king of France, and parted
without any hopes of peace and reconciliation.

In the same year, after Pentecost, Philip, king of France,
levying a large army, besieged Richard and John, the sons of
the king of England, in Chateau Raoul ; hearing of which, the
king of England came thither with a great army to succour
his sons so besieged. On this, the king of France met him
with his army, and drew up his troops in battle array ; but, by
the mercy of God and the injunction of Urban the Supreme Pon-
tiff, and by the advice of the archbishops, bishops, and other
influential men of both kingdoms, they agreed to a truce for
two years, and that the king of France should hold Yssoudon
and Urse de Fretteval till the end of the truce ; and upon these
terms they desisted from hostilities and returned home.

Alter peace was thus made, Richard, earl of Poitou, remained
with the king of France, though much against the will of



64 ANNALS OP BOGEK DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1187.

his father, and the king of France held him in such high
esteem, that every day they ate at the same table and from
the same dish, and at night had not separate chambers. In
consequence of this strong attachment which seemed to have
arisen between them, the king of England was struck with
great astonishment, and wondered what it could mean, and,
taking precautions for the future, frequently sent messengers
into France for the purpose of recalling his son Richard ; who,
pretending that he was peaceably inclined and ready to come
to his father, made his way to Chinon, and, in spite of the
person wh'o had the custody thereof, carried off the greater
part of his father's treasures, and fortified his castles in Poitou
with the same, refusing to go to his father.

This is supposed to have taken place through the Providence
of God, in order that his father might not be deceived by the
pretended affection of his son, nor be in too great haste to
promote him to the helm of state, in the same way that he
had promoted the other one, 62 who, as already mentioned, had
caused him endless troubles by his unrighteous and vexatious
conduct. At length, however, through the mercy of God, it
came to pass that Richard, earl of Poitou, neglecting the counsels
of the wicked, returned to his father, and once more did homage
to him in presence of a great number of people, both clergy
and laity, and swore fealty to him upon the Holy Evangelists
against all men, and promised that he would not forsake his
counsels. These matters being concluded, the king of England
set out for Brittany, and took the castle of Montrelais by siege,
of which Hervey de Lyons and his brother Guimar had taken
possession after the death of Geoffrey, earl of Brittany.

In the same year, Donald, the son of William, son of Dune-
can, an enemy of William, king of Scotland, and whom the
Scotch called Mac William, was slain in Moray. In the same
year, Isabella, the queen of France, and daughter of the earl of
Hainault, was delivered of her first-born son on the third day
before the nones of September, being the fifth day of the
week, who was named Louis. In the same year, Saladin,
king of Babylon, with an immense multitude of his Turks,
on pretext of the disunion which existed between the king
and the earl of Tripolis, entered the land of Jerusalem ; on
which the brethren of the Temple and of the Hospital went
83 His eldest son, Henry.



A.D. 1187. DEFEAT OF THE CHRISTIANS. 65

forth against him with a great multitude of people, and on an
engagement taking place between them, the army of the Pagans
prevailed against the Christians, on which the latter betook
themselves to flight, and many of them were slain and many
taken prisoners. On the same day also, being the calends of
May, sixty brethren of the Temple, and the Grand Master of
the Hospital, together with sixty brethren of his house, were
slain.

Saladin, on gaining this great victory, attacked and took a
considerable number of the castles, cities, and fortresses of the
Christians; after which, returning to his own country, he
levied a great army, and, by the advice, it is said, of the earl
of Tripolis, who was an enemy to the king, entered the ter-
ritory of Jerusalem, on the Friday after the feast of the Apostles
Saint Peter and Saint Paul, with eight hundred thousand men
or more ; on which he took Tiberias, with the exception of
the keep of the castle, to which place the lady of the castle
had retreated, together with a few knights. On king Guido
being informed of this, by the advice of the earl of Tripolis,
who had lately, with fraudulent intent, entered into a treaty
of peace, the king proceeded one day's march towards Tiberias,
when the earl of Tripolis, who was the leader and guide in
the march, halted the whole army on an elevated and craggy
spot. Being there threatened with an attack of the enemy on
every side, the king, urged by necessity, and compelled by the
advice of his barons, thought proper to engage, and, at their
entreaty,, gave the honor of striking the first blow to the Master
and knights of the Temple.

Upon this, the brotherhood of the Temple, rushing upon
the foe with the bravery of lions, put some to the sword, and
forced others to take to flight. The rest, however, neglecting
the king's commands, did not join the battle, or give them
any succour whatever ; in consequence of which, the knights
of the Temple were hemmed in and slaughtered. After this,
the troops of Saladin surrounded the army of the Christians,
worn out with the fatigues of the march, exhausted by the
intense heat of the climate, and utterly destitute of water, and,
in a great measure, of food as well. At this conjunction, six
of the king's knights, namely, Baldwin de Fortune, Raymond
Buck, and Laodicius de Tiberias, with three companions, being
seized with a diabolical spirit, fled to Saladin, and spontaneously
became Saracens, informing him of every particular as to the

66 ANNALS OF KOOEE BE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1187.

present state, intentions, and resources of the Christians. On
this, Saladin, who before was in anxious doubt as to the result
of the warfare, took courage, and with trumpets sounding,
made an attack with an infinite multitude of warriors on the
Christians, who, in consequence of the rocky and inaccessible
nature of the spot, were unable to fight ; and so, assailing them
with every possible method of attack, he utterly routed the
Christians. At last, Thekedin, the nephew of Saladin, took
Guido, king of Jerusalem, while flying, and the wood of the
Cross of our Lord, after slaying Rufinus, bishop of Acre, who
was carrying it. And this was done through the righteous
judgment of God ; for, contrary to the usage of his predeces-
sors, having greater faith in worldly arms than in heavenly
ones, he went forth to battle equipped in a coat of mail, and
shortly after he perished, being pierced by an arrow. Nearly
all the others, being utterly routed, were taken prisoners and
either slain or loaded with chains, the Persians, oh, great dis-
grace ! remaining masters of the camp.

The earl of Tripolis alone, who was the designer of this
treachery, escaped with his men unhurt. Immediately after
the battle, Saladin ordered the knights of the Temple and of
the Hospital to be separated from the rest, and to be decapi-
tated in his presence, he himself with his own hand slaying
"Raymond de Castiglione, their chief. After this he took the
city of Acre and the places adjacent, with nearly all the forti-
fied spots in those parts.

In the meantime, Conrad le Marchis, brother of the above-
mentioned William, earl of Joppa, having been guilty of mur-
der in the city of Constantinople, took to flight, deserting his
wife, the niece of Isaac, emperor of Constantinople ; and on
the very same day on which Saladin gained this victory over
the Christians, Conrad came to Tyre and found it deserted,
for nearly all the citizens of the place were slain in the before-
mentioned battle. On Saladin coming thither, expecting to have
free ingress, Conrad offered a stout resistance, and refused him
permission to enter ; on which, Saladin, seeing that he could
effect nothing by staying there, took his departure, and cap-
tured the city of Beyrout, and both the cities which are called
Gibelet, with Sidon, and the city of Cassarea, as also Joppa,
Saint George, Saint Abraham, Bethlehem, the New Castle of
Caiaphas, Saphet, Jaunay, Mount Tabor, Eaba, and Caffar-
nmndel, the Cave of the Temple, Calenzun, Marie of the



A.D.1187. DEATH OF POPE URBAN. 67

Temple, the Castle on the Plain, Raman, Bethurun of the
Knights, Castle Arnald, Castle Bourgoing, Tarentum, Blanche-
warde, Galatia, Gasseres, Damn, 63 Rouge Cisterne, the Castle
of Saint Peter, Saint Lazarus of Bethany, Saint Mary of Mount
Sion, and the City of Jerusalem.

On this, the queen, the wife of Guido, betook herself, with
her two daughters and her household, to the city of Ascalon,
and fortified it with provisions and soldiers ; these, however,
in the second year after, she surrendered to Saladin for the
ransom of her husband Guido, and thus liberated him from
the custody of Saladin. All those, however, who had fled to
Acre, and a multitude of Christians who had taken to flight,
betook themselves to Tyre, and made Conrad their ruler and
protector ; Antioch also, and Margat, with nearly all the lands of
the prince thereof, stoutly fortified themselves against Saladin.

While the earl of Tripolis was endeavouring to wean his
nation from the worship of God, and to betray his country to
Saladin, he was found dead in his bed just as though fast asleep ;
on which his wife, with all her people, surrendered herself
and the city of Tripolis to Raymond, prince of Antioch, and
he appointed his son Jocelyn lord thereof.

Now when pope Urban heard that in his time the king of
Jerusalem had been taken prisoner, as also the Cross of our Lord,
and the Holy City of Jerusalem, he was greatly afflicted, and
fell ill, and died on the thirteenth day before the calends of
November, at Ferrara ; being succeeded in the papacy by Albert
his chancellor, who was called pope Gregory the Eighth. On
this, the cardinals, with the sanction of our lord the pope,
strictly pledged themselves to each other, disregarding all
wealth and luxuries, to preach the cross of Christ, and that
not in word only but by deed and example, and to be the first,
assuming the cross, to go begging for succours, and to precede
the rest to the land of Jerusalem. They also, with the con-
sent of our lord the pope, established a most strict truce between
all the princes of Christendom, to last for a period of seven
years ; on the understanding that whoever in the meantime
should commence war against a Christian, should be subject
to the curse of God, and of our lord the pope, and the excom-
munication of all the prelates of the Universal Church. They
also solemnly promised each other, that from thenceforth they
would receive presents from no one who had a cause to try

in the court, but would only receive as much as should be given,
or sent to supply their necessities and for their sustenance ;
as also that they would not mount a horse so long as the land
on which the feet of the Lord had stood should remain under
the feet of the enemy.

It is also worthy of observation, and to be ascribed to the
Divine Providence, that at the time when the city of Jerusalem
and Antioch had been rescued from the power of the Pagans,
on the expedition headed by Audemar, bishop of Puy, and many
other bishops and religious men, as also Hugh, brother of Philip,
king of France, Godfrey, duke of Lorraine, Stephen, count of
Chartres, Robert, duke of Normandy, brother of William the
Second, the king of England, then reigning, (which Robert
conquered in battle, Colbrand, the chief of the knighthood of
the Pagans), Robert, earl of Flanders, Eustace, earl of Bou-
logne, and Baldwin, the two brothers of duke Godfrey, Ray-
mond, earl of Saint Gilles, Boamund, son of Robert Guiscard,
and many other noblemen, the pope who was then living was
named Urban, the Patriarch of Jerusalem was called Heraclius,
and the emperor of Rome was called Frederic ; and so now,
when the land of Jerusalem was taken from the hands of the
Christians by the people of Saladin, the pope was called Urban,
the patriarch of Jerusalem Heraclius, and the Roman emperor
Frederic. It also deserves to be known, that between the time
when Jerusalem was rescued from the hands of the Pagans by
the warriors before-named, and the time when king Guido was
deprived of it, a space of eighty-seven years intervened.

The Letter of Terricms, Master of the Temple, on the capture of
the land of Jerusalem.

" The brother Terricius, so called Grand Master of the most
impoverished house of the Temple, and of all the brethren him-
self the most impoverished, and that brotherhood all but anni-
hilated, to all commanders and brethren of the Temple to whom
these presents shall come, greeting, and may they lift up their
sighs to Him at whom the sun and moon are astounded. "With
how many and how great calamities, our sins so requiring it,
the anger of God has lately permitted us to be scourged, we are
unable, sad fate ! either in writing or in the language of tears
to express. For the Turks, assembling together an immense
multitude of their nations, began with bitter hostility to invade
the territories of us Christians ; and accordingly, uniting the



A.D. 1137. LETTEB OF THE GRAND MASTEE TERBICIUS. 69

forces of our nation against them, we ventured, before the oc-
tave of the Apostles Saint Peter and Saint Paul, to attack
them ; and for that purpose ventured to direct our march to-
wards Tiberias, which, leaving their camp unprotected, they
had taken by storm. After repulsing us among some most
dangerous rocks, they attacked us with such vehemence, that
after they had captured the Holy Cross and our king, and
a whole multitude of us had been slain, and after two hundred
and thirty of our brethren, as we verily believe, had been
taken by them and beheaded, (besides those sixty who had
been slain on the first of May), with great difficulty, the lord
the earl of Tripolis, the lord Keginald of Sidon, the lord Bal-
lovius, and ourselves, were enabled to make our escape from
that dreadful field. After this, the Pagans, revelling in the
blood of us Christians, did not delay to press on with all their
hosts towards the city of Tyre ; and, taking it by storm, spread
themselves over nearly the whole of the land, Jerusalem, Tyre,
Ascalon, and Berytus being alone now left to us and to Chris-
tendom. These cities also, as nearly all the citizens have been
slain, we shall not be at all able to retain in our hands, unless
we speedily receive the Divine assistance, and aid from your-
selves. For at the present moment they are besieging Tyre with
all their might, and cease not to assault it either night or day,
while so vast are their numbers, that they have covered the whole
face of the land from Tyre, as far as Jerusalem and Gaza, just
like swarms of ants. Deign, therefore, with all possible speed,
to bring succour to ourselves and to Christianity, all but ruined
in the East, that so through the aid of God and the exalted
merits of your brotherhood, supported by your assistance, we
may be enabled to save the remainder of those cities. Farewell."

In the same battle in which Guido, king of Jerusalem, was
made prisoner, Roger de Mowbray was also taken ; whom in
the following year the brethren of the Hospital and the Temple
ransomed from the hands of the Pagans ; shortly after which he
died. In the same battle also, Hugh de Beauchamp was slain.

In the same year, the king of England gave Constance,
countess of Brittany, the mother of Arthur, in marriage to
Ranulph, earl of Chester. In this year also, Baldwin, arch-
bishop of Canterbury, erected new buildings and a church 64
near the walls of the city of Canterbury, and assigned thereto
prebends in the churches of the monks at Canterbury ; but

the said monks complaining in consequence thereof, pope Urban
forbade that this should be done, and thus the persons who
had built the place expended their labour in vain. However,
the said archbishop transferred this building to Lamhe, 64 * 4 which
is on the other side of the Thames, opposite to Westminster.
In the same year, Richard, earl of Poitou, assumed the cross
of the pilgrimage to Jerusalem.

The Letter of pope Gregory tlie Eighth to all the faithful in
Christ.

" Gregory, the bishop, servant of the servants of God, to all
the faithful in Christ, to whom these presents shall come,
health and the Apostolic benediction. On hearing of the
severity of the tremendous judgment which the hand of God
has inflicted upon the land of Jerusalem, both we and our
brethren have been put to confusion with terror so extreme, and
afflicted with sorrows so great, that it did not readily suggest itself
to us what we were to do, or what indeed we ought to do. We
only called to mind the words of the Psalmist, where he laments
and says, 65 ' God, the heathen are come into thine inheritance :
thy holy temple have they defiled, they have laid Jerusalem
in heaps. 66 The dead bodies of thy servants have they given
to be meat unto the fowls of the heaven, the flesh of thy saints
unto the beasts of the earth.' For, taking advantage of the
dissensions, which, through the wickedness of men, at the sug-
gestion of the Devil, had arisen throughout the earth, Saladin
came with a multitude of troops to those parts, and, being met
by the king, the bishops, Templars, Hospitallers, earls, and
barons, with the people of the land, together with the Cross
of our Lord (through which, by the remembrance of Christ
and faith in Him who hung therefrom and redeemed man-
kind, there used formerly to be assured protection, and a de-
fence now vainly regretted against the assaults of the Pagans)
part of our people were there slain, the Cross of our Lord
was captured, the bishops slaughtered, the king made prisoner,
and nearly all either slaughtered with the sword or taken by
the hands of the enemy, so much so, that it is said that but very
few escaped. The Templars also, and Hospitallers, were be-
headed in his presence. How, after they had vanquished our
army, they subsequently attacked and gained possession of all

quarters, so that only a few places are said to be remaining
which have not fallen into their hands, we do not think requires
to be set forth in our letters. However, although we may
now say with the Prophet, i Oh that my head were waters, and
mine eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep night and
day for the slain of my people ;' 67 still, we ought not to be so ut-
terly cast down as to fall into distrustfulness, and to believe that
God is so angered with His people, that what in His wrath He
has allowed to be done through the multitude of our sins in
common, He will not speedily, when appeased by our repent-
ance, in His compassion alleviate, and will, after our tears and
lamentation, cause gladness and rejoicing. Whatever person
then, amid such vast grounds for lamentation, does not, if not in
body, still in heart, condole with us, is not only forgetful of
the Christian faith, which teaches us to grieve with all who
grieve, but even of his own self and of our common humanity,
as every person of ordinary discretion is able well to esti-
mate both the very magnitude of the danger, the fierceness of
the barbarians who thirst for Christian blood, and exert the
whole of their might in profaning the holy places, and using
their endeavours to sweep away the name of God from off the
earth, points on which we will not enlarge. And whereas
the Prophets first laboured with all their zeal, and after them
the Apostles and their followers, that the worship of God might
exist in that land, and flow thence unto all regions of the
world, aye, and even more than that, God (who was willing to
become flesh, by whom all things were made, and who in his in-
effable wisdom and his incomprehensible mercy was willing thus
to work out our salvation, through the infirmity of the flesh,
through hunger, fasting, thirst, the cross, and His death and
resurrection, according to the words, ' Of himself he wrought
out our salvation in the midst of the earth ;') also deigned here
to undergo labours as well, neither tongue can tell, nor sense can
imagine what grief it causes to us and to all Christian people
to think what this land has now endured, and what under its
former people it is read of as having suffered. Still, we ought
not to believe that it is through the injustice of the judge who
smites, but rather through the iniquity of the sinful people that
these things have come to pass ; since we read that when the
people turned unto the Lord, one thousand pursued, and twelve
thousand fled; nay more, that, while the people slept, the army

72 A1TOA18 OP EOGER DE HOVEDEN". A.D. 1187-

of Sennacherib was cut off by the hand of the angel of the Lord.
Still, however, that land devoured its inhabitants, and was never
able to remain in a state of quietude, or to retain its people, as
being transgressors of the laws of God ; thus giving a lesson and
an example to those who are aiming at gaining a heavenly Jeru-
salem, that they cannot possibly attain the same but by the
exercise of good works and through many temptations. These
events, in fact, might have been already apprehended when
Arroaise and other lands passed into the hands of the Pagans,
and proper prudence would only have been used if the people
who survived had returned to repentance, and by their con-
version appeased God, whom by their transgressions they had
offended. Nor yet did His wrath come suddenly upon them,
but He delayed His vengeance and gave time for repentance.
At last, however, He who loses not justice in mercy, has exer-
cised His vengeance in the punishment of the transgressors, and
in thus giving a warning to those who wished to be saved.
Moreover, we, who amid such great sorrow for that land, ought
to give our attention not only to the sins of the inhabitants
thereof, but also to our own and to those of the whole people, and
to be in dread lest what still remains to us of that land may be
lost, and their might may rage to the detriment of other nations
as well, as we hear in all parts of dissensions and offences be-
tween kings and princes, cities and cities, may well mourn
with the Prophet and say : ' There is no truth nor know-
ledge of God in the land. By lying, and killing, and

committing adultery, they break out, and blood toucheth
blood.' 68 Wherefore this is imperative upon all, and is to be
thought upon and to be done ; making atonement for our
sins by a voluntary chastisement, we ought, through repent-
ance and works of piety, to turn to the Lord our God, and first
to amend in ourselves those matters in which we have done
amiss, and then to stand prepared for the fierceness and malice
of our enemies, and those attacks which they do not fear to
make upon God, inasmuch as we ought on no account to
hesitate to act in the cause of God. Think, therefore, my
sons, how you have come into this world, and how you are to
depart therefrom, how transitory are all things, and how tran-
sitory are you yourselves as well; and with thanksgiving receive,
so far as in you lies, this opportunity for repenting and doing
good, and both offer your possessions, and offer yourselves
Hos. iv. 1, 2.



A.D. 1187. LETTER OF POPE GKEGOBY. 73

as well, because you are not of yourselves, nor have you any-
thing of yourselves, who are not able to make so much as a
single fly upon the earth. And we do not say, ' leave behind
you,' but rather ' present beforehand' to the garner of heaven
what you possess, and lay it up with Him, with whom t neither
rust nor moth destroy, nor thieves break through and steal,'
labouring for the recovery of that land in which for our salva-
tion the Truth of the earth was born, and did not disdain for
us to bear the cross. And devote not your thoughts to lucre
or to temporal glory, but to the will of God, who in His
own case has taught you to lay down your lives for your bre-
thren, and give unto Him your riches, which, whether wil-
lingly or unwillingly, you know not to what heirs you are at
last to leave. For indeed it is no new thing that that land
is chastised, nor in fact is it unusual that scourgings and chas-
tisements should accompany mercifulness. God indeed by His
will alone can save it ; but still, we have no right to ask him
why He has acted thus : for perhaps He has wished to make trial,
and to place this before the notice, of others, if any there are
who are of good understanding or who seek for God, and who will
with joy embrace the opportunity offered them for repentance,
and, laying down their lives for their brethren, will compress
and include the deeds of a long life in a small compass. Con-
sider how the Maccabees, influenced with zeal for the Divine
law, submitted to every extremity of peril for the purpose of
liberating their brethren, and showed how that, for the safety
of their brethren not only their substance but also their lives
were to be laid down, exhorting one another, and saying,

' Arm yourselves, and be valiant men For it is better to

die in battle than to behold the calamities of our people and
of our sanctuary.' 69 And yet these were under the control of
the law only, whereas you, through the Incarnation of our
Lord Jesus Christ, being led by the light of truth, and being in-
structed by many examples of the Saints, ought to act without
any hesitation, and not to fear to give your earthly things, few
in number, and destined to last for a short time only ; you to
whom those good things have been promised and reserved, which
' Neither eye hath seen nor ear heard, neither have entered
into the heart of man;' 70 and as to which the Apostle says,
' The sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be com-
pared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.' 71 Where-

fore, to those who with a contrite heart and humble spirit
shall undertake the labour of this expedition, and shall die in re-
pentance for their sins and in the true faith, we do promise ple-
nary indulgence for their offences, and eternal life. And whether
they shall survive or whether die, they are to know that they
will have, by the mercy of Almighty God and of the authority
of the Apostles Saint Peter and Saint Paul, and of our-
selves, remission of penance imposed for all sins of which they
shall have made due confession. The property also of such
persons, from the time that they shall have assumed the cross,
together with their families, are to be under the protection of
the Holy Church of Rome, and of the archbishops, bishops,
and other prelates of the Church of God, and no person is to make
any claim against the property of which, on assuming the cross,
they were in quiet possession, until it is known for certain as to
their return or death, but their property is to remain in the
meantime untouched, and in their quiet possession ; they are
also not to pay interest to any person, if they have so bound
themselves ; nor yet are they to go in costly apparel,. or with
dogs or hawks, which seem rather to minister to ostentation
and luxury than to our necessities ; but they ought to be seen
with plain apparel and equipments, by which they may appear
rather to be acting in penitence than affecting an empty pomp.
Given at Ferrara, on the fourth day before the calends of No-
vember, in the sixth year of the indiction."

The Letter of pope Gregory the Eighth to all the faithful, upon
the same subject.

" Gregory, the bishop, servant of the servants of God, to all
the faithful in Christ, to whom these presents shall come,
health and the Apostolic benediction. Never is the wrath of
the Supreme Judge more successfully appeased, than when, at
His command, carnal desires are extinguished within us.
Wherefore, inasmuch as we do not doubt that the disasters
of the land of Jerusalem, which have lately happened through
the irruption of the Saracens, have been expressly caused by
the sins of the inhabitants of the land and of the whole people of
Christendom, we, by the common consent of our brethren, and
with the approval of many of the bishops, have enacted that
all persons shall, for the next five years, on every sixth day
of the week, at 'the very least, fast upon Lenten fare, and that,
wherever mass is performed, it shall be chaunted at the ninth

hour : and this we order to be observed from the Advent of our
Lord until the Nativity of our Lord. Also, on the fourth day
of the week, and on Saturdays, all persons without distinction,
who are in good health are, to abstain from eating flesh. We
and our brethren do also forbid to ourselves and to our house-
holds the use of flesh on the second day of the week as well,
unless it shall so happen that illness or some great calamity or
other evident cause shall seem to prevent the same ; trusting
that by so doing God will pardon us and leave His blessing
behind Him. 72 This therefore we do enact to be observed,
and whosoever shall be guilty of transgressing the same, is
to be considered as a breaker of the fast in Lent. Given at
Ferrara, on the fourth day before the calends of November."

Upon this, the princes of the earth, hearing the mandates
and exhortations of the Supreme Pontiff, exerted themselves
with all their might for the liberation of the land of Jerusalem ;
and accordingly, Frederic, the emperor of the Romans, and
the archbishops, bishops, dukes, earls, and barons of his em-
pire, assumed the sign of the cross. In like manner, after
their example, great numbers of the chief men of all the
nations of Christendom prepared to succour the land of Jeru-
salem.

There was a certain clerk named master Bcrther, a native of
Orleans, who aroused the spirits of many to assume the cross
by repeating the following lines : 73 "In the strains of Jere-
miah the ways of Sion mourn indeed, that no longer is there
one upon the solemn day to visit the Holy Sepulchre, or to
recall the fulfilment of that prophecy ; the prophecy in which
the poet writes that from Sion the law shall go forth. Never
shall the law perish there or have an avenger, 74 where Christ
drank of the cup of passion. The wood of the cross, the banner

72 Sic in original. Probably the real presence in the Eucharist is re-
ferred to.

73 This Leonine dirge begins as follows :

" Juxta threnos Jeremiae
Vere Sion lugent viae ;
Quod solemni non sit die
Qui sepulchrum visitet,
Vel casum resuscitet
Hujus prophetiae."

The enthusiasm of the composer seems to have considered a meaning
as comparatively unnecessary in his lines.

74 The meaning of these lines is involved in obscurity.

of the chieftain, the army follows, which has never given way,
but has gone before in the strength of the Holy Spirit. To bear
the burden of Tyre it is now the duty of valiant men to try their
strength, and daily to contend ; spontaneously to be graced
with the glories of the warfare. But as to the persons who are
about to engage in this conflict, there is need of hardy cham-
pions, not effeminate epicures. For it is not those who pamper
their flesh with many luxuries who purchase God with their
prayers. The wood of the cross, &c. \_as lefore.~\ r Fresh
Philistines once more, the cross captured of Him who was con-
demned, have taken the ark of God, the ark of the New Tes-
tament, the substance of the ancient type, in succession the
type of the substance. But as it is clear that these are the
forerunners of Antichrist, to whom Christ would have resist-
ance made, what answer at the coming of Christ is he to
make who shall not have resisted them ? The wood of the
cross, &c. The despiser of the cross is trampling on the cross,
whence overwhelmed the faith sends forth groans. Who for
vengeance does not shout aloud ? At the same value which
each man sets upon the faith let him ransom the cross, if by
the cross any one has been ransomed. Those who have but
little silver, if found to be faithful, with pure faith let them
be content. Sufficient provision for the journey is the body
of the Lord for him who defends the cross. The wood of the
cross, &c. Christ, on delivering himself to the torturer, has made
a loan to the sinner ; if then, sinner, thou wilt not die for Him
who died for thee, thou dost but poorly pay the debt to thy
Creator. Well may he be indignant to whom thou dost refuse
to bend, while, tortured in the wine-press of the cross as a
victim for thee, to thee he extends his arms, and thou wilt not
receive his embrace. The wood of the cross, &c. When thou
hast listened to what is my request, take up thy cross and
make thy vow and say, ' To Him do I commend myself, who
gave His body and His life, as a victim to die for me.' The

albeit our merits are but deficient, has willed that we should be
one of them, we are bound and are willing to use all due care,
that no person through fortuitous circumstances, in conse-
quence of a visit to the Church of Rome, should be deprived
of the due results of the labour which he has expended in coming
to us. Wherefore, it has come to pass, that we, wishing to
have due regard for the expense which many have incurred, and
to alleviate their labours, have, in conformity with the custom-
ary clemency of the Apostolic See, thought fit to enact that
the letters of our predecessor pope Urban, sent at any time pre-
vious to three months before his decease, for the purpose of
pronouncing judgment and putting an end to litigation, (sup-
posing always that they do not contain anything to the mani-
fest prejudice of any person, or any breach of equity), shall have
the same effect in the time of our administration, which they
would have had if he had been still living. Wherefore, waiving
all exceptions as to the death of him who so directs, do what
he has directed to be done, and let no one for an excuse of
this sort, be compelled to have recourse to us in his disappoint-
ment, after having placed full confidence in obtaining justice by
these means. Given at Ferrara, on the sixth day before the
calends of September."

In the same year died pope Gregory the Eighth, in the
month of December, after having held the papacy hardly two
months, and was buried at Pisa. He was succeeded by Pau-
linus, bishop of Palestrina, who was called pope Clement the
Third. In the same year, nearly the whole of the city of Chi-
chester was burnt, together with the cathedral of the see, and
the houses of the bishop and canons.

In the same year, Saladin laid siege to Jerusalem, and
offered the people of that city a truce till the middle of the
month of May, if they would permit him to plant his standard
in the Tower of David, and remain there eight days. This
being accordingly done, many of the Christians who had before
stoutly resisted the Saracens, surrendered their castles and
houses to Saladin. In the same year died Gilbert, bishop of
London.

In the same year, cardinal Jacinto, at this time legate of the
whole of Spain, degraded many abbats, either because they de-
served it, or prompted by his own determination. But on his
attempting to degrade the bishop of Coimbra, Alphonso, king of
Portugal, would not allow that bishop to be degraded, but im-

mediately ordered the before- named cardinal to leave his king"
dom, or else he would cut off his foot. On hearing this, the
legate departed on his return to Some, and the bishop of Coim-
bra remained in peace in his see.

It is also worthy to be known, that the before-named Al-
phonso, king of Portugal, took from the Pagans by force, and
with mighty prowess, six cities, namely, Lisbon, Coimbra, the
city of Ferenza, and a most excellent castle, which is called
Santa Herena, 27 with many other castles besides. But while
he was besieging the city of Silves, and had gained possession
of it as far as the fortresses of the city, the Pagans who were
in the fortresses made an arrangement with him, that if they
should not have succours within six days, they would surren-
der the forts to him. In the meantime, on the third day,
having given his army leave to make a sally into the adjacent
parts of the province, while he was asleep in his tent as being
in perfect security, Ferdinand, king of Saint Jago, (who had mar-
ried the daughter of the said king of Portugal) came in one
direction with a large army, while the Saracens came in the
other. At the approach of these, the king of Portugal, awaking
from his sleep, fled on a swift horse, but, when going through
the gate of the city, broke his thigh against the bar of the
gate, and then, having passed right through the enemy, who
pursued him twenty-five miles, and could not overtake him,
he and his horse fell into a deep pit. Some shepherds, seeing
this, dragged him out, and gave him up to king Ferdinand,
to whom he gave for his ransom twenty-five towns which
he had taken from him, besides fifteen sumpter horses laden
with gold, and twenty chargers ; to other persons, also, who
gave assistance to that king, that he might be the more speedily
liberated, he made numerous presents.

In the year of grace 1188, being the thirty-fourth year of

the reign of king Henry, son of the empress Matilda, the said

king was at Caen in Normandy, on the day of the Nativity

of our Lord ; going from which place, he went to Harfleur,

with the intention of crossing over to England. On hearing of

this, Philip, king of Francejevied a great army, shamelessly

boasting that he wouldlaywHste Normandy and the other

( lands of the king of England beyond sea, unless he should

\ surrender to him Gisors with its appurtenances, or make his

\\ son Eichard, earl of Poitou, many his sister Alice.

A.D. 1138. SUBSIDY FOR THE LAND OF JERUSALEM. 79

The king of England, on hearing of this, returned into Nor-
mandy, and a conference being held between him and the king
of France, between Gisors and Trie, on the twelfth day be-
fore the calends of February, being the day of Saint Agnes the
Virgirr-attd Martyr, they met there, together with the arch-
bishops, bishops, earls and barons of their kingdoms. At this
interview, the archbishop of Trie was present, who, filled with

friends on that same day, and from his hands received the cross ;
while at the same hour there appeared the sign of the cross
above them in the heavens ; on beholding which miracle multi-
tudes of persons rushed in whole troops to assume the cross.

The kings before-named, on assuming the cross, for the pur-
pose of-^fecognizing their various nations, adopted distin-
guishing signs for themselves and their people. For the king
of France and his people wore red crosses ; the king of England
with his people white crosses ; while Philip, earl of Flanders,
with his people, wore green crosses. After this, they departed,
each to his own country, for the purpose of providing all neces-
saries for themselves and the expedition. Accordingly, Henry
king of England, after he had thus assumed the cross, came to
Le Mans, where, on his arrival, he gave orders that every one
should give a tenth part of his revenues in the present year,
and of his chattels, by way of alms, as a subsidy to the land
of Jerusalem, the following articles being excepted therefrom :
the arms, horses, and garments of men-at-arms, and the horses,
books, clothes, vestments, and all kinds of sacred vessels be-
longing to the clergy, as also all precious stones belonging to
either the clergy or laity ; excommunication having been first
pronounced by the archbishops, bishops, and rural deans, 78 in
each parish against every one who should not lawfully pay
his before-mentioned tithe in the presence and at the assessment
of those whose duty it was to be present thereat.

Further, the said money was to be collected in each parish
in the presence of the priest of the parish, the rural dean, one
Templar, one Hospitaller, one member of the household of our

lord the king, a clerk of the king, and a yeoman of the baron's
household, his clerk, and the clerk of the bishop ; and if any
one should give less, according to their conscientious assessment,
than he ought, four or six lawful men of the parish were to
be chosen, who, on oath, were to state the amount that he
ought to have stated, on which he would be bound to add the
amount by which it was deficient. Clerks, however, and knights
who should assume the cross, were not to pay any such tithes ;
but the revenues from their demesnes, and whatever their vas-
sals should owe as their due, were to be collected by the above-
named persons, and to be remitted to them untouched.

The bishops, also, were by their letters in each parish of
their respective dioceses, to cause notice to be given on the
day of the Nativity, of Saint Stephen, and of Saint John, that
each person was to collect the before- mentioned tithe due from
him by the day of the Purification of the Virgin Mary, and, on
the day after the same, was lawfully to pay it to those present of
the persons named, at such place as should be appointed.

In addition to this, it was decreed by our lord the pope,
that whatever clerk or layman should assume the cross, he
should, on the authority of God and of the holy Apostles,
Saint Peter and Saint Paul, be free and absolved from all sins
as to which he should have repented and made confession. It
was also enacted by the kings, archbishops, bishops, and other
princes of the land, that all those persons, both clerks and lay-
men, who should not go on this expedition, should pay tithes of
their revenues and moveables for the present year, and of all
their chattels, both in gold and silver, and of all other things,
with the exception of the garments, books, and vestments of
the clerks and priests, and with the exception of the horses,
arms, and clothing of men at arms, pertaining to the use ot
their own persons. It was also enacted that all clerks, knights,
and yeomen who should undertake the said expedition, should
have the tenths of their lands and of their vassals, and should
pay nothing for themselves. Burgesses, however, and villeins,
who, without the permission of their superior lords, should
assume the cross, were still to pay tithes.

It was also enacted that no one should swear profanely, and

that no one should play at games of chance or at dice ; and no

one was after the ensuing Easter to wear beaver, or gris, 79

or sable, or scarlet; and all were to be content with two

dishes.^ JSTo one was to take any woman with him on the
pilgrimage, unless, perhaps, some laundress to accompany him
on foot, about whom no suspicion could be entertained ; and
no person was to have his clothes in rags or torn. It was also
enacted that whatever clerk or layman should, before assuming
the cross, have mortgaged his revenues, he was to have the in-
come of the present year in full, and after the expiration of
the year the creditor was again to have the revenues thereof,
upon the understanding, however, that the revenues which he
should then receive should be reckoned towards payment of the
debt, and that the debt, from the period of the debtor assuming
the cross, should not bear interest, so long as the debtor should
be absent on the pilgrimage.

It was also enacted that all clerks and laymen who should
set out on the said pilgrimage, should be at liberty legally
to mortgage their incomes, whether ecclesiastical, or lay, or
otherwise, from the Easter, when they should set out, for a
period of three years, upon the understanding that the cre-
ditors should, in whatever case they should be due to the
creditors, take in full, for three years from the Easter before-
mentioned, all the profits of the revenues which they should so
hold in mortgage. It was also enacted that whoever should
die on the pilgrimage, should leave his money which he must
have taken with him on the pilgrimage, to be divided for the
maintenance of his servants, for the assistance of the land of
Jerusalem, and for the sustenance of the poor, according to the
judgment of certain discreet men, who were to be appointed
for the performance of that duty.

All the above-mentioned statutes were framed and enacted
at Le Mans, by Henry, king of England, in presence of his
son Eichard, earl of Poitou, "William, archbishop of Tours,
Baldwin, archbishop of Canterbury, Walter, archbishop of
Rouen, and in presence of John, bishop of Evreux, Ealph,
bishop of Anjou, E., bishop of Le Mans, and M., bishop of
Nantes, as also in presence of Hugh de Nunant, bishop of
Chester elect, Lisardus, bishop of Seez elect, and in presence
of the barons of Anjou, Maine, and Touraine.

These matters being accordingly arranged beforehand, the
king of England appointed servants of his, clerks and laymen,
to collect the before-mentioned tithes throughout all his terri-

mutilated.

lories beyond sea, and shortly after crossed over and landed in
England, at Winchelsea, on Saturday, the third day before the
calends of February. In the meantime, Baldwin, archbishop
of Canterbury, who had come to England before the king,
consecrated Hugh de Nunant bishop of Coventry.

Immediately upon his landing in England, our lord the
king held a great council of bishops, abbats, earls, and barons,
and many others, both clergy and laity, at Gaintington, where,
in the hearing of the people, he caused all the above-mentioned
ordinances to be proclaimed, which he had enacted on the sub-
ject of assuming the cross. After they had been proclaimed, Bald-
win, archbishop of Canterbury, and Gilbert, bishop of Rochester,
his deputy, delivered wonderful sermons on the same day before
the king and his chief men, on the subject of the Word of the
Lord and the mysteries of salvation gained by the cross.

After this, our lord the king sent his servants, the clerks
and laymen, throughout all the counties of England, to collect
the tithes according to his order made as above-mentioned
in his territories beyond sea. But in each of the cities
throughout England he caused all the richest men to be se-
lected, namely, in London two hundred, in York one hun-
dred, and in other cities according to their quantity and num-
bers, and made them all appear before him on days and places
named ; on which he received from them the tenths of their
property, according to an estimate made by trustworthy men
who were acquainted with their incomes and possessions ; and
if he found any inclined to be contumacious, he immediately
caused them to be imprisoned and kept in irons until they had
paid the last farthing. He did the same with the Jews in his
territories, and received from them an immense sum of money.

After this, he sent Hugh, bishop of Durham, and others of
the clergy and laity, to William, king of the Scots, to collect
the tithes in his kingdom ; on hearing which the king of Scot-
land met them between Werk and Brigham, in Lothian, and
would not allow them to enter his kingdom to collect the
tithes, but offered to give to his liege lord the king of England
five thousand marks of silver instead of the above-named tithes,
and on condition that he might have his castles back again ;
but to this the king of England would not agree.

Philip, king of the Franks, also caused the tenths of the in-
comes and property of his subjects to be collected throughout
all his territories. In the same year, Richard, earl of Poitou,

Raymond, count of Saint Gilles, Aimar, count of Angouleine,
Geoffrey de Rancon, Geoffrey de Lezivant, 81 and nearly all
the more powerful men in Poitou, engaged in war, all against
the before-named Richard, and he against all; he, however,
was victorious. Among other persons whom he took prisoners
in the territory of the count of Saint Gilles, he captured Peter
Seillun, by whose advice the before-named count of Saint Gilles
had taken some traders of the territory of the earl of Poitou, and
had done many injuries to him and his lands. Accordingly, earl
Eichard placed this Peter in close confinement and in most rigor-
ous custody. The count of Saint Gilles being able on no terms
to ransom him, he set spies throughout his cities and castles, to
arrest any persons they could find belonging to the household of
the king of England, or of earl Richard his son ; and it so hap-
pened that, a few days after, as Robert Poer and his brother
Ralph, two knights of the household and retinue of our lord the
king, were passing through the territories of the count of Saint
Gilles, from Saint Jago, 62 which they had been visiting on a pil-
grimage, the men of the count of Saint Gilles laid hands on
them, and carried them in chains to the count ; on which,
the count said to them, " Unless Richard, the earl of Poitou,
delivers up to me my servant Peter, and sets him at liberty,
you shall not escape from my hands." On hearing this, earl
Richard made answer, that he would neither make entreaties
or give money for their ransom, inasmuch as the respect due to
their character as pilgrims, ought to suffice for their libera-
tion.

Upon this, the king of France ordered them to be set at
liberty, not tor his love or respect for the king of England, or
for his son Richard, but out of respect and esteem for Saint
James the Apostle. However, earl Richard entered the terri-
tories of the count of Saint Gilles with a great army, laid it
waste with fire and sword, and besieged and took his' castles in
the neighbourhood of Toulouse. Upon this, the king of the
Franks, hearing the lamentations of the people of Toulouse,
sent his envoys to England to the king of England, to en-
quire if the mischief which was being done by his son
Richard was being done by his direction, and to demand
reparation for the same. To this the king of England made
answer, that his son Richard had done none of these things by

his wish or advice, and that the said Bichard had sent word to
him, by John, archbishop of Dublin, that be had done nothing
in respect thereof, but by the advice of the king of France.

In the same year, the Patriarch of the city of Antioch wrote
to the king of England to the following effect :

The Letter of the Patriarch of Antioch to Henry, king of
England.

" By the grace of the Holy God, and of the Apostolic See, the
Patriarch of Antioch, to Henry, by the same grace, the most
illustrious king of the English, his beloved lord and friend
may he govern in Him, through whom kings govern. With
tears and with sighs by these presents we announce to your ex-
cellency, the dire and inexpressible grief which we feel for the
unexpected and terrible disaster that has lately befallen us, or,
indeed, all Christendom we may rather say. Let all the world
listen, with yourself, to this our grief, that it may know whence
proceed our tears and our lamentations, or what is their end.
On the fourth day of the month of July, in the year of the
Word made incarnate one thousand one hundred and eighty-
seven, Saladin, having gathered together a multitude of our
foreign foes, engaged with those of the Christians who were in
the land of Jerusalem, and, having routed their forces, triumphed
over them to his heart's content ; the vivifying Cross being
exposed to the ridicule of the Turks ; the king being taken
prisoner, and the Master of the Temple, as also prince Bay-
mond, being slain by this accursed Saladin with his own hands ;
while bishops, Templars, and Hospitallers, in all a multitude
of nearly twelve hundred, and thirty thousand foot were
slaughtered in the defence of the Holy Cross, besides a con-
siderable number who were afterwards slain, or made pri-
soners in the cities which he took. After this, being quite
satiated with the blood of the Christians, he took Tiberias and
fortified it ; and then, he had laid siege to the noble city of
Acre, to Caiphas, Ca3sarea, Joppa, Nazareth, Sebaste, Neapolis,
Lydda, Bamatha, Assur, Hebron, Bethlehem, and, last of all,
the Holy City of Jerusalem, and the Sepulchre of our Lord,
vowing that he would cut it into pieces and throw its frag-
ments into the deep. As for the rest, fearful anxiety possesses
us every day and every hour, amid our doubts whether these
various places may not be subjugated to his dominion, and
their inhabitants slain or made captive, especially as it is well

known that they are deprived of provisions, horses, muni-
tions of war, and defenders. By reason of this mighty
anger and indignation of God poured forth upon us from above,
with tears we eat our bread, and are alarmed with dreadful
apprehensions, lest the Sepulchre of our Lord may be delivered
to strange nations, and lest we few, who still remain in this
Christian land, may, if succours are tardy in their arrival, and
our enemies press on, have to bow our necks to the swords of
the smiters. Now as, in prudence, counsel, and riches, you
surpass the other kings of the West, your aid we have always
looked for; and we therefore pray that you will hasten to bring
your powerful succour to the Holy Land. If you delay so to do,
then the Sepulchre of the Lord, with the noble city of Antioch,
and the territory adjacent thereto, will exist as an everlasting
reproach to foreign nations. Be mindful of your glories and of
your name, that so, God, who has raised you to a throne, may
through you be exalted ; and if youare ready to give your assist-
ance to so worthy an object, either coming yourself to us, or send-
ing to us the wished-for succours, then to you, after God, will be
imputed the liberation of the Holy Land. "We ourselves, with
all possible contrition, and smiting our guilty breast, cry unto
God that He will give to you both the will and the ability of
thus acting to the praise and glory of His name ; wherefore, at
this, the last gasp of life, in your clemency lend your aid to the
Holy Land and to ourselves. Otherwise, we who, subjected to
various perils, have been afflicted with a lingering illness, shall
have nothing to expect but immediate death for ourselves, and
that after the blood of the Christians has been poured forth,
the Sepulchre of our Lord, with the noble city of Antioch,
and the country thereto adjacent, will, to the eternal disgrace of
foreign nations, be captured. We do further entreat, that you
will receive our recommendations of our dearly beloved brethren,
the bishops of Gabalus and Valenia, whom on this matter we
have despatched to you. Farewell."

rusalem and Antioch, and Raymond, prince of Antioch.

the Lord has in our times visited our iniquities with the rod of
His vengeance, and has, by the Divine judgment, permitted the
land which was redeemed with His own blood to be polluted by
the hands of the unbelievers ; it is therefore becoming, that we r
and all who belong to the Christian religion, and are professors of
that name, should attend with pious zeal to the desolate state of
the said land, and make it our endeavour with all our might to
impart thereto our aid and counsel. "Wherefore, as A., by the
grace of God, the venerable bishop of Yalenia, has, with a profu-
sion of tears and deep sighs, disclosed unto us the griefs and
calamities with which the Eastern Church is afflicted, the greater
the danger we behold impending, the more strenuous and im-
mediate is the assistance which we are prompted by compassion
to give. Having, therefore, faith and confidence in Him, who
never forsakes those who put their trust in Him, act manfully,
and let your hearts be strengthened in the Lord; for we believe
that now is the prophecy of Isaiah fulfilled ; " Jerusalem, lift up
thine eyes round about and see ; all they gather themselves to-
gether, they come to thee ; Then thou shalt see, and flow

together, and thine heart shall fear, and be enlarged ; because
the abundance of the sea shall be converted unto thee, the
forces of the Gentiles shall come unto thee." 83 For now, the
Lord, who looks down upon the sons of men, that He may see
if man is of good understanding or seeks God, has so aroused
the feelings of the Christians, which were before asleep, to His
own service, that every one who is of the Lord's side, has now
girded his sword to his thigh, and each one reckons himself as
blessed and faithful, who leaves his father and his mother and all
things besides, that he may be able to avenge the injuries done to
Christ, and to the Holy Land. Wherefore, be ye firm, and you
shall speedily see the assistance of the Lord which is now prepar-
ing for you. For sooner than you could believe, such vast mul-
titudes of the faithful will by land and sea come to your rescue, as
' Eye hath not seen nor ear heard, nor hath it entered into the
heart of man to conceive ;' and whom the Lord has prepared
for the deliverance of your land. Among other princes as well,
I and my son, rejecting the pomps of this world, and setting
at nought all its pleasures, and all things that belong to this
world being laid aside, will shortly, by the assistance of the
Lord, visit you in our own persons. Farewell."

In the same year, Philip, king of France, levying a large

army, entered Berry, and took Chateau Raoul, which the
burgesses surrendered to him ; and, proceeding thence, nearly
the whole of Berry was delivered up to him, with the excep-
tion of Luches, and the other castles, demesnes of the king
of England. Buchard of Vendome also surrendered to the
king of France, with his lands and castles, and became his
adherent. On the king of England making enquiry why this
was done, he was told that the king of France was acting thus
in revenge for the injuries that Itichard, earl of Poitou, had
done to himself and the count of Saint Gilles. Having, there-
fore, held counsel with his trusty advisers, the king of Eng-
land sent Baldwin, archbishop of Canterbury, and Hugh,
bishop of Lincoln, to the king of France ; that they might,
at least, by words and exhortations, assuage the anger and in-
dignation which, in his mind, he had conceived against him.

These prelates being unable to succeed in their object,
the king of England crossed over from England to Nor-
mandy, and landed at Harneur on the fifth day before the ides
of July; and going thence to Alenson, levied a great army
in Normandy and the rest of his territories. Many of the
Welch also accompanied him to Normandy as mercenaries.
In the meantime, liichard, earl of Poitou, having raised a
considerable force, marched into Berry ; on hearing of whose
approach, the king of France gave Chateau Raoul into the
charge of William des Barres, and he himself returned into
France. On this, earl Richard ravaged the lands of the earls
and barons who had given in their adhesion to the king of
France, and took many of them prisoners. The king of France,
however, in consequence of the arrival of the king of Eng-
land, did not dare to move out of France, but directed his
army to lay waste the territories of the king of England.

On this, Philip, bishop of Beauvais, entered Normandy with
an army, and ravaged with fire Blangeville, a town belonging
to the earl of Auch, and Aumaiie, a castle of William, earl of
Mandeville, together with the adjoining provinces. The king
of France also burned the town of Trou, and the whole of the
fortress there, but could not gain possession thereof; how-
ever, he took forty of the knights of the king of England. On
the other hand, liichard, earl of Poitou, took an extremely
well fortified place, which is called Lcs Bodies, beyond Trou,
towards Vendome, and captured in that place twenty-five
knights and sixty yeomen.

On this, Henry, king of England, sent Walter, archbishop
of Eouen, John, bishop of Evreux, and William Marshal to
the king of France, to demand reparation for the injuries which
he and his people had done him ; and if he should refuse to re-
store what he had taken away, he defied him. To this the king
of France made answer that he would not desist from his pur-
pose until the whole of Berry, and the whole of the Norman
vexin should have been subjected to himself and to his kingdom.
Having, therefore, now got an excuse, by reason of the injuries
done to him by the king of France, Henry, king of England,
levying a large army, entered the lands of the king of France,
on the Tuesday after the beheading of Saint John the Baptist,
and, burning many villages, rode the same day to the town
of Mante, where the king of France was said to be. Here
William des Barres and Drago de Merlou, accompanied by a few
French knights, met Eichard, earl of Poitou, and William,
earl of Mandeville, and some others of the household of the
king of England ; upon which, William des Barres was taken
prisoner by earl Eichard, and given in charge to his men ; but
while the people of the king of England were intent on other
matters, the said William des Barres made his escape upon his
page's horse.

On the Wednesday following, the king of England made
a halt at Ivery, on which earl Eichard set out for Berry, pro-
mising the king his father that he would serve him well and
faithfully. On the Thursday after, being the feast of Saint
Gilles, the Welch troopers of the king of England entered the
territories of the king of France, and burned Daneville, the castle
of Simon Daneth, together with many villages, and carried off
considerable booty, after slaying many men. The same day,
earl William de Mandeville burned the town of Saint Clair,
which belongs to the demesnes of the king of France, and laid
waste a very fine shrubbery which the king himself had planted.

On the same day, the king of England, having with a few
knights entered the territories of the king of France, that he
might ascertain the weak points of those parts, there came to
him envoys from the king of France to sue for peace, and
offer him the lands which he had taken from him in Berry.
Upon this, a conference was held between them at Gisors,
where they were unable to come to terms as to making
peace ; the king of France, aroused to anger and indignation
thereat, cut down a very fine elm situate between Gisors



A.D. 1188. TRANSACTIONS IN NORMANDY. 89

and Trie, wnere conferences had been usually held between
the kings of France and the dukes of Normandy, vowing that
thenceforth there should be no more conferences held there.
The earl of Flanders, however, and earl Theobald, and other
earls and barons of the kingdom of France, laid down their
arms, saying that they would never bear arms against Chris-
tians until they should have returned from their pilgrimage to
Jerusalem.

Upon this, the king of France, being deprived of the aid of
his allies, requested an interview with the king of England ;
which being acceded to, it was accordingly held at Chatillon, on
the morrow of the day of Saint Faith, where terms of peace
were to have been agreed to between them, as follows ; the
king of France was to restore to the king of England what-
ever he had seized in his territories after the truce was broken,
and earl Eichard was to restore to the count of Saint Gilles
whatever he had taken from him by force of arms. The king
of France also, prompted by his faithlessness, demanded of the
king of England the castle of Pascy in pledge ; and, because the
king of England refused to assent thereto, they separated
mutually dissatisfied ; and the king of France, leaving the place,
took the castle of Palud ; then passing through Chateau
Eaoul, he led thence a Rout of Brabanters as far as Bourges,
promising them ample pay; but on arriving at Bourges they
were seized, and the king took from them their horses, arms,
and the whole of their money, and turned them adrift un-
armed and stripped.

Earl Richard, however, made an offer to the king of France
to come to his court and to take his trial as to the matters
that had taken place between him and the count of Saint Gilles ;
that so at least peace might be made between the king of
France and the king of England, his father ; a thing which
greatly displeased the king, his father.

After this conference, JSfevolun Fitz Urse de Fretteval
swore fealty to the king of England, and faithful service against
all men ; on which the king of England secured to him by
charter the honors of Lavardin and Faye ; he also gave to the
king of England his son as a hostage, and many of the sons of
his relations.

The Letter of Terricius, Master of the Temple, to Henry, ling
of England.

"To his most dearly beloved lord, Henry, by the grace of
God, the illustrious king of the English, duke of Normandy
and Aquitaine, and earl of Anjou, the brother Terricius, formerly
Grand Master of the house of the Temple at Jerusalem, health
in Him who gives health unto kings. Be it known to you that
Jerusalem, with the Tower of David, has been surrendered to
Saladin. The Syrians, also, have possession of the Sepulchre
until the fourth day after the feast of Saint Michael, and
Saladin himself has given permission to ten of the brethren of
the Hospital to remain in the Hospital for one year to attend the
sick. The brethren of the Hospital of Bellivier are still making
a stout resistance to the Saracens, and have .already taken two
caravans of the Saracens; by the capture of one of which they
have manfully recovered all the arms, utensils, and provisions
that were in the castle of Faba, which had been destroyed by
the Saracens. The following places also still show resistance to
Saladin, Cragus of Montreal, Montreal, Saphet of the Temple,
Cragus of the Hospital, Margat, Castel Blanco, the terri-
tory of Tripolis and the territory of Antioch. On the cap-
ture of Jerusalem, Saladin ordered the Cross to be taken
down from the Temple of our Lord, and had it carried about
the city for two days in public view, and beaten with sticks.
After this he ordered the Temple of our Lord to be washed
inside and out with rose-water, from top to bottom, and his
laws to be promulgated with regard to it in four different
places amid wondrous acclamations. 81 From the feast of Saint
Martin until the Circumcision of our Lord he besieged Tyre,
while thirteen stone engines day and night were incessantly
hurling stones against it. At the Vigil of Saint Sylvester, our
lord the Marquis Conrad arranged his knights and foot- soldiers
along the city walls, and, having armed seventeen galleys and
ten smaller vessels, with the assistance of the house of the
Hospital and of the brethren of the Temple, fought against the
galleys of Saladin, and, routing them, took eleven, and captured
the high admiral of Alexandria together with eight other
admirals, slaying vast numbers of the Saracens. The rest of
the galleys of Saladin, escaping from the hands of the Chris-
tians, fled to the army of the Saracens ; on which, by his com-

Koran, as to the sanctity of the Temple.

mand being drawn on shore, Saladin with his own hand had
them reduced to ashes and embers ; and, moved with exces-
sive grief, after cutting off the ears and tail of his horse, rode
upon it in the sight of all through the whole army. Farewell."
In the same year, John, bishop of Dunkeld, after the Purifi-
cation of the Virgin Mary, returned from the court of our lord
the pope, Hugh, bishop of Saint Andrew's, having been de-
posed, bringing with him letters from our lord the pope to the
following effect :

The Letter of pope Clement to the bishops of Glasgow and
Aberdeen.

" Clement, the bishop, servant of the servants of God, to
his venerable brethren Jocelyn, bishop of Glasgow, Mat-
thew, bishop of Aberdeen, and to his dearly beloved sons
Everard, abbat of Melrose, and Bertram, prior of Coldingham,
health and the Apostolic benediction. Lest what has been
done might cause scruples by reason of distrust, it is proper that
the same should be committed to writing, and be introduced
by a public and truthful intimation to the notice of those whom
it may seem to interest. Now we bear in mind that pope
Urban, of blessed memory, our predecessor, enjoined Hugh,
formerly styled bishop of Saint Andrew's, to appear in his
presence on a certain day, to make answer in the Apostolic
court, respecting the dispute which existed between him and
our venerable brother, bishop John, under penalty of excom-
munication if he should neglect so to do. But, inasmuch as
he was conscious of his deeds, and dreaded the result of the
investigation, he contumaciously refused to appear ; wherefore,
for this and for many other things which, according to fre-
quent reports, had created scandal to the Church of God, with
the advice and consent of our brethren, we have adjudged
him, on the authority of the Apostolic See, to be for ever re-
moved from the bishopric of Saint Andrew's, and suspended
from the episcopal office until such time as the Apostolic See
shall think fit to determine otherwise respecting him, absolving
those subject to him from the fealty which they have been
bound to pay to him ; and further, inasmuch as the rules of the
holy canons forbid that churches should be deprived too long
of the pastoral control, we do command your discretion, by
these Apostolic writings, diligently on our behalf to advise
our dearly-beloved sons, the chapter of Saint Andrew's, to
choose for themselves such a bishop and pastor, as may be

able worthily to enjoy the dignities of the episcopal office ;
and more especially, you are to labour to induce them, as
far as in you lies, to make choice, without any scruple or
difficulty, of the before-named bishop John, a man of good cha-
racter, and for his virtues acceptable to us and our brethren,
for the governance and prelacy of that church. And if all of
you shall not be able to take part in the performance hereof,
then any two of you may carry out the same. Given at
Pisa, on the seventeenth day before the calends of February, in
the sixth year of the indie tion."

The Letter of the same pope to William, king of the Scots.

" Clement, the bishop, servant of the servants of God, to
William, the illustrious king of the Scots, health and the
Apostolic benediction. "We are of opinion that it must shock
the eyes of the majesty of God in no small degree if we leave
without due correction those excesses of prelates which, with
a safe conscience, we may not, through carelessness, neglect.
Wherefore, inasmuch as pope Urban, of blessed memory, our
predecessor, commanded Hugh, formerly styled bishop of Saint
Andrew's, under pain of excommunication, to appear in his
presence on a certain day, to make answer in the Apostolic
court respecting the dispute which existed between him and our
venerable brother bishop John ; but he, being conscious of his
own deeds, and not without reason dreading the result of
the investigation, through contumacy, neglected to come, for
this and for many other things, which, according to frequent
reports, have caused scandal to the Church of God, with the
advice and consent of our brethren, we have adjudged him, on
the authority of the Apostolic See, to be for ever removed
from the bishopric of Saint Andrew's, and suspended from the
episcopal office until such time as the Apostolic See shall think
fit to determine otherwise respecting him, absolving those
subject to him from the fealty which they have been bound to
pay him. For although, so far as with God's assistance we may,
we firmly purpose to consult your honor and your interest ;
and, in the case of the before-named Hugh, the Roman court,
not without the censure of many, has hitherto paid deference
to your royal highness, still, inasmuch as the reports about
Mm have, on undoubted authority, reached our ears, we have
been unable, under any pretext, by closing our eyes thereto, any
longer to forbear noticing his errors ; for which reason we do

not think that anything has been done in his respect as to which
your royal feelings ought on any account to he incensed.
Therefore we ask your duteousness with prayers and affec-
tionate entreaties, that you will receive, on our recommendation,
the above-named bishop John, (whom we and our brethren
love with sincerity of heart for his virtues,) with the bowels
of brotherly love, as you respect the Apostolic See and our-
selves ; and that laying aside the offence which, if any, in
your indignation you have conceived against him, you will
treat him in all respects with your royal clemency and kindness.
And further, it is our belief that from his diligence and probity
much benefit will accrue, by the aid of God, to yourself and
your kingdom ; and it will always be a subject of gratification
to us, if our prayers shall with the royal ears have the desired
effect. Given at Pisa, on the seventeenth day before the
calends of February, in the sixth year of the indiction."

The Letter of the same pope to Henry, king of England.

1 ' Clement, the bishop, servant of the servants of God, to Henry,
the illustrious king of the English, health and the Apostolic be-
nediction. When your royal excellency, authority, and power
has received prayers preferred by the Apostolic See, to which
it is expedient effect should be given both for preserving the
churches in their present state, and for ensuring the salvation
of many, it is the duty of your royal highness diligently to listen
thereto ; and the more strenuously and zealously to use all en-
deavours to give effect to the same, the more certain it is that
duteous attention thereto, and the diligent execution thereof,
equally concerns your kingly glory and your salvation. Hence
it is that we have thought fit that our Apostolic letters and
prayers should be addressed to your serene highness in behalf
of our venerable brother John, bishop of Saint Andrew's, with
full confidence, therein entreating and advising, and for the
remission of the sins of all, enjoining, your exalted royal high-
ness with all the affection we possibly can, that, in considera-
tion of your veneration for Saint Peter and ourselves, as also in
consideration of the persecutions which there is no doubt he
has endured, you will earnestly advise William, the illustrious
king of the Scots, our most dearly-beloved son in Christ, and
induce him, and if necessary compel him with that royal autho-
rity in which you are his superior, and which has been con-
ceded by him to your royal highness, to cease, by setting

aside every pretext for the same, all the rancour of his indigna-
tion which, through the malice of certain whisperers, he has
entertained against the said bishop, thus shewing due regard for
his own royal dignity and the healthful works of piety ; and,
for the future to allow him quietly and without challenge to
hold the diocese of Saint Andrew's, which, by the common
counsel and consent of his brethren, the Supreme Pontiff has
confirmed unto him for ever ; and this the more especially,
as he is ready to prove himself obedient and faithful in all
respects to his royal majesty so far as shall be consistent with

The Letter of pope Clement in behalf of John, bishop of Saint
Andrew's.

" Clement, the bishop, servant of the servants of God, to alL
the clergy of the see of Saint Andrew's, health and the Apos-
tolic benediction. Although in doubtful matters some per-
sons may be able to show their subtlety or artfulness, still,
when all scruples and grounds for doubt are removed, and by
manifest signs the tracks of truth are disclosed, all devious
paths ought to be entirely forgotten, and the traces of the right
path to be both sought for and observed ; lest, which God for-
bid, acting otherwise, and persisting in their own contumacy,
after the scourges of this world, and its condign punishments,
they may be inwardly destroyed by the everlasting punishments
of eternal death. Wishing, therefore, in our paternal anxiety
to provide for your salvation, your interests, and your quietude,
we do, by these Apostolic writings, command and order, and
in virtue of your obedience, enjoin the whole of you, within
fifteen days after the receipt hereof, humbly and duteously to
receive as your father and pastor our venerable brother John,
your bishop, who has been canonically elected to the pontifical
office, and, all pretexts whatsoever laid aside, not to hesitate
henceforth to pay due reverence and obedience to his whole-
some advice and commands ; being hereby informed that if, after
Hugh, the man who was formerly styled the bishop, was re-
moved from the dignity of your bishopric by the Church of Rome,
or after his decease, 85 the above-named John, your bishop, still
surviving, you shall have by chance made choice of any other
bishop, we do, by the Apostolic authority, pronounce that elec-

tion to be null and void. But if, which may God forbid, you have
presumed, by the persuasion of the enemy of mankind, to be
guilty of any conspiracy against the said bishop John, then
both yourselves, as also the whole see, we are determined to
subject to sentence of interdict until such time as. acknow-
ledging your transgressions, you shall have re turned to obedience
to the commands oi: the said bishop John. Given at Pisa, on the
seventeenth day before the calends of February, in the sixth
year of the indiction."

Another Letter of the same pope on the same subject.

" Clement, the bishop, servant of the servants of God, to his
venerable brethren, Jocelyn, bishop of Glasgow, Matthew,
bishop of Aberdeen, and Richard, bishop of Moray, and his
dearly-beloved sons Ernulph, abbat of Melrose, Hugh, abbat
of Newbottle, and the abbats of Holyrood, Stirling, and Scone,
health and the Apostolic benediction. Although it is our belief
that, even without our advice, it is incumbent upon you to give
your serious and diligent attention, in conformity with the duties
of your office, to those things which concern a good life and
conduce to the salvation of souls, still, we have thought fit,
by these Apostolic letters, to exhort your diligence to manifest
greater anxiety in these respects; to the end that the more
fervently you devote yourselves to those works so worthy of
all praise, the more healthful it may be for you in these re-
spects to apply yourself with all diligence to comply with the
exhortations of the Apostolic See. And whereas it is clear
that some prelates of churches must, together with those who
have been offended, submit to the heat of persecution, and be
weak with those who are weak, in obedience tothe rule laid down
by the Apostle 86 how great the persecutions which the church of
Saint Andrew's has lately sustained, how great the calamities
and oppressions it has endured ! how much, also, has it been dis-
turbed and shaken of late under the shadow of the indignation
of his royal highness ! and, above all, how many and how great
the dangers which our brother John, the bishop of Saint Andrew's,
has endured ! how many the perils to which he has been exposed,
and what have been his labours in preserving the liberties of the
church entrusted to his care, and confirmed to him by ourselves
and our two predecessors ! butinasmuch as all this is well known
to you, it seems needless to reiterate the same to your hearing.
66 Alluding to the words in 1 Cor. ix. 21, 22.



96 ANNALS OF EOGEK DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1188.

But inasmuch as it is universally agreed upon as being most ex-
pedient, it befits us to give all due attention both to the king's
salvation, to the reformation of the state of the before-named
church, and to the preservation of peace for the bishop himself, we
deem it proper that we should employ your circumspection to
aid us therein ; therefore we do, by these Apostolic writings, com-
mand and enjoin your discretion, that, on receiving these our
letters, meeting together, as befits prudent and discreet men,
you will repair to the presence of our most dearly -beloved son in
Christ, William, the illustrious king of Scotland, and diligently
advise, and urgently press him to put an end to the ran-
cour of his indignation against the before-named bishop, and
herein not to despise the Church of Rome, which has now for a
long time deferred to the wishes of his serene highness, but
without delay wholesomely to obey and humbly to assent to the
advice of it and of yourselves, in such manner as befits
his royal glory and his salvation, and to allow the before-
named bishop to hold in peace the above-mentioned diocese
of Saint Andrew's ; inasmuch as he is bound by the duties
of the kingly dignity not to disperse the churches with their
shepherds, but rather to cherish them ; not to despise them,
but to love them ; not to persecute them, but to defend them.
But if, which God forbid, he shall, to the peril of his own
salvation, think proper to resist this Apostolic advice, then, by
the Apostolic authority, you are to inform him, that, within
twenty days, without any obstacle arising from appeal, sentence
of interdict will be pronounced by you against the kingdom of his
highness, and against his own person, as also all the abettors of
his majesty. Those also who have remained obedient to Hugh,
and have given him encouragement in his obstinacy, after the
Apostolic See had removed him for ever from the diocese of
Saint Andrew's, and had pronounced sentence of excommunica-
tion against him, you are to smite with a like sentence, and,
publicly pronouncing them to be excommunicated, are to cause
them to be strictly avoided by others, until they shall have
returned to obedience to the Church, and sought the benefit
of absolution from the said bishop : and further, you are, in con-
formity with the usage of the Church, to make purification and
sane tification of the altars and chalices, with which the said Hugh
has, since he has been placed under sentence of excommuni-
cation, celebrated Divine service. You are also in like manner
to repair to the church of Saint Andrew's, and, convoking the



A.n. 1188. PESTILENCE AT EOME. 97

brethren to enter the chapter-house, and make diligent enquiry
as to the order and state of the church ; and if you shall find
anything in the said church changed by the before-named
Hugh, or enacted by him, you are, of our authority, to place
it again in its proper state ; and if anything therein shall stand
in need of correction, you are zealously to endeavour to change
the same for the better. But if, and may it not be so, you
shall find any of the canons reluctant to receive their before-
named pastor humbly and devoutly, and contumaciously inclined,
you are most earnestly to advise them to shew due respect and
obedience to him, their father, and to cease to persist in their
malignant and damnable purpose. And if they shall continue
to be contumacious, you are to suspend them both from their
duties and their benefices, and to check them by the ban of .
excommunication, under which you are to hold them, until
they shall have listened to the mandates and advice of the
Church. And if all of you shall not be able to take part in
the performance hereof, then let the rest carry out the same.
Given at Pisa, on the seventeenth day before the calends of
February, in the sixth year of the indiction."

On hearing these things, the king of Scotland, being pre-
vailed upon by the counsels and entreaties of his people, re-
ceived the before-named bishop John into his favour, and
allowed him peaceably to hold the bishopric of Dunkeld, and all
the revenues which he had held before his consecration, on
condition, however, that the said John should give up all claim
to the bishopric of Saint Andrew's. Accordingly, the bishop,
though protected in the assertion of his claim by the before-
mentioned letters of our lord the pope, obeyed the king's will in
all respects, and released the bishopric of Saint Andrew's from
all claims of his, throwing himself upon the mercy of God and of
the king, well knowing that " Better is a dry morsel and quiet-
ness therewith, than a house full of sacrifices with strife." 87

Hugh, however, who was formerly styled bishop of Saint
Andrew's, on being degraded and excommunicated, proceeded to
Rome. Here, having given security to abide by the decision
of the Church, he was, in his clemency, absolved by our lord
the pope, but only survived a few days. For, in the month of
August, there was such a great pestilence at Rome and in its
territories, that many of the cardinals and most wealthy men in
the city died, with a countless multitude of the lower classes :
87 Prov. xvii. 1.

on which occasion this Hugh, with nearly the whole of his house-
hold, and Henry, the bishop elect of Dol, with his household,
died there. On this, the king of Scotland gave the bishopric of
Saint Andrew's to Roger, son of the earl of Leicester, his
chancellor, John, bishop of Dunkeld, being present, and making
no objection thereto. The king of Scotland also gave his
chancellorship to Hugh de Roxburgh, his clerk.

In the same year, on the twelfth day before the calends of
October, being the third day of the week, and the vigil of Saint
Matthew the Apostle and Evangelist, nearly the whole of the
town of Beverley, with the noble church of Saint John the
Archbishop, was burnt. In the same year, master John Gil-
bert, of Sempringham, 88 first founder and pastor of the order
which is called the order of Sempringham, departed this life,
and was buried in his church at Sempringham, among the nuns.

In the same year, Gilbert de Ogleston, a brother of the
Temple, who had been elected and appointed by our lord the
king of England, together with some others, clerks and laymen,
to collect the tenths, was detected in the mal-appropriation
thereof; but as the king could not, by the ordinary mode of
trial, pass sentence upon him, he handed him over to the
Master of the Temple, at London, in order that he might be
dealt with according to the statutes of his order. On this
the master of the Temple placed him in irons, and inflicted
on him various punishments ; but as to what those various
punishments were, it is for you to enquire, who feel an interest
in the concerns of that order.

In the same year, a thing took place at Dunstable, in Eng-
land, very wonderful to be mentioned and glorious to be seen,
on the vigil of Saint Lawrence the Martyr, being the second
day of the week ; for, about the ninth hour of the day, the
heavens opened, and, in the sight of many, both clergy and
laity, a cross appeared, very long and of wonderful magnitude,
and it appeared as though Jesus Christ was fastened thereto
with nails, and crowned with thorns ; His hands also were
stretched out on the cross, and the wounds of His hands, and
feet, and sides were bloody, and His blood was flowing down,
but did not fall upon the earth. This appearance lasted from
the ninth hour of the day till twilight.

88 In Lincolnshire called " Semplingham" in the text. This order
was, from its founder, called " the Gilbertines." Both men and women
lived in their houses, but separated by high walls.



A. D. 1188. REPORT OF THE ENVOYS OF THE KING OF FRANCE. 99

In the same year, the king of England and 'the king of
France held a conference, between Bonimolt and Sulenne, on
the fourteenth day before the calends of September, being the
sixth day of the week. At this conference the king of
France offered to restore to the king of England whatever he
had taken from him in war, upon the following conditions :
That he should give his sister Alice in marriage to his son
Richard, and should allow homage and fealty to be done to the
said Richard, his heir, by the people of his territories. But the
king of England, not forgetful of the injuries which the king,
his son, had done to him in return for a similar promotion,
made answer that he would on no account do so. At this,
earl Richard being greatly indignant, without the advice and
wish of his father, did homage to the king of France fop all
the possessions of his father beyond sea, and, swearing fealty
to him against all men, became his adherent : on which, the
king of France gave to him Chateau Raoul, and Yssoudun,
with the whole honor thereof, in return for his homage and
fealty. However, the before-named kings made a truce be-
tween them until the feast of Saint Hilary ; but Henry, the
cardinal-bishop of Albano, whom our lord the pope had sent
to put an end to the dispute between the before-named kings,
excommunicated earl Richard, because he had broken the
peace, and then, returning to Flanders, he died at Arras.

In the same year, the envoys of the king of France, whom
he had sent to Isaac, the emperor of Constantinople, on their
return home, reported that the sultan of Iconium had given his
daughter in marriage to the son of Saladin, and that Saladin had
given his daughter to the son of the sultan; and that Daniel, a
prophet of Constantinople, had prophesied that in the same

fyear in which the Annunciation of our Lord should be on
Easter day, 88 the Franks should recover the Land of Promise,
and should stall their horses in the palm groves of Baldack, 8 '
and should pitch their tents beyond the trees of the desert, and
that the tares should be separated from the wheat. They also
reported that in the palace of the emperor of Constantinople
more honor was paid to the envoys of Saladin than to any other
persons of the very highest dignity; and that, with the consent
of the emperor of Constantinople, Saladin had sent his idol
to Constantinople, in order that it might there be publicly
worshipped; but, by the grace of God, before it arrived.

88 The latter being a moveahle feast.

89 Probably meaning either Baalbec or Bagdad.

there the Venetians captured it at sea; on which, together
with the ship, it was taken to Tyre. They also reported that
a certain old man, a Greek by birth, from Astralix, had informed
them that the prophecy was about to be fulfilled which
was written on the Golden Gate, which had not been opened
for two hundred years past ; which was this, " When the
Yellow-haired King of the West shall come, then shall I open
of my own accord, and then shall the Latins reign, and
hold rule in the city of Constantinople." They also stated
that the emperor had promised Saladin a hundred galleys,
and that Saladin had promised him the whole of the land of
promise, if he should impede the passage of the Franks ; and
that, in consequence of this, the emperor had forbidden any one
throughout all his territories to assume the cross ; and if by
chance 'any one in his territories did assume the cross, he was
immediately arrested and thrown into prison. There was
also a prophecy and astrological prediction among the Greeks
and Turks, that within the next three years one third of the
Turks should perish by the sword, another third should fly
beyond the trees of the desert, 90 and the remaining third be
baptized.

In the same year, a certain monk, of the Cistercian order, a
religious man and one who feared God, beheld a vision of this
nature relative to Henry, king of England. There appeared
to him in his sleep a man of wonderful magnitude and noble
features, and clothed in white garments, who said to him,
"Observe and read these things about the king: 'I have set
my seal upon him ; the womb of his wife shall swell against him ,
and in torments he shall suffer torments, and among the veiled
women he shall be as one wearing the veil.' "

In the same year, Frederic, emperor of the Romans, having
assumed the cross at the hands of Henry, the cardinal-bishop
of Albano, as befitted a prudent and circumspect man, made
all necessary provisions for himself and his journey; for, in
the first place, he reconciled himself to God and the Holy
Church, and then wrote to Saladin to the following effect :

The Letter of Frederic, emperor of the Romans, to Saladin, ruler
of the Saracens.

" Frederic, by the grace of God, emperor of the Romans,
ever august, and the mighty triumpher over the enemies of the

Palmyra, on the north-eastern side of Syria.

empire, to Saladin, ruler over the Saracens ; may he take warning
from Pharaoh, and flee from Jerusalem. The letters which your
devoted services addressed to us a long time since, on matters
of importance to yourself, and which would have benefitted
you, if reliance could have been placed on your words, we re-
ceived, as became the mightiness of our majesty, and deemed
it proper to communicate, through the medium of our letters,
with your mightiness. But now, inasmuch as you have pro-
faned the Holy Land, over which we, by the authority of the
Eternal King, bear rule, solicitude for our imperial office
admonishes us to proceed with due rigour against audacity so
rash, so criminal, and so presumptuous. Wherefore, unless before
all things you restore the land of Judasa, Samaria, and Pales-
tine, which you have seized, with the addition thereto of due
satisfaction to be adjudged for excesses so nefarious according
to the Holy Constitutions, that we may not appear to wage an
unlawful war against you, we give you the space of the revo-
lution of one year from the beginning of the calends of Novem-
ber, in the year of the Incarnation of our Lord one thousand
one hundred and eighty-eight, after which time you must make
trial of the fortune of war on the plains of Tanis, 90 by virtue
of the vivifying Cross and in the name of the true Joseph. For
we can scarcely believe that you are ignorant of what, being
testified by the writings of the ancients and the histories of
antiquity, we are to presume is to be the course of events in
our time. Do you pretend not to know that both the .^Ethio-
pias, Mauritania, Persia, Syria, 91 Parthia, where our 92 dictator
Marcus Crassus met with a premature death, JudaBa, mari-

Idowed with distinguished virtues, passing the limits of pro-
priety and temperance, and, acting otherwise than as became
a soldier sent from the mistress of the world, became enslaved
by his sensual- passion for Cleopatra do you pretend not to

possibly allude to Psalm Ixxviii. 12. It is more probable, however, that
he alludes to the city of Tanais, or Tanis, in Saladin's kingdom of Egypt,
which was situate at the Tanaitic mouth of the Nile, and was rebuilt by
the Caliphs of the line of the Ommiades.

how effectually our own right hand, which you suppose to be

pointed for the triumph of the cause of Christ."

In the same year, on the feast of Saint Thomas the Apostle,
before the Nativity of our Lord, "William, bishop of Win-
chester, departed this life. In the same year also, Frederic,
emperor of the Romans, having given his kingdom of Ger-
many to his son Henry, leaving his city, which is called Raines-
burg, being unwilling to trust himself to the winds and waves,
determined to proceed by land ; and when he arrived at Con-
stantinople, the emperor Isaac received him very courteously,
and supplied him and his people with all necessaries.

After this, with a strong hand and outstretched arm, he
passed through the territory of the sultan of Iconium, and when
he had come into Armenia, the territory of Rupin de La-
montaigne, at a river which bears the name of Salef, when half of
his army had forded the stream, he, while accompanying the rest,

adopted the words of Roger of Wendover, instead of those in our author,
which are ' Reemia," and " Boemia." It seems impossible to say what
country is meant by " Reemia;" but it is most probably a misprint.

96 Incorrectly in the text, " Frisia."

of " Anconitana Marcia ! ! "

fell from his horse into the river, and was the only person
drowned. Accordingly, they drew him on shore, and there
disembowelled him ; after which, his entrails, brains, and flesh,
which had been boiled in water, and thus separated from the
bones, were buried in the city of Antioch. His bones being
wrapped in clean linen, Conrad, duke of Suabia, his son, carried
them with him to the city of Tyre, 98 where he buried them.

In the same year, it was enacted by our lord the pope and
the cardinals that prayers should be put up to the Lord by
the Church Universal, without intermission, for the peace and
deliverance of the land of Jerusalem and of the Christian captives
who were confined in chains by the Saracens. Mass was
performed each day in the church of Saint Paul in the follow-
ing form : when the priest had said " Pax Domini sit semper
vobiscum" [the peace of the Lord be with you always], and the
choir had made answer "Et cum spirituo tuo" [and with thy
spirit], before the " Agnus Dei" [the Lamb of God] was be-
gun, the priest or precentor commenced with this antiphone,
" Tua est potentia, tuum regnum. Domine, tu es super omnes
gentes. Da pacem, Domine, in diebus nostris' ' [ Thine is the power,
thine is the kingdom. Lord ! thou art above all nations. Grant
peace, Lord, in our days.] On the Lord's day, this was ac-
companied with the following Psalm, beginning " Quare fre-
mueunt gentes" [ WTiy do the heathen rage?] ;" on Monday, with
this Psalm, "Deus, in nomine tuo, salvum me fac" [Save me,
God, by thy name] j 1 on Tuesday, with this Psalm, " Deus repu-
listi nos et destruxisti?" [ God, Why hast thou cast us out?] 2 on
Wednesday, with this Psalm, ' ' Ut quid Deus, repulisti in finem ? ' '
[ God, why hast thou cast us of for ever ?] 3 on Thursday, with
this Psalm, " Deus, venerunt gentes in hasreditatem tuam" [0
God, the heathen are come into thine inheritance'] ; 4 on Friday, with
this Psalm, " Deus quis similis erit tibi" [God, who shall be like
unto Thee ?] 5 and on Saturday, with this Psalm, " Deus, ulti-
onum Dominus" [0 Lord God, to whom vengeance belongeth]*
After having repeated these Psalms and the antiphone before-
mentioned, the " Eyrie eleison, Christe eleison, Kyrie elei-
son" 7 was to follow, and then the " Paternoster" and the
prayer " Et ne nos;" s [after which the following sentences were

mercy, Lord, be shewn upon us. Lord, deal not with us
after our sins. Remember not our former iniquities. Assist
us, Lord of our salvation. Save thy people, Lord. Be
thou to them, Lord, a tower of strength. Let not their
enemies prevail against them. Let there be peace through
thy might, Lord. Lord God of might, correct us. Lord,
hear our prayer. The Lord be with you." " Let us pray."
" Almighty and everlasting God, in whose hands are the power
and rule of all kingdoms, in thy mercy look upon the Christian
armies, that the heathen who put trust in their own valour
may be vanquished by the might of thy right hand."

In the same year, Baldwin, archbishop of Canterbury, by
means of the influence of the king, seized into his own hands
the priory of the Holy Trinity at Canterbury ; and having ex-
pelled the monks who held offices therein from their said offices,
placed his own servants in their room, and refused sustenance to
the monks. In this year also, Honorius, prior of the church of
Canterbury, having gone to Eome to procure the restitution of
his house, departed this life at Rome, together with all the monks
whom he had taken with him. In the same year, Hugh, bishop
of Durham, having assumed the cross, gave the priory in charge
to the prior and convent of Durham, for which they Avere bound
to pay two hundred marks or more, and which he for the profits
thereof had retained in his hands for a period of two years.<

In the same year, our lord the pope, hearing of the death
of Henry, the cardinal-bishop of Albano, whom he had sent for
the purpose of settling the dispute between the king of Prance
and the king of England, sent cardinal John of Anagni for
the same purpose. In the same year, William, king of the Scots,
sent envoys to Clement, the Supreme Pontiff, and obtained
from him letters of protection to the following effect :

The Letter of pope Clement to William, king of the Scots, as to
tJie exemption of the churches of his kingdom.

" Clement, the bishop, servant of the servants of God, to
his dearly-beloved son in Christ, William, the illustrious king
of the Scots, health and the Apostolic benediction. Whereas
all persons subject to the yoke of Christ ought to find favour
and protection at the Apostolic See, it is most especially proper
that those should be supported with our defence and protection
whose fidelity and dutifulness have been experienced on the



A.D. 1188. LETTER OF POPE CLEMENT. 105

most occasions, to the end that a stronger inducement may
be held out to obtain the favours consequent upon such a
choice, and duteous affection and reverence to the same may
be more generally extended, from the fact of its being known
that they will certainly obtain the pledges of its benevolence
and favour. Wherefore, most dearly-beloved son in Christ,
considering the reverence and dutifulness which for a long
period we know you to have felt towards the Church of Rome,
by the pages of this present writing we have thought proper
to enact that the Church of Scotland, as an especial daughter
thereof, shall be subject to the Apostolic See, with no inter-
mediate party thereto ; 9 in which Church the following are
recognized as episcopal sees ; namely, the churches of Saint
Andrew's, Glasgow, Dunkeld, Dumblane, Brechin, Aberdeen,
Moray, Eoss, and Caithness. And it is to be lawful for no
one but the Eoman Pontiff or his legate a later e to pronounce
against the kingdom of Scotland any sentence of interdict or
excommunication; and if such shall be pronounced, we do
hereby decree that the same shall not be valid ; we do also
declare that it shall not be lawful for any person in future who
is not a subject of the king of Scotland, or one whom the
Apostolic See shall have especially appointed from its body for
that purpose, to hold courts in the said kingdom for the settle-
ment of disputes therein. We do moreover forbid that any dis-
putes which may exist in the said kingdom as to its possessions,
shall be brought for judgment before judges out of that king-
dom, except in cases of appeal to the Roman Church. And
further, if any written enactments shall appear to have been
obtained in contravention of the liberties hereby granted by
enactment, or if in future, no mention being therein made of
this concession, any such shall happen to be granted, nothing
to the prejudice of yourself or of your kingdom is thereby to
arise with reference to the concession of the above-mentioned
prerogative ; but we do enact that the liberties and immunities
that have in their indulgence been granted to you or to the said
kingdom or to the churches therein existing by our predecessors
the Roman Pontiffs, and hitherto observed, shall be hereby
ratified, and shall at all future times remain untouched. Let no
man therefore deem it lawful to infringe upon the tenor of this
our constitution and prohibition, or in any way to contravene
the same. And if any person shall presume to attempt so to

do, let him know that he will thereby incur the indignation
of Almighty God and of the Apostles Saint Peter and Saint
Panl. Given at the Lateran, on the third day before the
ides of March, in the first year of onr pontificate."

In the year of grace 1 1 89, being the thirty-fifth and last year
of the reign of king Henry, son of the empress Matilda, the said
Henry was at Saumur, in Anjou, on the day of the Nativity of
our Lord, which fell on the Lord's day, and there he kept
that festival ; although many of his earls and barons, deserting
him, had gone over to the king of France and earl Richard
against him. After the feast of Saint Hilary, the truce being
broken, which existed between the before-named kings, the
king of France, and earl Richard and the Bretons, (with whom
the said king of France and earl Richard had entered into
covenants, and had given sureties that if they should make
peace with the king of England, they would not omit to include
them in that peace,) made a hostile incursion into the territo-
ries of the king of England, and ravaged them in every direction.

On this, the cardinal John of Anagni came to the before-
named kings in behalf of our lord the pope, and sometimes
with kind words, sometimes with threats, exhorted them to
make peace. Moved by his urgent entreaties, the said kings,
by the inspiration of the Divine grace, gave security that they
would abide by the decision of himself, and of the archbishops
of Rheims, Bourges, Rouen, and Canterbury, and named as the
day for a conference to be held near La Fert Bernard, the oc-
tave of Pentecost ; on which the before-named cardinal, and the
four archbishops above-mentioned, pronounced sentence of ex-
communication against all, both clergy and laity, who should
stand in the way of peace being made between the said kings,
the persons of the kings alone excepted.

On the day of the conference, the king of France, and the
king of England, earl Richard, the cardinal John of Anagni,
and the four archbishops before- mentioned, who had been
chosen for the purpose, and the earls and barons of the two
kingdoms, met for a conference near La Ferte" Bernard. At
this conference, the king of France demanded of the king of
England, his sister Alice to be given in marriage to Richard,
earl of Poitou, and that fealty for his dominions should be
sworn to the said Richard, and that his brother John, assuming
the cross, should set out for Jerusalem. To this the king of
England made answer that he would never consent to such a



A.D. 1189. DEFEAT OF THE KING OF ENGLAND. 107

proposal, and offered the king of France, if he should think
fit to assent thereto, to give the said Alice in marriage to his
son John, with all the matters previously mentioned more at
large, more fully and more completely than the king de-
manded. The king of France would not agree to this ; on
which, putting an end to the conference, they separated, mutu-
ally displeased. However, the cardinal John of Anagni declared
that if the king of France did not come to a complete arrange-
ment witli the king of England, he would place the whole of
his territory under interdict; to which the king of France
made answer, that he should not dread his sentence and that
he cared nothing for it, as it was supported upon no grounds
of justice. For, he said, it was not the duty of the Church
of Rome to punish the kingdom of France by its sentence or
in any other manner, if the king of France should think fit
to punish any vassals of his who had shewn themselves un-
deserving, and rebellious against his sway, for the purpose of
avenging the insult to his crown ; he also added, that the be-
fore-named cardinal had already smelt the sterling coin of the
king of England. Then closing the interview, the king of
France departed thence, and took La Fert Bernard, and then
Montfort, and next Malestroit, Beaumont, and Balim.

After this he came to Le Mans, on the Lord's day, pretend-
ing that he was going to set out for Tours on the ensuing
Monday ; but when the king of England and his people seemed
to have made themselves at ease as to the further progress of
the king of France, he drew out his forces in battle array, for
the purpose of making an assault upon the city. This being
perceived by Stephen de Tours, the seneschal of Anjou, he set
fire to the suburbs. The fire, however, rapidly gaining strength
and volume, running along the walls, communicated with the
city; seeing which, the Franks approached a bridge of stone,
where Geoffrey de Burillun and many with him of the party
of the king of England met them with the intention of pulling
down the bridge ; on which, a desperate conflict took place,
and a great part of the armies were slain on both sides, and in
the conflict, the before named Geoffrey was taken prisoner, and
wounded in the thigh ; many others also of the king of Eng-
land's army were taken, while the rest immediately took to
flight, with the intention of betaking themselves to the city,
but the Franks entered it with them.






108 ANNALS OF BOGER DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1189.

The king of England seeing this, and being in a state of
desperation, contrary to his promise when he came, took to
flight with seven hundred of his knights. For he had pro-
mised the inhabitants of that city that he would not forsake
them, giving it as his reason, that his father rested there, as
also, the circumstance that he himself was born there, and
loved that city more than all others. The king of France pur-
sued him for three miles ; and if the stream which the Franks
forded had not been very wide and deep, they would have
pursued them as they fled with such swiftness, that they
would have been all taken prisoners. In this flight, many
of the Welch were slain. The king of England, however, with
a few of his men, got to Chinon and there took refuge within
the fort. The rest of the household of the king of England
who were surviving, took refuge within the tower of Le Mans :
immediately on which, the king of France laid siege to the
town, and, partly through his miners, partly the assaults of
his engines, the tower was surrendered to him within three
days, together with thirty knights and sixty men at arms.

Marching thence, he took Mont Double by surrender of the
castle and its lord. For the viscount of this castle had been
the means, indeed, the especial cause, of this catastrophe ; for,
lying in ambush, he had, armed, fallen upon Geoffrey, the earl
of Vendome, who was unarmed, and had wounded him so seri-
ously, that at first his life was despaired of, though by the grace
of God he afterwards entirely recovered from the effects thereof.
The king of France was the more vexed at his acting thus, be-
cause the before-named viscount had strictly bound himself to
the king of France, by a promise that he would injure none of
his people either in going or returning, or annoy him while
engaged in the siege of Le Mans. The king departing thence,
the castle of Trou was surrendered to him, together with Roche
TEveque, Montoire, Chateau Carcere, Chateau Loire, Chateau
Chaumont, Chateau d' Amboise, and Chateau de Roche Charbon.

At length, on the sixth day of the week after the festival of
the Nativity of Saint John, on the day after the feast of Saint
Peter and Saint Paul the Apostles, the king of France came to
Tours. On the Lord's day next after this, Philip, earl of
Flanders, William, archbishop of Rheims, and Hugh, duke of
Burgundy, came to the king of England, who was then at
Saumur, for the purpose of making peace between him and the



A. D. 1189. PEACE BETWEEN ENGLAND AND FRANCE. 109

king of France. The king of France had, however, sent him
word before they set out, that from Chateau Saint Martin,
whither he had betaken himself by fording the Loire, he
should make an attack upon the city. Accordingly, on the
ensuing Monday, at about the third hour, applying their
scaling ladders to the walls on the side of the Loire, which on
account of the small quantity of the water, was much contracted
and reduced, the city was taken by storm r and in it eighty
knights and a hundred men at arms.

To their great disgrace, on the one side, the Poitevins were
planning treachery against their liege lord the king of England,
and on the other the Bretons, who had joined the king of
France, and had obtained from him letters patent, to the
effect that he would never make peace with the king of Eng-
land unless the Bretons were included in the treaty. Ac-
cordingly, the king of England, being reduced to straits, made
peace with Philip, king of France, on the following terms :

Conditions of peace made between Henry, king of England and,
Philip, king of France.

" Upon this, the before-named king of France and king of
England, and Richard, earl of Poitou, with their archbishops,
bishops, earls, and barons, about the time of the feast of the
Apostles Saint Peter and Saint Paul, held a conference between
Tours and Arasie, where the king of England wholly placed
himself under the control and at the will of the king of France.
The king of England then did homage to the king of France,
although 11 at the beginning of the war he had renounced the
lordship of the king of France, and the king of France had
quitted all claim of his homage. It was then provided by the
king of France that Alice, his sister, whom the king of Eng-
land had in his charge, should be given up and placed in the
charge of one of five persons, of whom earl Richard should make
choice. It was next provided by the king of France that se-
curity should be given by the oath of certain men of that land
that his said sister should be delivered up to earl Richard on
his return from Jerusalem, and that earl Richard should receive
the oath of fealty from his father's subjects on both sides the
sea, and that none of the barons or knights who had in that
war withdrawn from the king of England and come over to earl
Richard should again return to the king of England, except
11 Meaning that it was done previous to the war breaking out.

in the last month before his setting out for Jerusalem ; the
time of which setting out was to be Mid-Lent, at which pe-
riod the said kings and earl Richard were to be at Yezelay.
That all the burgesses of the rills, demesne of the king of
England, should be unmolested throughout all the lands of
the king of France, and should enjoy their own customary
laws and not be impleaded in any matter, unless they should
be guilty of felony. The king of England was to pay to
the king of France twenty thousand marks of silver ; and all
the barons of the king of England were to make oath that if
the king of England should refuse to observe the said cove-
nants, they would hold with the king of France and earl Rich-
ard, and would aid them to the best of their ability against
the king of England. The king of France and earl Richard
were to hold in their hands the city of Le Mans, the city of
Tours, Chateau Loire, and the castle of Trou ; or else, if the king
of England should prefer it, the king of France and earl Richard
would hold the castle of Gisors, the castle of Pasci, and the
castle of Novacourt, until such time as all the matters should
be completed as arranged above by the king of France.

While the before-named kings were conferring in person
hereon, the Lord thundered over them, and a thunderbolt fell
between the two, but did them no injury ; they were, however,
greatly alarmed, and separated accordingly, while all who were
with them were astonished that the thunder had been heard
so suddenly, seeing that no lowering clouds had preceded it.
After a short time the kings again met together for a confer-
ence, on which a second time thunder was heard, still louder
and more terrible than before, the sky retaining its original
sereneness; in consequence of which, the king of England,
being greatly alarmed, would have fallen to the ground from
the horse on which he was mounted, if he had not been sup-
ported by the hands of those who were standing around him.
From that time he entirely placed himself at the will of the
king of France, and concluded peace on the terms above-
written, requesting that the names of all those who, desert-
ing him, had gone over to the king of France and earl Richard,
should be committed to writing and given to him. This being
accordingly done, he found the name of his son John written
at the beginning of the list.

Surprised at this beyond measure, he came to Chinon, and,

touched with grief at heart, cursed the day on which he was
born, and pronounced upon his sons the curse of God and of
himself, which he would never withdraw, although bishops and
other religious men frequently admonished him so to do. Being
sick even unto death, he ordered himself to be carried into
the church, before the altar, and there devoutly received the
communion of the body and blood of Christ ; and after con-
fessing his sins, and being absolved by the bishop and clergy,
he departed this life in the thirty-fifth year of his reign, on the
octave of the Apostles Saint Peter and Saint Paul, being the
fifth day of the week ; after a reign of thirty- four years, seven
months, and four days.

After his death, having plundered him of all his riches, all
forsook him ; so true it is that just as flies seek honey, wolves
the carcase, and ants corn, this crew followed not the man, but
his spoils. At last however, his servants returned, and buried
him with royal pomp. On the day after his death, when he
was being carried out for burial in the Church of the Nuns at
Fontevraud, earl Eichard, his son and heir, came to meet him,
and, smitten with compunction, wept bitterly; immediately
on which the blood flowed in streams from the nostrils of the
body at the approach of his son. His son, however, proceeded
with the body of his father to the abbey of Fontevraud, and
there buried him in the choir of the Nuns, and thus it was that
he was " among the veiled women as one wearing the veil." 12

EICHARD THE FIEST.

THE king being thus buried, earl Eichard, his son, imme-
diately laid hands on Stephen de Tours, the seneschal of
Anjou, and, throwing him into prison, loaded him with heavy
fetters and iron manacles, and demanded of him the cas-
tles and treasures of the king, his father, which he had in
his possession ; and, after the same had been delivered up, earl
Eichard 13 took ransom from him to the uttermost farthing.
Just the time at which the before-named king of England died,
Matilda, duchess of Saxony, his daughter, died.

After this, the said earl Eichard came to Eoucn, and was
girded with the sword of the dukedom of Normandy by Walter,
the archbishop of Eouen, in presence of the bishops, earls, and

barons of Normandy, on Saint Margaret's day, being the fifth
day of the week, and the thirteenth day before the calends of
August. Having then received the oaths of fealty from the
clergy and the people of the dukedom of Normandy, he gave
to Geoffrey, son of Kotrod, earl of Perche, his niece, Matilda,
daughter of the duke of Saxony, in marriage.

On the third day after this, that is to say, on the feast of
Saint Mary Magdalen, Philip, king of France, and Richard,
duke of Normandy, met to hold a conference between Chau-
mont and Trie. Here the king of France urgently requested
that the duke of Normandy would restore to him Gisors, and
many other places, which it would be tedious individually to
mention. But Richard, seeing that if he did so, it would re-
dound to his everlasting loss and disgrace, added to the before-
mentioned twenty thousand marks of silver, which the king,
his father, had covenanted that he would pay to the king of
France, another four thousand marks of silver, and by these
obtained his favour and regard ; and the king of France restored
to him everything that he had taken in war from the king, his
father, both castles as well as cities, and other fortified places,
and vills and farms as well.

;In the meantime, queen Eleanor, the mother of the before-
lamed duke, moved her royal court from city to city, and from
3astle to castle, just as she thought proper ; and sending mes-
sengers throughout all the counties of England, ordered that
all captives should be liberated from prison and confinement,
for the good of the soul of Henry, her lord ; inasmuch as, in
her own person, she had learnt by experience u that confinement
is distasteful to mankind, and that it is a most delightful re-
freshment to the spirits to be liberated therefrom. She, more-
over, gave directions, in obedience to the orders of her son,
the duke, that all who had been taken in custody for fore-
stal offences should be acquitted thereof and released, and
that all persons who had been outlawed for forestal offences
should return in peace, acquitted of all previous offences
against the forest laws; and further, that all persons who
had been taken and detained by the will of the king, or of
his justice, and who had not been detained according to the
common law of the county or hundred, or on appeal, should be
acquitted ; and that those who were detained by the common
law, if they could find sureties that they would make due re-

band, king Henry.

dress at law, in case any person should think proper to make
any charge against them, should be set at liberty; if, also,
they should make oath that they would make due redress,
if any person should think proper to make any charge against
them, even then they were to be set at liberty just as much.
Those, also, who, on appeal, had been detained in custody upon
any criminal matter, if they could find sureties that they
would make due reparation and in full, were to be set at
liberty. Those, also, who were outlawed at common law, with-
out appeal, by the justices, were to return in peace, on condi-
tion that they should find sureties that they would make duo
reparation at law, if any person should think proper to allege
anything against them ; and if they had been convicted 15
upon appeal made, if they could make peace with their ad-
versaries, they were to return in peace. All those persons,
also, who were detained upon the appeal 16 of those who knew
that they were evildoers, were to be set at liberty, free and
unmolested. Those evildoers who, for their evidence, had
been pardoned life and limb, were to abjure the territory of
their lord, Richard, and to depart therefrom ; while those evil-
doers who, without any pardon of life or limb, had accused
others of their own free-will, were to be detained in prison,
until their cases should have received due consideration.

It was further ordered, that every free man throughout the
whole kingdom should make oath that he would preserve his
fealty to his lord Richard, king of England, son of our lord
king Henry and queen Eleanor, his wife, with life and limb,
and worldly honors, as being his liege lord, against all men
and women whatsoever, who might live and die, and that
they would be obedient to him, and would give him aid in all
things for the maintenance of his peace and of justice.

In addition to this, the said duke of Normandy restored to
Robert, earl of Leicester, all his lands, which his father had
taken from him, and restored all persons to their former
rights, whom his father had deprived of their possessions. All
those persons, however, clergy as well as laity, who, leaving his
father, had adhered to himself, he held in abhorrence, and
banished from his acquaintanceship; while those who had

faithfully served his father, he retained with him, and enriched
with numerous benefits.

After this, the said duke passed over to England from Har-
fleur on the ides of August, being the Lord's day before the
Assumption of Saint Mary, the Mother of God, while Walter,
archbishop of Rouen, Henry, bishop of Bayeux, and John,
bishop of Evreux, who had preceded him to England, were there
awaiting his arrival. There came also from Normandy, Bald-
win, archbishop of Canterbury, Gilbert, bishop of Rochester,
Hugh, bishop of Lincoln, and Hugh, bishop of Chester, on
which the duke and his brother John crossed over : at the
arrival of whom, their kingdoms rejoiced, because they trusted
that through them they might be brought to a better state.
And although some, though but very few, were hurt at the
death of the king, still it was some consolation that, as the

fpoet says, ""Wonders I sing, the sun has set, no night ensued;" l
for truly no night did ensue after the setting of the sun. For

; a ray of the sun, 18 occupying the throne of the sun, spreads its
own lustre more brilliantly, and to a greater distance than its
own original sun. For when the sun has set below the earth
from his throne, his ray, still remaining, and subject to neither
eclipse or setting, being suddenly cut off from the body of the
sun, and wholly reflected back upon itself, as though a sun it-
self, it becomes much greater and much more brilliant than the
sun, of which it was a ray, by reason of no clouds intervening
and no impediment obstructing its course. But, in order that
no difficulties may harass the mind of the reader, the mean-
ing of this may be more fully ascertained on reading the fol-
lowing pentameter:

" Sol pater, et radius filius ejus erat." 19

And thus, the son becoming greater and greater, enlarged the
good works of his father, while the bad ones he cut short.
17 Mira canam, sol occubnit, nox nulla secuta esl. 18 The mean-

ing of this passage is very obscure, indeed it seems solely framed as a
quaint conceit, for the purpose of punning upon the words " sol," "solum,"
and the like. It is as follows, " Nam radius solis solium soils seriens,
sole suo jubar lucidius ac latius spargit. Cum enim sol a suo solio in
solum deciderit, stans tamen ejus radius, occasum vel eclipsim nesciens
de corpore solari repente divisus, et in se solide reverberatus sol, sole,
cujus fuit radios, nulla nubium interpolatione vel injuria impediente
multo major, et lucidior est eflfectus." He seems obscurely to allude to
the superior prosperity of Richard over his father, in consequence of having
no domestic grievances through undutiful children, who had brought clouds '
over his sunshine. 19 " The father was the suu, his son his ray."




A. D. 1189. PROMOTIONS BY THE DUKE OF NORMANDY. 115

For those whom the father disinherited, the son restored to
their former rights ; those whom the father had banished, the
son recalled ; those whom the father kept confined in irons,
the son allowed to depart unhurt ; those upon whom the father,
in the cause of justice, inflicted punishment, the son, in the
cause of humanity, forgave.

Accordingly, as already stated, Eichard, the said duke of
Normandy, son of Henry, king of England, lately deceased,
came over to England ; on which he gayj&4o~bi^4>go&er.Jjphn
the earldom of Mortaigne, and the earldoms of Cornwall,

and all their appurtenances ; the honor also of Wallingford,
the honor of Tickhill, and- the honor of Haye ; he also gavahim

him the Peak nnTTknignvpr KilT^P H "TU-P rpfainprl some castles

In addition to this, the said duke gave to Andrew de
Chauvigny the daughter of Eaoul de Dol, with the honor
of Chateau Eaoul, in Berry, (she having been the wife of Bald-
win, earl of Eivers), and had them immediately married at
Salisbury, in presence of queen Eleanor; he also gave to
William Marshal the daughter of Eichard, earl of Striguil, 20
with the earldom of Striguil; and to Gilbert, son of Eoger
Fitz-Eainfray, he gave the daughter of William de Lancaster.
To Geoffrey, his own bastard brother, who had been formerly
bishop-elect of Lincoln, he gave the archbishopric of York ;
the canons having, with the king's consent, elected him to
the archbishopric of York. And although Master Bar-
tholomew, acting as the deputy of Hurbert Fitz- Walter, the
dean of that church, both before the election and after it, ap-
pealed to the presence of the Supreme Pontiff, because
Hugh, bishop of Durham, and an especial son of that church,
and Hubert Fitz-Walter, dean of the said church, to which
parties belonged the first votes in the election, were absent,

the said canons were determined not to abandon their
)ose, but elected the person above-named, and under their

confirmed the said election.

However, on the bishop of Durham and Hubert Pitz-Walter
making complaint as to this illegal conduct on the part of the
canons, the duke gave orders that all things relative to the
church of York should be in the same state as they were on
the day on which his father had been living and dead ; and
accordingly the ecclesiastical rights of the archbishopric re-
turned into the hands of Hubert Fitz- "Walter and his deputies
as before, while the secular benefices of the said archbishop
returned into the charge of the servants of the duke.

In the same year, Geoffrey, bishop of Ely, departed this
life at "Winchester, on the twelfth day before the calends
of September, and being carried to Ely was buried there ;
on which duke Richard took possession of all his treasures.
The said duke also sent his bishops, earls, and barons to all
the treasuries of the king, his father, and caused all the trea-
sures found, consisting of gold and silver, to be counted and
weighed ; the number and weight of which it would be tedious
to mention, inasmuch as this amount of treasure far exceeded
in tale and weight one hundred thousand marks. After
this, he sent his servants and bailiffs throughout all the sea-
ports of England, Normandy, Poitou, and others of his lands,
and caused the largest and best of all the ships to be selected
for himself, which were able to carry large freights, and then
distributed some of them among those of his friends who had
assumed the cross for the purpose of setting out for Jerusalem,
while the others were reserved for his own use.

The duke then came to London, the archbishops, bishops,
earls, and barons, and a vast multitude of knights, coming
thither to meet him ; by whose consent and advice he was
consecrated and crowned king of England, at Westminster,
in London, on the third day before the nones of September,
being the Lord's Day and the feast of the ordination of Saint
Gregory, the pope (the same being also an ^Egyptian day 21 ),
by Baldwin, archbishop of Canterbury, who was assisted at
the coronation by Walter, archbishop of Rouen, John, arch-
bishop of Dublin, Formalis, archbishop of Treves, Hugh,
bishop of Durham, Hugh, bishop of Lincoln, Hugh, bishop of
Chester, William, bishop of Hereford, William, bishop of

A.D. 1189. THE CORONATION OF KING RICHARD. 117

Worcester, John, bishop of Exeter, Eeginald, bishop of Bath,
John, bishop of Norwich, Sefrid, bishop of Chichester, Gilbert,
bishop of Rochester, Peter, bishop of Saint David's, the bishop
of Saint Asaph, the bishop of Bangor, Albinus, bishop of
Ferns, and Concord, bishop of Aghadce, while nearly all the
abbats, priors, earls, and barons of England were present.

The Order of the Coronation of Richard, King of England.

First came the bishops, abbats, and large numbers of the
clergy, wearing silken hoods, preceded by the cross, taper-bearers,
censers, and holy water, as far as the door of the king's inner
chamber ; where they received the before-named duke, and es-
corted him to the church of Westminster, as far as the high altar,
in solemn procession, with chaunts of praise, while all the way
along which they went, from the door of the king's chamber to the
altar, was covered with woollen cloth. The order of the procession
was as follows : First came the clergy in their robes, carrying
holy water, and the cross, tapers, and censers. Next came
the priors, then the abbats, and then the bishops, in the midst
of whom walked four barons, bearing four candlesticks of
gold ; after whom came Godfrey de Lucy, bearing the king's cap
[of maintenance], and John Marshal by him, carrying two
great and massive spurs of gold. After these came William
Marshal, earl of Striguil, bearing the royal sceptre of gold,
on the top of which was a cross of gold, and by him William
Fitz-Patrick, earl of Salisbury, bearing a rod of gold, having
on its top a dove of gold. After them came David, earl
of Huntingdon, brother of the king of Scotland, John,
earl of Mortaigne, the duke's brother, and Robert, earl of
Leicester, carrying three golden swords from the king's
treasury, the scabbards of which were worked all over with
gold ; the earl of Mortaigne walking in the middle. Next
came six earls and six barons, carrying on their shoulders a
very large chequer, upon which were placed the royal arms
and robes ; and after them William de Mandeville, earl of
Aumarle, carrying a great and massive crown of gold, deco-
rated on every side with precious stones. Next came Richard,
duke of Normandy, Hugh, bishop of Durham, walking at his
right hand, and Reginald, bishop of Bath, at his left, and
four barons holding over them a canopy of silk on four lofty
spears . Then iollowed a great number of earls, barons,

knights, and others, both clergy and laity, as far as the porch of
the church, and dressed in their robes, entered with the duke,
and proceeded as far as the choir.

When the duke had coine to the altar, in presence of the
archbishops, bishops, clergy, and people, kneeling before the
altar, with the holy Evangelists placed before him, and many
relics of the saints, according to custom, he swore that he
would all the days of his life observe peace, honor, and reverence
towards God, the Holy Church, and its ordinances. He also
swore that he would exercise true justice and equity towards
the people committed to his charge. He also swore that he
would abrogate bad laws and unjust customs, if any such had
been introduced into his kingdom, and would enact good laws,
and observe the same without fraud or evil intent. After this
they took off all his clothes from the waist upwards, except
his shirt and breeches ; his shirt having been previously separated
over the shoulders ; after which they shod him with sandals em-
broidered with gold. Then Baldwin, archbishop of Canterbury,
pouring holy oil upon hishead, anointed him king in three places,
on his head, breast, and arms, which signifies glory, valour, and
knowledge, with suitable prayers for the occasion ; after which
the said archbishop placed a consecrated linen cloth on his
head, and upon that the cap which Geoffrey de Lucy had
carried. They then clothed him in the royal robes, first a tunic,
and then a dalmatic ; after which the said archbishop delivered
to him the sword of rule, with which to crush evil-doers
against the Church : this done, two earls placed the spurs
upon his feet, which John Marshal had carried. After this,
being robed in a mantle, he was led to the altar, where the
said archbishop forbade him, in the name of Almighty God, to
presume to take upon him this dignity, unless he had the full
intention inviolably to observe the oaths and vows before-
mentioned which he had made ; to which he made answer that,
with God's assistance, he would without reservation observe
them all. After this, he himself took the crown from the altar
and gave it to the archbishop ; on which, the archbishop de-
livered it to him, and placed it upon his head, it being
supported by two earls in consequence of its extreme weight.
After this, the archbishop delivered to him the sceptre to hold
in his right hand, while he held the rod of royalty in his left ;
and, having been thus crowned, the king was led back to his
seat by the before-named bishops of Durham and Bath, pre-

ceded by the taper-bearers and the three swords before-men-
tioned. After this, the mass of our Lord was commenced, and,
when they came to the offertory, the before-named bishops led
him to the altar, where he offered one mark of the purest gold,
such being the proper offering for the king at each coronation ;
after which, the bishops before-named led him back to his seat.
The mass having been concluded, and all things solemnly per-
formed, the two bishops before-named, one on the right hand
the other on the left, led him back from the church to his
chamber, crowned, and carrying a sceptre in his right hand and
the rod of royalty in his left, the procession going in the same
order as before. Then the procession returned to the choir,
and our lord the king put off his royal crown and robes of
royalty, and put on a crown and robes that were lighter ; and,
thus crowned, went to dine ; on which the archbishops and
bishops took their seats with him at the table, each according
to his rank and dignity. The earls and barons also served in
the king's palace, according to their several dignities ; while
the citizens of London served in the cellars, and the citizens
of Winchester in the kitchen.

While the king was seated at table, the chief men of
the Jews came to offer presents to him, but as they had
been forbidden the day before to come to the king's court on
the day of the coronation, the common people, with scornful
eye and insatiable heart, rushed upon the Jews and stripped
them, and then scourging them, cast them forth out of the
king's hall. Among these was Benedict, a Jew of York, who,
after having been so maltreated and wounded by the Christians
that his life was despaired of, was baptized by William, prior
of the church of Saint Mary at York, in the church of the
Innocents, and was named William, and thus escaped the peril
of death and the hands of the persecutors.

The citizens of London, on hearing of this, attacked the
Jews in the city and burned their houses ; but by the kindness
of their Christian friends, some few made their escape. On
the day after the coronation, the king sent his servants, and
caused those offenders to be arrested who had set fire to the
city; not for the sake of the Jews, but on account of the houses
and property of the Christians which they had burnt and
plundered, and he ordered some of them to be hanged.

On the same day, the king ordered the before-named William,
who from a Jew had become a Christian, to be presented to



120 ANNALS OF EOGEE DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1189.

him, on which he said to him, " What person are you ?" to
which he made answer, " I am Benedict of York, one of your
Jews." On this the king turned to the archbishop of Canter-
bury, and the others who had told him that the said Benedict
had become a Christian, and said to them, " Did you not tell
me that he is a Christian ?" to which they made answer,
" Yes, my lord.'' Whereupon he said to them, " What are we
to do with him ?" to which the archbishop of Canterbury, less
circumspectly than he might, in the spirit of his anger, made
answer, " If he does not choose to be a Christian, let him be a
man of the Devil ;" whereas he ought to have made answer,
" We demand that he shall be brought to a Christian trial, as
he has become a Christian, and now contradicts that fact."
But, inasmuch as there was no person to offer any opposition
thereto, the before-named William relapsed into the Jewish
errors, and after a short time died at Northampton ; on which
he was refused both the usual sepulture of the Jews, as also
that of the Christians, both because he had been a Christian,
and because he had, "like a dog, returned to his vomit." 22

On the second day after his coronation, Richard, king of
England, received the oaths of homage and fealty from the
bishops, abbats, earls, and barons of England. After this was
done, the king put up for sale every thing he had, castles,
vills, and estates. Accordingly, Hugh, bishop of Durham,
bought of the king his good manor of Sedbergh, 23 with the
Wapentake and knight's fees thereof, for six hundred marks of
silver, by way of a pure and perpetual alms ; and the said pur-
chase was confirmed by charter to the following effect :

The Charter of king Richard, confirming the sale of the Manor of

Sedbergh to JIugh, bishop of Durham.

Eichard, by the grace of God, king of England, duke of
Normandy and Aquitaine, and earl of Anjou, to the arch-
bishops, bishops, [earls], barons, sheriffs, and all his bailiffs
and servants throughout all England, greeting. Know ye that
we have given and granted, and by this present charter do
confirm to God, and to Saint Cuthbert and the church of
Durham, and to Hu.gh, bishop of Durham, our dearly beloved
cousin, and to his successors, as a pure and perpetual alms for
the soul of our father, as also of our predecessors and successors,
and for the salvation of ourselves and of our heirs, and for the

establishment and increase of our kingdom, our manor of
Sedbergh, together with the Wapentake to the said manor be-
longing, and all other things thereto appurtenant, both men,
and lands, sown and unsown, ways, paths, meadows, pastures,
ponds, mills, waters, piscaries, as also the services of Peter
Carou, and his heirs, for one knight's fee, held at Seton and
Oviton ; the services of Thomas de Amudeville, and his heirs,
for one knight's fee, at Cotton and Treyford ; and the services
of Godfrey Baarde, and his heirs, for two halves of one knight's
fee, at Middleton and Hartburn, which lands they held of us
between the Tyne and the Tees, together with all other things
to the aforesaid fees pertaining, in exchange for the services of
three knight's fees, which Philip de Kimber has held of the said
bishop in Lincolnshire, and two knights' fees which Gerard de
Camville has also there held of the said bishop, and one knight's
fee which Baldwin Wake and Roger Fitz-Oseville also held
there of the same bishop. Therefore we do will and command
that the before-named Hugh, bishop of Durham, and his succes-
sors, shall have, hold, and enjoy, freely, quietly, and with all
due honor, the said two knights' fees and the said two halves of
one knight's fee, together with the before-mentioned manor of
Sedbergh and the Wapentake as hereinbefore named, with all
things thereto pertaining in wood and plain, with soc, and sac,
and tol, and them, and infangtheof, and with all other liberties
and free customs, and with the pleas belonging to the crown,
in such manner as we hold the same in our own hands, and in
such manner as the said bishop has and holds the other lands
and knights' fees in his bishopric, and so that the said bishop,
us also his successors, may dispose of the men and lands to the
same manor pertaining according to his own pleasure and free
will, in such manner as he does with respect to his other men
and lands in the said bishopric. Witnesses hereto : Baldwin,
archbishop of Canterbury, Walter, archbishop of Rouen, John,
archbishop of Dublin, Reginald, bishop of Bath, Hugh, bishop
of Lincoln, John, bishop of Norwich, Hugh, bishop of Coventry,
Sefrid, bishop of Chichester, Gilbert, bishop of Rochester, John,
bishop of Exeter, the lord John, brother of our lord the king,
William de Mandeville, earl of Essex, Robert, earl of Leicester,
Hamelin, earl of Warenne, Waleran, earl of Warwick, William,
earl of Arundel, Richard, earl of Clare, William, earl of Salis-
bury, Roger Bigot, William Marshal, lord of Striguil. Given in
the first year of our reign, on the eighteenth day of September,

at Eatingert, by the hand of William de Longchamp, our
chancellor."

Also the said bishop gave to the before-named king

marks of silver for receiving the earldom of Northumberland
for life, together with its castles and other appurtenances.

After this, the king proceeded to an abbey called Pipewell, 24
where he was met by the following persons : Baldwin, arch-
bishop of Canterbury, Walter, archbishop of Rouen, John,
archbishop of Dublin, Eormalis, archbishop of Treves, Hugh,
bishop of Durham, Hugh, bishop of Lincoln, Hugh, bishop of
Chester, John, bishop of Norwich, John, bishop of Evreux,
John, bishop of Exeter, William, bishop of Hereford, William,
bishop of Worcester, Reginald, bishop of Bath, Gilbert, bishop
of Rochester, Sefrid, bishop of Chichester, Henry, bishop of
Bayeux, Peter, bishop of Saint David's, in Wales, Albinus,
bishop of Eerns, Concord, bishop of Aghadoe, together with
nearly all the abbats and priors of England. Here the king gave
to Godfrey de Lucy the bishopric of Winchester ; to Richard,
archdeacon of Ely, his treasurer, the bishopric of Lincoln ; and
to Hubert Eitz- Walter, dean of York, the bishopric of Salis-
bury; the abbey of Selesby 26 to Roger, prior of that abbey;
the abbey of Glastonbury to Henry de Soilly, prior of Ber-
mondsey ; and to Geoffrey, his brother, the former bishop- elect
of Lincoln, the archbishopric of York. To Henry, the brother
of William Marshal, he gave the deanery of York, and to
Bucard de Pudsey, nephew of Hugh, bishop of Durham, the
treasurership of the church of York. To William de Chuneli
he gave the archdeaconry of Richmond, and to William de
Saint Mary L'Eglise, the prebendal stall which had belonged to
Herbert Eitz- Walter in the church of York, with the deanery
of Saint Martin, at London.

When Baldwin, archbishop of Canterbury, saw that the
archbishopric of York had been given to the said Geoffrey,
he claimed the consecrating of him, and forbade that he
should receive consecration, or priest's orders, at the hands
of any one but himself, and appealed in the matter to our
lord the pope, producing before the king and all the bishops
and clergy, and people, the charter of king William the Bas-
tard, in which was stated the dispute which formerly took
place between the churches of Canterbury and York, with re-
spect to the primacy of England and certain other dignities.

In this charter also it was stated that Thomas, at that time
archbishop of York, had received priest's orders and episcopal
consecration at the hands of Lanfranc, at that time archbishop
of Canterbury and primate of all England, and paid to him
canonical obedience, and came to his synods with the bishop
of the church of Lindisfarne and his other suffragan bishops,
and showed him all respect as being his primate. This charter
also attested that all the above things had taken place before
king William, at the general council held at London, in ac-
cordance with the final sentence pronounced thereon by pope
Alexander the Second.

On the following day, John, bishop elect of Whitherne, was
consecrated bishop by John, archbishop of Dublin, at Pipewell,
it being the Lord's Day, and the fifteenth day before the
calends of October. At the same council also, our lord the
king appointed Hugh, bishop of Durham, and William, earl of
Aumarle, chief justiciaries of England, and associated with
them in the government of the kingdom William Marshal,
Geoffrey Eitz-Peter, William Bruyere, Eobert de Whitfield,
and Koger Fitz-Rainfray.

Geoffrey, the archbishop elect of York, immediately made
complaint against Henry, the brother of William Marshal,
Bucard, the nephew of Hugh, bishop of Durham, William de
Saint Mary L'Eglise, and Roger, abbat elect of the abbey of
Saint German, at Selby, on whom the king had conferred the
honors above-mentioned, and swore that these presentations of
the king should not hold good, unless with his consent and will.
In consequence of this, the king deprived him of the see of
York, and a great dissension arose between them, so much so,
that the king went so far even as to deprive him of all his pos-
sessions on either side of the sea. However, shortly after, the
said archbishop elect of York received priest's orders from John,
bishop of Whitherne, his suffragan, on the fourth day before
the calends of September, at Swale. 27

In the meantime, Richard, king of England, sending his
envoys to pope Clement, obtained from him letters patent, that
such persons as he should think fit to excuse and leave in charge
of his dominions, should be exempt from assuming the cross,
and proceeding to Jerusalem ; by which means he obtained an
immense sum of money.

Henry, the brother of William Marshal, to whom the king
had given the deanery of York, came to Burton, in Lindsey, and
there received orders as subdeacon and deacon on the same
day, from Concord, bishop of Aghadoe. But when the said
Henry came to York with the king's letters, in order to
receive his deanery, he found no one to instal him as dean :
as the clergy of the see of York asserted that no person but
the archbishop ought to instal him as dean. However, Hamo,
the praecentor of York, installed him in the prebendal stall
which the king had conferred on him : but when Bucard
de Pudsey, the archdeacon of Durham, to whom the king had
given the treasurership of the church of York, came with
the king's letters directed to Hamo the praecentor, requesting
him to instal the said Bucard, he was unwilling to obey the
king's commands. For he asserted that Roger, the archbishop
of York, had given to him the said treasurership, and that king
Henry had confirmed it to him ; and he appealed thereon to
the Apostolic See ; and thus, both missing the objects of their
desire, took their departure.

In the same year, Formator, 28 archbishop of Treves, departed
this life at Northampton, in England. In this year, also, in
the month of September, the men of London, and many others
who had taken ship on their way to Jerusalem, laid siege, in
Spain, to a certain city of the Saracens, which is called Silvia,
and took it ; and, after clearing it of the abominations of the
Saracens, they ordained that the Christian law should be there
observed for ever, and built a church in honor of God and Saint
Mary, the Mother of God, and caused it to be dedicated by the
neighbouring bishops, and had a certain clerk of Flanders, who
had come with them, consecrated bishop of the said city, and
then delivered it up to Sancho, king of Portugal.

In the same year, Godfrey de Lucy, bishop of Winchester,
purchased of Richard, king of England, two excellent manors,
namely, Wargrave and Menes, which formerly belonged to
the bishop of Winchester, as was generally said ; and Samson,
abbat of Saint Edmund's, bought of him the manor which is
called Mildenhall, for a thousand marks, and which, of ancient
right, was said to belong to the abbey of Saint Edmund's. All
the rest as well, whoever chose, bought of the king their own
rights and those of others ; by which the king acquired a very
large sum of money.

Geoffrey, the archbishop elect, coming to York, was received
with a solemn procession by the clergy and people. There
came also to York, Henry, the brother of William Marshal,
to whom the king had given the deanery of York, and Bucard,
the nephew of Hugh, bishop of Durham, to whom the king
had given the treasurership of York ; but the archbishop of
York refused to receive or instal them, declaring that he would
not do so until such time as his election had been confirmed
by the Supreme Pontiff.

In the same year, in the month of October, Henry, duke of
Saxony, the son-in-law of Henry, king of England, returned to
Saxony, his own country, and, having levied a large army, at-
tacked those to whom the emperor had given his territories,
and defeated them, taking more than thirty castles. In the
same year, in the month of November, William de Mandeville,
earl of Aumarle, died at Rouen, in Normandy, and Hugh de
Pudsey, count de Bar sur Seine, nephew of Hugh, bishop of
Durham, died at Aclea, and was buried in the place at Durham
which is called the Galilee. 29

In the same month, Eotrod, count de Perche, and other en-
voys of Philip, king of France, came into England, to Richard,
king of England, to say that, at a general council held at Paris,
the king of Trance, touching the Holy Evangelists, had made
oath, as had all the chief men of his kingdom who had as-
sumed the cross, that, God willing, they would, without fail,
be at Vezelay, at the close of Easter, for the purpose of setting
out for Jerusalem ; and, in testimony of the said oath, the king
of France sent to the king of England his letters, requesting
of him that he and his earls and barons would in like manner
give him assurance that, at the same period, tifey would be at
Vezelay.

Accordingly, Richard, king of England, and his earls and
barons who had assumed the cross, met at a general council at
London ; and, touching the Holy Evangelists, made oath that,
with the help of God, they would, without fail, be at Vezelay
at the close of Easter, prepared to set out thence for Jerusalem ;
upon which the before-named count de Perche, and the other
envoys of the king of France, made oath, at the council, upon
the soul of the king of France, in presence of the king of Eng-
land, to the same effect, and William Marshal and some others

29 A portion of the cathedral, at the east end of it, overlooking the
banks of the Wear.



126 ANNALS OF B.OGEB DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1189.

made oath at the same council to the like effect, upon the soul
of the king of England, in presence of the envoys of the king
of France ; and the king of England sent to the king of Prance
his agreement binding himself so to do.

In the same year, Sibylla, queen of Jerusalem, gave Ascalon
to Saladin, as the ransom of her husband, Guido de Lusignan ;
on which Saladin set him at liberty, and gave him leave to
depart, with a safe conduct as far as the city of Tyre ; on his
arrival at which place, the marquis Conrad would not allow
him to enter. Consequently, the king, having no place where
to lay his head, remained outside of the city of Tyre in his
tents ; on which, there flocked to him the Templars and Hos-
pitallers, and all the Christians, who, through fear of the
pagans, had been dispersed in that neighbourhood, and gave in
their adhesion to him as their lord and king.

Upon this, king Guido, by the advice of Heraclius, the Pa-
triarch of Jerusalem, and of those who were with him, set
out on his way to the city of Acre, to which he laid siege, at
a spot which is called [Mount] Turon, in the month of August,
on the octave of the Assumption of Saint Mary, that is to
say, on the eleventh day before the calends of September ; but,
as the king had but a small army, the pagans, who were in
the city of Acre, did not shut the gates of the city either
by day or night, but went to and fro, with their camels,
carrying provisions and other things that were necessary to
them.

On the third day after, there landed at Acre, Robert, count de
Drues, and his brother Philip, bishop of Beauvais, count Erard
de Breines, an<J Jacques d'Avennes, with the landgrave of Ger-
many, and many other Christian pilgrims, at whose arrival the
king, and all who were with him, greatly rejoiced, with exceed-
ing gladness. Accordingly, Saladin, after levying a large
army, approached the army of the Christians, and fought a
battle with them, on the fourth day of the week, being the
day after the feast of Saint Michael, on the plain between
Acre and Casale 1'Eveque, in which battle Saladin was de-
feated and put to flight, so that he left all his tents in the
hands of the Christians, and lost one half of his best troops ;
the Christians also lost a great part of theirs.

After a time, in consequence of their sinfulness, Saladin
again got the better of the Christians, who were repulsed and
driven to their camp, and Gerard de Bedford, the Grand Master



A.D. 1189. THE MANNER OF THE SIEGE OF ACEE. 127

of the Temple, and the Marshal of the Temple, with eighteen of
the brethren, who had behaved most valiantly, were slain ; the
Christians also lost many other soldiers, and among them forty
knights and one hundred Turcopoles. 31 Saladin, however, lost
Mirsalim, his eldest son, and his nephew Tekehedin, Migemal,
his seneschal, and a hundred of the choicest of his troops, be-
sides many others, whose numbers were not ascertained. On
the fourth day of the week, Saladin again approached with his
army; but when the Christians showed a readiness to engage
with him, he hastily retreated, and, on the third day after,
shifted his camp, and hastened to a place which has the name
of Saftan, while his army occupied the whole space that lies
between Casale TEveque and Docus ; as, from the time that
Saladin was born, he had never levied such a mighty army
as this. For, throughout the whole of his territories, there
was not a person fitted for war who was not included in this
army. Nor do I believe that any person could ever have set
eyes upon so large and so valiant a band of Christians as he
might have seen on this occasion. In addition to this, after the
battle was over, there arrived five hundred most valiant Chris-
tian knights and ten thousand men, brave warriors, well pro-
vided with all kinds of arms. In the same year, also, there
came to those shores ships and busses, 32 more than five hundred
in number, besides numerous galleys and cutters, which imme-
diately returned to Apulia, that they might bring further
supplies of men and provisions. The ships, however, of the
Germans and of the Danes remained at Acre, for the purpose
of fuel : as the Christians there had no fuel with which to
cook their food, except such as the ships had brought, and the
ships themselves.

It deserves to be described how the city of Acre was be-
sieged ; Guido, king of Jerusalem, with the queen, his wife,
and his two daughters, was lodged at Turon, looking towards
the sea, and near the summit of the mountain, Heraclius,
the Patriarch, and Geoffrey, the king's brother, being with
him. The whole sea-line, which extends to Caiaphas, was

that they took their name from the English word "buss," signify-
ing " a box." It has been, however, suggested that they were so called

called jftfrgto*

occupied by the camp of the Pisans, so much so, that no one
could escape from the city on that side. On the other side of
[Mount] Turon, where Maconiatum is situate (called Lama-
humheria by the Saracens), the lord landgrave and the said
Jacques de Avennes, and all the Germans and the Genevese,
had pitched their tents. Beyond these, the Temple with its
brotherhood took up its quarters at the spot where were the
gardens and the Tanks of the Latins. The Hospital, with
its brethren and people, pitched its camp on the spot where
were the gardens and land of the said Hospital. In the other
direction, the whole space, as far as the sea, was occupied by
the marquis Conrad, and many of the people from beyond
the Alps, quite as far as Mount Musard. Count Robert de
Drues, 33 the bishop of Beauvais, and the count Erard de Breines,
as also the Franks and Campanians, together with the king's
people, took up their quarters towards Mount Turon, and
near the town; the archbishop of Pisa, the archbishop of
Nazareth, the archbishop of Besanson, the archbishop of Arles-
le-blanc, and the archbishop of Montreal being with them.

The Christians next made a large trench from sea to sea, 34
where the foss of the Temple was already in existence, lying
between them and the army of the pagans. They also made
another trench between themselves and Acre, so that they were
in no fear of assault from the persons in Acre, and none of
the pagans could go forth from Acre without falling into their
hands. The engines also and stone batteries of the Christians
were masked behind them, so that no one could do them any
injury from the opposite side ; but the Christians there were
exposed to the winds and rain, having neither houses nor
cabins in which to shelter themselves ; nor indeed, if they had
sworn so to do, could they have retreated, but there they must
live or die. In this way, as previously mentioned, was siege
on all sides laid to Acre ; so strictly that no person whatever
could possibly escape therefrom, while day after day they made
assaults against it.

On the other hand, on one side of the Christians was Acre,
full of pagan warriors, and on the other was Saladin with his
mighty army. And, with all truth do I assert it, never were
the Christians in a similar position, or one full of such anxious

expectation, as no provisions could be brought them but by sea.
In the meanwhile, prayers were put up for them without
ceasing by the Church to the Lord.

In the same year, in the month of October, Baldwin,
archbishop of Canterbury, consecrated Godfrey, bishop of Win-
chester, William, bishop of Ely, Hubert, bishop of Salisbury,
and Richard, bishop of London. In the same month Rees, the
son of Griffin, 35 king of South Wales, came into England as far
as Oxford, under the safe conduct of John, earl of Mortaigne,
the king's brother ; but because the king of England declined
to come to meet him, he was greatly indignant, and returned
to his country without an interview with the king.

In the same year, in the month of November, cardinal John
of Anagni, who had been sent as legate a latere by our lord
the pope to put an end to the disputes which existed be-
tween Baldwin, archbishop of Canterbury, and the monks
of the Holy Trinity at Canterbury, landed at Dover, in Eng-
land; on which he was forbidden to proceed any further with-
out the king's command, and, accordingly, he remained there
till our lord the king sent for him. In the meantime, our lord
the king went to Canterbury, and made peace and a final recon-
ciliation between Baldwin, archbishop of Canterbury, and the
monks, on the following terms : Roger le Norreys, whom the be-
fore-named archbishop, against the wishes of the monks, had
made prior of the church of Canterbury, was to be deprived of
the office, and the church, 36 which the said bishop had built in the
suburbs against the wish of the monks, was to be pulled down,
while the monks were to pay canonical obedience and make pro-
fession thereof to the said archbishop, in the same manner in
which they had been accustomed to do to his predecessors. Thus
were matters arranged ; and, at the prayer of the archbishop of
Canterbury, our lord the king gave to the before-named prior,
after his deposition, the abbacy of Evesham, and he was ele-
vated to the rank of abbat thereof. The archbishop also placed
a prior over the church of Canterbury with the king's assent,
and with the sanction of the chapter. The monks of Canterbury,
however, after the death of that archbishop, deposed him. In the
meantime, the archbishop built a church at Lamhe, 37 opposite
to Westminster, and the prebends which he had given to the

35 Rice ap Griffydd. 36 Akington or Hackington church, pre-

viously mentioned. See p. 69. 37 Lambeth.

130 ANNALS OF EOGER DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1189.

church built by him in the suburbs of the city of Canterbury,
he gave to this new church which he had built at Lambeth.

At this treaty of peace and final reconciliation there were pre-
sent Richard, king of England, and queen Eleanor, his mother,
"Walter, archbishop of Rouen, John, archbishop of Dublin,
Hugh, bishop of Durham, John, bishop of Norwich, Hubert, 38
bishop of Salisbury, Godfrey, bishop of Winchester, Gilbert,
bishop of Rochester, Reginald, bishop of Bath, Hugh, bishop
of Coventry, Hugh, bishop of Lincoln, William, bishop of
Worcester, the abbat of Saint Augustin's at Canterbury, Bene-
dict, abbat of Burgh, Sampson, abbat of Saint Edmund's, the
abbat of Battle, the abbat of Westminster, Guarine, abbat of
Saint Alban's, and many other priors and abbats, all of whom
set their seals to the writing in which was set forth the said
agreement.

After this, the king sent for cardinal John of Anagni, who
came to Canterbury, and was received with a solemn proces-
sion, but was greatly offended that in his absence a reconcili-
ation had been effected between the archbishop of Canterbury
and his monks.

In the same year, in the month of November, Geoffrey, the
archbishop elect of York, together with the barons of York-
shire, and the sheriff of York, by command of our lord the king,
went as far as the river Tweed, and there received William,
king of the Scots, and paid him all due honor, and gave him a
safe conduct to the king of England. Accordingly, William,
king of the Scots, came to the king of England at Canterbury
in the month of December, and did homage to him for his
dignities in England, in the same manner that his brother
Malcolm had held them. Richard, king of England, also
restored to him the castle of Roxburgh and the castle of Ber-
wick, freely and quietly to be held by him ; and he acquitted and
released him and all his heirs from all homage and allegiance,
for the kingdom of Scotland, to him and the kings of England,
for ever. For this gift of his castles and for quitting claim
to all fealty and allegiance for the kingdom of Scotland, and
for the charter of Richard, king of England, signifying the
same, William, king of the Scots, gave to Richard, king of
England, ten thousand marks sterling. The charter, executed
by the king of England, was to the following effect :

A. D. 1189. CHAETEB, OF THE KING OF ENGLAND. 131

The Charter of the Icing of England as to the liberties granted ly
him to William, king of Scotland.

" Richard, by the grace of God, king of England, duke of
Normandy and Aquitaine, and earl of Anjou, to the arch-
bishops, bishops, abbats, earls, barons, justices, and sheriffs,
and all his servants and faithful people throughout the whole
of England, greeting. Know ye that we have restored to our
most dearly-beloved cousin William, by the same grace king
of the Scots, his castles of Roxburgh and Berwick, to be held
by him and his heirs for ever as his own of hereditary right.
"We have also acquitted and released him of and from all cove-
nants and agreements which Henry, king of England, our father,
of happy memory, extorted from him by new charters, and in
consequence of his capture ; upon condition, however, that he
shall in all things do unto us as fully as Malcolm, king of the
Scots, his brother, did as of right unto our predecessors, and of
right was bound to do. We likewise will do for him whatever of
right our predecessors did and were bound to do for the said
Malcolm, both in his coming with a safe-conduct to our court,
and in his returning from our court, and while he is staying
at our court, and in making all due provision for him, and ac-
cording to him all liberties, dignities, and honors due to him as
of right, according as the same shall be ascertained by four of
our nobles who shall be selected by the said king William, and
four of his nobles who shall be selected by us. And if any one
of our subjects shall, since the time when the said king Wil-
liam was taken prisoner by our father, have seized upon any
of the borders or marches of the kingdom of Scotland, without
the same being legally adjudicated to him ; then we do will
that the same shall be restored to him in full, and shall be
placed in the same state in which they were before he was
so taken prisoner. Moreover, as to his lands which he may
hold in England, whether in demesne or whether in fee, that
is to say in the county of Huntingdon, and in all other coun-
ties, he and his heirs shall hold the said counties as fully and
freely for ever as the said Malcolm held or ought to have held
the same, unless the said Malcolm or his heirs shall have since
enfeoffed any one of the same ; on the further condition also that
if any one shall be hereafter enfeoffed of the same, the services
of the said fees shall belong to him or his heirs. And if our
said father shall have given anything to. William, king of the
Scots, we do will that the same shall be hereby ratified and con-

firmed. We have also restored to him all allegiances of his
subjects and all charters which the king our father obtained
of him by reason of his capture. And if any other charters
shall chance, through forgetfulness, to have been retained by
us or shall hereafter be found, we do hereby order that the
same shall be utterly void and of no effect. He has also be-
come our liegeman as to all the lands for which his prede-
cessors were liegemen to our predecessors, and has sworn fealty
to ourselves and to our heirs. The following being witnesses
hereto: Baldwin, archbishop of Canterbury, Walter, arch-
bishop of Kouen, Hugh, bishop of Durham, John, bishop of
Norwich, Hubert, bishop of Salisbury, Hugh, bishop of Lincoln,
Godfrey, bishop of Winchester, Gilbert, bishop of Rochester,
Reginald, bishop of Bath, Hugh, bishop of Coventry, William,
bishop of Worcester, Eleanor, the king's mother, John, earl of
Mortaigne, the king's brother, and many others."

On the same day, there came thither, namely, to Canter-
bury, Hugh, bishop of Durham, and Hubert, bishop of Salis-
bury, to appeal to the presence of our lord the pope, against
Geoffrey, the archbishop elect of York, before the said cardinal
and the above-named archbishops and bishops, wishing to
prove that his election ought not to hold good, because they
themselves to whom the first votes in the election belonged were
not present at his said election. Bucard also, the treasurer of
the church of York, and Henry, the dean of the said church,
appealed against the said archbishop elect of York to the pre-
sence of our lord the pope, affirming that he was not canoni-
cally elected, and was a murderer, born in adultery, and the
son of a harlot. But although all these allegations were made
against him, the before-named cardinal John of Anagni, the
legate of the Apostolic See, confirmed his election.

After this, Richard, king of England, gave to his brother
John, earl of Mortaigne, by way of augmentation, the earldoms
of Cornwall, Devon. 39 Dorset, and Somerset. The king of
England also gave to his mother, queen Eleanor, the whole of
the dower which queen Matilda, the wife of king Henry the
Elder, 40 had enjoyed, the whole of the dower which Alice, the
wife of king Stephen, enjoyed, and the whole of the dower
which Henry, king of England, son of the empress Matilda,
had given to her.

39 These have been previously mentioned as given to him, except that
of the county of Devon, See p. 115 of this Volume. * Henry the First.



A.D. 1189. KING EICHARD SAILS FOE CALAIS. 133

King Richard departed from the city of Canterbury, on the
fifth day of December, for Dover, in order to cross over ; for
there many ships had assembled by his command from different
parts of England. On the day after his arrival at Dover, Roger,
the abbat elect of Saint German's, at Selby, received his bene-
diction at Dover, on Saint Nicholas' day, from Hugh, bishop of
Durham, by the king's command, notwithstanding the prohi-
bition of Geoffrey, archbishop elect of York,

On this, Geoffrey, the archbishop elect of York, becoming
sensible that without the intervention of money he would in
nowise be able to gain his brother's favour, promised him three
thousand pounds sterling, for the purpose of so ingratiating him-
self ; on which, the king restored to him the archbishopric of
York, and confirmed the same to him by his charter, and restored
to him all the lay fees which king Henry, his father, had given
him, on either side of the sea ; namely, in England, the vill
of "Wycombe, with its appurtenances, the county of Giffard,
in Normandy, and in Anjou, the honor of Blauge, with its
appurtenances. The said king also released to God and Saint
Peter of York, and to the said Geoffrey, archbishop elect of
York, and to all that were able to succeed him in the arch-
bishopric of York, all his lands and those of his canons in
York and Nottingham for ever, both from forestal regard, 41
and all other demands and impositions of forest and foresters,
and gave them free power, and by his charter confirmed the
same, to take venison throughout all their prebends in York-
shire and Nottinghamshire.

In addition to this, Hugh, bishop of Durham, Hubert, bishop
of Salisbury, Henry, dean of the church of York, and Bucard,
treasurer of the same church,by the king's command, withdrew
the appeals which they had made against the said archbishop
elect of York ; and the said archbishop elect, at the king's
request, confirmed to the said Henry, the deanery of York,
and to Bucard, the treasurership ; and to Hugh, bishop of
Durham, he confirmed all the privileges and covenants which
had been made between the said bishop and Roger, archbishop
of York, and promised, by the seal of his consecration, that he
would confirm the same.

After these matters were arranged, Richard, king of Eng-

land, on the eleventh day of December, being the second day
of the week, crossed over from Dover to Calais, in Flanders,
whither Philip, earl of Flanders, came to meet him, and, re-
ceiving him with congratulations, escorted him with a safe
conduct to Normandy. There also crossed over with the king,
the cardinal John of Anagni, Walter, archbishop of Rouen,
Henry, bishop of Bayeux, and John, bishop of Evreux. Hugh,
bishop of Durham, and William, bishop of Ely, remained in
England as chief justiciaries ; with whom, before his de-
parture, the king had associated Hugh Bardolph, William
Marshal, Geoffrey Fitz-Peter, and William Bruyere. The
king also delivered to William, bishop of Ely, his chancellor,
one of his seals, by virtue of which he ordered his commands
to be carried out in his kingdom ; he also gave into his charge
the Tower of London. He also gave into the charge of Hugh,
bishop of Durham, the castle of Windsor, with the forests and
the earldom of the county.

Immediately after the king had passed over, a dispute arose
between the before-named bishops of Durham and Ely, which
of them was to occupy the highest place ; for the thing that
pleased the one, displeased the other. So true it is that " All
authority is impatient of a partner;" and, not to go further
for an illustration, " The first walls were steeped in a brother's
blood/' 43

In the month of November, in the same year, without issue,
died William, king of Sicily, the dukedom of Apulia, and the
principality of Capua, at Palermo, in Sicily. This William,
king of Sicily, a long time before his death, had given Con-
stance, the daughter of Roger, the former king of Sicily, his
aunt, in marriage to Henry, king of Germany, and afterwards
emperor of the Romans, and had made her his heir to succeed
him on the throne of Sicily, if he should die without issue ;
and this he caused to be confirmed by the oaths of the prin-
cipal men of the kingdom. However, on the death of king
William, Tancred, count de la Liche, his cousin, usurped the
kingdom of Sicily, contrary to the oath of fealty which he had
taken to the before-named Constance. On this, Henry, em-
peror of the Romans, sent a large army into Apulia, under the
command of the archbishop of Mentz and Henry Teste ; who,
after burning many cities, and overthrowing many towns,

Remus at the hands of his brother Romulus, or of Celer, his lieutenant, on

returned home without effecting their purpose. On their
withdrawal, Richard, count de Cirne, brother of the queen of
Sicily, the wife of king Tancred, made war upon count Roger
de Andria, on the ground, that he..had given aid to the king
of Germany against king Tancred, and took him prisoner, and
delivered him to king Tancred. Moreover, Joanna, the sister
of Rrcfeai?d, king of England, who had been the wife of Wil-
liam, king of Sicily, lately deceased, remained in the custody
of k^Bg^ancred:.' '

tiTtltg yV&Tof grace 1190, king Richard was at Burun, in
Normandy, on the day of the Nativity of our Lord, which took
place on the second day of the week, and kept that festival
there with the chief men of the territory ; for this Nativity of our
Lord was the first since the coronation of the said king. After
the Nativity, the said Richard, king of England, and Philip,
king of .France, held a conference at V Saint Remy, where
they agreed to a lasting peace between them and their re-
spective kingdoms, and, committing the treaty to writing,
ratified it by their oaths and seals, on the feast of Saint Hilary.
The archbishops and bishops also of both kingdoms agreed to the
same on their word of truth ; while the earls and barons of
those kingdoms made oath and swore that they would faith-
fully observe the said treaty of peace and keep the same un-
broken. The tenor of this treaty was to the effect that each
of them would maintain the honor of the other, and would
keep faith with him for life, limb, and worldly honor, and
that neither of them would forsake the other in the time of
need ; but that the king of France would aid the king of Eng-
land in defending his territories as he himself would defend his
own city of Paris, if it were besieged, and that Richard, king
of England, would aid the king of France in defending his ter-
ritories as he himself would defend his own city of Rouen, if it
were besieged. The earls and barons also of both kingdoms
made oath that they would not depart from their fealty to the
said kings or wage any war in their territories, so long as they
should be on their pilgrimage. The archbishops also and
bishops strictly promised, on their word of truth, that they would
pronounce sentence of excommunication against such as should
be guilty of a breach of the said treaty of peace and compact.

The said kings also made oath that if either of them should
die on the pilgrimage to Jerusalem, the one who should survive
should have the treasures and forces of him who had died,



136 ANNALS OF EOGEE BE HOVEDEtf. A.D 1190.

to employ the same in the service of God. And because they
could not be in readiness at Easter, the time previously ap-
pointed, they postponed setting out for Jerusalem till the feast
of the Nativity of Saint John the Baptist, determining that
then without fail they would be at Vezelay.

In the same year, on the vigil of the Epiphany of our Lord,
a great dissension arose between Geoffrey, archbishop elect of
York, and Henry, the dean of that church, and Bucard, the
treasurer. For the said archbishop elect having expressed
a desire to be present at vespers in the metropolitan church
on such a solemn occasion, the said Henry and Bucard would
not wait for him, but began vespers; consequently, when
the said archbishop elect came into the choir, together with
Hamo, the pracentor, and some other canons of the church,
he was greatly indignant thereat, and immediately ordered
silence, the praecentor ordering to the like effect ; while, on
the other hand, the dean and treasurer gave orders that they
should sing on ; however, in consequence of the orders of the
archbishop elect and prsecentor, all kept silence; on which
the archbishop elect was beginning vespers again, when the
treasurer ordered the tapers to be extinguished. These being
put out and the vespers brought to a close, the archbishop
elect complained before God, the clergy, and the people, of the
injury which the dean and treasurer had done him, and sus-
pended them and the church from the celebration of Divine
service, until such time as they should have given him satisfac-
tion for the same.

On the following day, when all the people of the city re-
sorted after their usual custom to the metropolitan church, that
there, on account of the solemnity of the day, they might more
becomingly hear Divine service, both the archbishop elect and
the said dean and treasurer ought to have been in the choir,
together with the canons of the said church, to make peace and
reconciliation between themselves; however, the dean and
treasurer refused to make any satisfaction to their archbishop
elect for such and so great a transgression, but spoke contemptu-
ously of him ; in consequence of which the populace were en-
raged against them, and were desirous to make an attack on
them, but the archbishop elect would not allow them. On this,
in great alarm, they fled from before the face of the people,
and one of them took refuge at the tomb of Saint William,
and the other betook himself to the house of the dean ; while



A.D. 1190. PEKSECUTION OP THE JEWS AT YOEK. 137

the archbishop elect pronounced them excommunicated. In
consequence of this, Divine service ceased from that day in the
metropolitan church.

In the same year, after the Purification of Saint Mary, queen
Eleanor, the mother of king Eichard, Alice, the sister of Philip,
king of France, Baldwin, archbishop of Canterbury, John,
bishop of Norwich, Hugh, bishop of Durham, Godfrey, bishop
of Winchester, Eeginald, bishop of Bath, William, bishop of
Ely, Hubert, bishop of Salisbury, Hugh, bishop of Chester,
Geoffrey, archbishop elect of York, and John, earl of Mortaigne,
the king's brother, by order of our lord the king crossed over
from England to Normandy ; and after holding a council with
them, our lord the king appointed William, bishop of Ely, his
chancellor, chief justiciary of England ; while he made Hugh,
bishop of Durham, justiciary from the river Humber to the
territory of the king of Scotland. He also compelled Geoffrey,
archbishop elect of York, and John, earl of Mortaigne, his bro-
thers, to make oath, touching the Holy Evangelists, that they
would not enter England for the next three years, except with
his permission. However, he immediately released his brother
John from the oath which he had made, and gave him per-
mission to return to England, after swearing that he would
faithfully serve him.

The king also sent to England William, bishop of Ely, his
chancellor, to make the preparations necessary for him and his
expedition ; and, as he wished to exalt him above all other per-
sons in his dominions, both clergy as well as laity, he sent envoys
to pope Clement, and prevailed upon him to entrust to the be-
fore-named chancellor the legateship of the whole of England
and Scotland. On the chancellor arriving in England, he caused
the Tower of London to be surrounded with a moat of very
great depth, hoping that so the river Thames might pass around
it. After this, the chancellor received, for the necessities of
our lord the king, from each city of England two palfreys and
two sumpter horses by way of aid ; from each abbey throughout
England one palfrey and one sumpter horse ; and from each of
the king's manors one palfrey and one sumpter horse

In the same month of March, on the seventeenth 43 day be-
fore the calends of April, being the sixth day before Palm
Sunday, the Jews of the city of York, in number five hundred
men, besides women and children, shut themselves up in the
43 A various reading has " the eighteenth."



138 AKSALS OF ROGER DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1190,

tower of York, with the consent and sanction of the keeper of
the tower, and of the sheriff, in consequence of their dread of
the Christians ; but when the said sheriff and the constable
sought to regain possession of it, the Jews refused to deliver it
up. In consequence of this, the people of the city, and the
strangers who had come within the jurisdiction thereof, at the
exhortation of the sheriff and the constable, with one consent
made an attack upon the Jews.

After they had made assaults upon the tower, day and night,
the Jews offered the people a large sum of money to allow them
to depart with their lives ; but this the others refused to re-
ceive. Upon this, one skilled in their laws arose and said :
" Men of Israel, listen to my advice. It is better that we
should kill one another, than fall into the hands of the enemies
of our law." Accordingly, all the Jews, both men as well as
women, gave their assent to his advice, and each master of a
family, beginning with the chief persons of his household, with
a sharp knife first cut the throats of his wife and sons and
daughters, and then of all his servants, and lastly his own.
Some of them also threw their slain over the walls among the
people ; while others shut up their slain in the king's house
and burned them, as well as the king's houses. Those who
Lad slain the others were afterwards killed by the people. In
the meantime, some of the Christians set fire to the Jews'
houses, and plundered them ; and thus all the Jews in the city
of York were destroyed, and all acknowledgments of debts due
to them were burnt.

In the same year died Isabella, queen of Trance, and
daughter of the earl of Hainault, before her husband Philip,
king of France, had set out for Jerusalem. In the same year,
the Annunciation of our Lord fell on Easter day, a thing that
had not happened for a long time previously. In the mean-
time, the king's envoys, whom he had sent to Rome to obtain
the legateship of England and Scotland for William, his chan-
cellor, returned to him with letters of our lord the pope relative
thereto. Accordingly, on the strength of his legateship, the
said bishop of Ely, legate of the Apostolic See, chancellor of
our lord the king, and justiciary of all England, oppressed the
clergy and the people, confounding right and wrong ; nor was
there a person in the kingdom who dared to offer resistance to
his authority, even in word.

After Easter, the said chancellor of the king came to York



A.D. 1190. ATTEMPT TO SEIZE THE BISHOP OF DUfiHAM. 139

with a great army, for the purpose of seizing those evil-doers
who had destroyed the Jews of that city ; and, on learning
that this had been done by command of the sheriff and the
keeper of the tower, he deprived them both of their offices ;
while he exacted of the citizens of the city a hundred hostages,
as security for their good faith and keeping the peace of the
king and the kingdom, and that they would take their trial in
the court of our lord the king for the death of the Jews. After
this, the said chancellor placed in charge of Osbert de Long-
champ, his brother, the jurisdiction of the county of York,
and ordered the castle, in the old castelry which William Rufus
had erected there, to be fortified. The knights, also, of that
county who would not come to make redress, he ordered to be
arrested.

The said chancellor, by virtue of his legateship, next sus-
pended the canons, vicars, and clerks of the church of Saint
Peter at York, because they had refused to receive him in solemn
^recession ; and laid the church itself under an interdict until
t j.e canons, vicars, and clerks of the church of Saint Peter should
come and throw themselves at his feet ; he also caused the
bells of that church to be laid upon the ground.

In the meantime, Richard, king of England, gave to Hugh,
bishop of Durham, leave to return to his country : who, on
m r ,ting the chancellor at the city of Ely, 44 presented to him
the king's letters, in which the king had appointed him justici-
ary from the river Humber to the territories of the king of Scot-
land; on which the chancellor made answer, that he would with
pleasure execute the king's commands, and took him with him
as far as Suwelle, 45 where he seized him, and kept him in cus-
tody until he had surrendered to him the castle of Windsor
and others which the king had delivered into his charge. In
addition to this, the bishop of Durham delivered to the chan-
cellor, Henry de Pudsey, his son, and Gilbert de la Ley, as
pledges that he would keep faith to the king and his king-
dom ; on which, the bishop of Durham, being liberated from
the custody of the chancellor, came to a vill of his, which
bears the name of Hoveden. 46 While the bishop was staying
at this place for some days, there came to Hoveden Osbert de
Longchamp, brother of the chancellor, and William de Stute-
ville, with a considerable body of armed people, intending, by

command of the chancellor, to seize the bishop ; however, the
bishop gave them security that he would not depart thence,
except with the permission of the king or of the chancellor.
Accordingly, the bishop of Durham sent messengers to the king
of England, to inform him of everything that had happened to
him through the chancellor.

In the meantime, the king of England marched into Gas-
cony, and laid siege to the castle of William de Chisi, and
took it ; on which he hanged William, the owner of the castle,
because he had plundered pilgrims from Saint Jago, 47 and other
persons, as they passed through his lands. After this, the
king of England proceeded to Chin on, in Anjou, where he
appointed Gerard, archbishop of Auxienne, Bernard, bishop of
Bayonne, Eobert de Sabul, Richard de Camville, and William
de Fortz de Oleron, chiefs and constables of the whole of his
fleet which was about to proceed to the land of Syria, and gave
them ordinances to the following effect : 48

The CJiarter of Richard, king of England, containing ordinances
for those who were about to proceed ly sea.

" Richard, by the grace of God, king of England, duke of
Normandy and Aquitaine, and earl of Anjou, to all his sub-
jects about to proceed by sea to Jerusalem, greeting. Know
ye, that we, with the common consent of fit and proper men,
have made the enactments under- written. Whoever shall slay
a man on ship-board, he shall be bound to the dead man and
thrown into the sea. If he shall slay him on land, he shall be
bound to the dead man and buried in the earth. If any one
shall be convicted, by means of lawful witnesses, of having
drawn out a knife with which to strike another, or shall
strike another so as to. draw blood, he shall lose his hand.
If, also, he shall give a blow with his hand, without shedding
blood, he shall be plunged in the sea three times. If any man
shall utter disgraceful language or abuse, or shall curse his com-
panion, he shall pay him an ounce of silver for every time he has
so abused him. A robber who shall be convicted of theft, shall

48 These are a small portion of what are known as the " Oleron Laws,"
from having been made by king Richard when his fleet was lying at
Oleron, an island at the mouth of the river Charente. They form the
basis of a large part of the sea-laws in use at the present day.

have his head cropped after the manner of a champion, 50 and
boiling pitch shall be poured thereon, and then the feathers
of a cushion shall be shaken 51 out upon him, so that he
may be known, and at the first land at which the ships
shall touch, he shall be set on shore. "Witness myself, at
Chinon."

The king also gave orders, in another writ of his, that all
his subjects who were about to proceed to sea should pay obe-
dience to the orders and commands of the before-named justices
of his fleet. After this, the king proceeded to Tours, and
there 52 received the scrip and staff of his pilgrimage from the
hands of William, archbishop of Tours; but it so happened
that, while the king was leaning on the staff, it broke asunder.

After this, the said king, and Philip, king of France, met
at Vezelay, where rests the body of Saint Mary Magdalen.
Here they stayed two days, and left the place on the octave
of the Nativity of Saint John the Baptist. WTien they had
arrived at the city of Lyons on the Rhone, after they with the
greater part of their households had passed over the bridge
across that river, the bridge, being thronged with men and
women, broke down, not without doing injury to great numbers.
Here also the two kings separated, in consequence of the mul-
titude of men who followed them, as one place was not suf-
ficient to hold them. Accordingly, the king of France, with his
troops, went on to Genoa, while the king of England pro-
ceeded with his to Marseilles.

A Lament on the Expedition to Jerusalem.
" Most grievous are the days which have come upon us, and
worthy to be graced with no white stone. For the woes have
ministered to our grief which Holy Jerusalem is known to

50 Champions, before commencing the combat, had the hair cut close,
probably for the purpose of offering no unfair advantage to the antatjo-
gonist, by reason of the length of the hair and the facilities thereby
offered for pulling them to the ground.

11 This is a very early instance of the practice of tarring and feathering.

52 Roger of Wendover says that he received it at Vezelay.

53 This lament consists of thirty-two monkish lines, in rhymes of four.
The first four will serve as a specimen :

" Graves nobis admodum dies effiuxere

fQui lapillis candidis digni non fuere.
Nam luctus materiam mala praebuere,
Quae sanctam Jerusalem constat sustinere."
is not improbable that this was a song generally sung by the Crusaders.

endure. For who can do other than grieve for the slaughter
of so many of the Saints, so many sacred houses of the Lord
profaned, princes led captive, dwellings destroyed, and nobles
hurled at the feet of slaves? And yet these things shall not
escape the eyes of Him who beholds them. The Lord, looking
on, has beheld the woes of our race, has heard the groans of
this innocent people, and has descended to crush the head of the
serpent. For the God of the Hebrews has aroused the Christian
princes and their knights to avenge the blood of his Saints, and
to succour the sons of the slain. The illustrious king of Eng-
land and the king of the Franks are onward marching with many
thousand men-at-arms. 'Tis a glorious sight to behold the band
of senators with the arms of justice and with the worshippers
of God. 51 'Tis more pleasing still to hear of Frederic, lord of
the empire of Home, joining them in war against the enemies
of the Cross, that he may restore his country to its ancient
glory. The Cross going before, they march on towards the
East, and all the West they lead on with them. An army
they lead that differs in language, rites, manners, and customs,
but fervent in the faith. That they may return victorious,
let us offer up our prayers to God ; that so, entering Jerusalem,
they may root out from the midst of the earth the Canaanite,
and expel the Jebusite, and so bear away the palm of Christian
prowess."

While Richard, king of England, was staying at Marseilles,
there came to him the messengers of Hugh, bishop of Durham ;
and, on hearing from him the injuries which the before-named
chancellor had inflicted on him, the king ordered the earldom
of Northumberland and the manor of Sedbergh to be delivered
to the bishop of Durham ; relative to which, the king gave him
his charter to the following effect :

65 Another Charter of Ricliard, Icing of England, as to the con-
veyance of Sedbergh to Iugh, the lord bishop of Durham.

"Richard, by the grace of God, king of England, duke of
Kormandy and Aquitaine, and earl of Anjou, to the arch-
bishops, bishops, abbats, earls, barons, sheriffs, and all his
servants and faithful people throughout the whole of England,
greeting. Know ye that we have given to God, and to Saint
Cuthbert and the church of Durham, and to Hugh, the bishop,

and his successors, for ever, the manor of Scdbergh, together
with the Wapentake and knights' fees which we formerly gave
him, and by our charter confirmed, by way of a pure and per-
petual alms, for six hundred marks, which he paid us. Where-
fore we do will and command that he shall freely, quietly, and
honorably enter upon and enjoy the said manor, together with
the said Wapentake and knights' fees, and all other its appur-
tenances, as a pure and perpetual alms, in such manner as is
set forth in our charters, which the said bishop now holds. We
do also will and grant, so far as relates to ourselves, that, if any
person shall use against him force or molestation in respect
hereof, contrary to the tenor of our charters and confirmations,
he shall incur the anger and curse of God and ourselves. Witness
myself, at Marseilles. "

When the king of England had waited eight days at Mar-
seilles, in hope and expectation from day to day of the arrival of
his fleet, finding himself deceived in his wishes, he hired ten
large busses and twenty well-armed galleys, and embarked on
board them with his household in sorrow and dejection, on
account of the delay of his fleet. Accordingly, on the seventh
day of August the king of England set sail from Marseilles,
in the galley Pombone, and passed by the island of Saint
Stephen and Aquila and Mont Noir, the island of Saint Hono-
ratus, the city of Nice, and the city of Yintimiglia. It deserves
to be known that between the city of Nice and that of Yinti-
miglia is the division of the territories of the king of Arragon
and of Italy.

After this, the king of England passed Santa Maria de FUBZ,
and Noli. On the thirteenth day of August the king of Eng-
land passed a castle which is called Swene, 55 and on the same
day arrived at Geneva, where he had an interview with the
king of France, who was lying ill at a house near the church
of Saint Laurence. On the fourteenth day of August the king
of England arrived at Portofino, it being the vigil of the
Assumption of Saint Mary, and there he stayed five days.
While he was there the king of France sent to ask him for
the loan of five galleys, on which the king of England offered
him three, which the king of France refused. On the nine-
teenth day of August he left Portofino, and came to Porto
Yenere, and on the day after arrived at the port of Pisa. Here
he was met by Walter, archbishop of Rouen, John, the bishop
Lj * Evreux, then lying ill in the city of Pisa.

On the twenty-first day of the month of August the king
of England passed by the island of Gorgona, and on the
twenty-second day of the month of August the king came to
Porto Baratto. On the twenty-third day of August, being
the vigil of Saint Bartholomew the Apostle, the king proceeded
two leagues by land, and a few knights with him, on hired
horses, and came to a port, near a castle, called Piombino, to
meet his galleys ; and here the king embarked on board the
galley of Fulk Rustac, in which he had not previously sailed.
Being gratified with a favourable wind, he next passed an island
which is called Eerraria, and another called Argentaria, as also
an island called Genit ; after which he arrived at a port called
Talemunde.

On the -twenty-fourth day of August the king came to a
port which is called Portocarrero, which lies midway between
Marseilles and Messina. On the same day the sails were split
of the galley on board of which the king was, on which he
again embarked on board the galley Pombone, and then passed
the city of Corneto, the city of Civita Yecchia, 56 and the place
which is called the Faro di Eoma; after which he entered
the Tiber. At the entrance of this river there is a fine tower,
but deserted, and there are also very considerable remains of
ancient walls. Here Octavianus, cardinal-bishop of Ostia, came
to meet him; to whom the king uttered many reproaches,
charging the Romans with simony, because they had agreed
to take seven hundred marks for the consecration of the bishop
of Le Mans, and fifteen hundred marks for the legateship of
the bishop of Ely, and a large sum of money that the arch-
bishop of Bordeaux might not be degraded, who was criminally
accused by his clergy.

On the twenty-sixth day of August the king passed by a
certain forest which is called Silvadena, in which there is a
marble road, made like a pavement, which extends through the
middle of the wood twenty-four miles, the wood abounding with
deer, roebuck, and fawns. On the same day the king passed
by a castle which is called IXettuno. Here is a quay which
was formerly covered with copper ; here also was the entrance
to a subterraneous passage, through which money brought from
all quarters was conveyed to Rome. After this, the king
passed by a castle which is called Estura. On the twenty-

56 This place can be but faintly recognised under the name given in the
text, " Senes la Veile."

seventh day of August the king passed by a rock projecting
into the sea, which is called the Capo di Cercel, 66 and an
island called Parmerola, and another island called Ponza, and
another called Palmera. On the top of the mountain called
Capo di Cercel, is a castle in which robbers and pirates often
take refuge.

The king next came to a city called Terracina, in which was
formerly a pier covered with copper. He next came to Oarilla,
and then to a castle which bears the name of Capo del Espu-
run. 57 Here is the division of the territories of the Bomans
and of those of the king of Sicily, in that portion thereof which
is called the principality of Capua. After this, the king passed
an island which is called Pantea, and is distant from the city
of Gaeta forty miles. Pantea was the native place of Pilate,
and in it there was formerly a pier covered with copper. The
king next passed an island called Istellemania, which is always
smoking. This island is said to have been set on fire from the
island called Yolcano, the fire from it flying and burning up, as
they say, both sea and fish. Not far distant from this island is
the island of Girun, where there is a good castle and harbour.

The king next passed an island called Baterun, and the
port of Baiae, where are the baths of Yirgil ; it is ten miles
distant from Naples. He then passed Capua and Capo di
Maverba, which lies midway between Naples and Salerno.
On the twenty-eighth day of August the king arrived at
Naples, and proceeded to the abbey of Saint Januarius, to
see the sons of Naimundus, who lie in the crypt 58 there, skin
and bone. Here he made a stay till the Nativity of Saint
Mary the Virgin, the Mother of God, and on the same day,
hiring horses, he proceeded to Salerno, where he stayed a con-
siderable time.

In the meantime, Baldwin, archbishop of Canterbury, Hu-
bert, bishop of Salisbury, and Eanulph de Glanville, who had
come with the king of England as far as Marseilles, there em-
barked on board ship ; and the Lord gave them a prosperous
voyage, so that in a short time, without any accident, he led
them over a vast tract of sea to the siege of Acre. John,
bishop of Norwich, however, went to the pope, and, receiving
from him permission to return, gave up the cross, and returned

home absolved therefrom. After this became known to our
lord the king, he exacted from him, by the hands of the Tem-
plars and Hospitallers, a thousand marks for excusing him.

In the meantime, the fleet of the king of England, which
was commanded by the archbishop of Auxienne, the bishop of
Bayonne, Robert de Sabul, Richard de Camville, and William
de Forts, set out immediately after Easter on its way for Jeru-
salem from the various ports of England, Normandy, Brittany,
and Poitou. One part of this fleet assembled at the port of
Dartmouth, and, after staying there some days, the said ships,
ten in number, set sail for Lisbon, and after passing a certain
headland which projects into the sea, called Godestert, 59 passed
Brittany, having Saint Matthew of Finisterre, or de Fin
Posterne, on the left hand side of the fleet, and the Great
Sea along which is the route to Ireland on the right, and left
Poitou, Gascony, and Biscay on the left hand side of the fleet.
When they had now passed through the British Sea and the
Sea of Poitou, and had come into the Spanish Sea, on the
holy Day of the Ascension of our Lord, at the third hour of
the day, a mighty and dreadful tempest overtook them, and
in the twinkling of an eye they were separated from each
other. "While the storm was raging, and all in their affliction
were calling upon the Lord, the blessed Thomas, the archbishop
of Canterbury and Martyr, appeared at three different times
to three different persons, who were on board a London ship,
in which was William Fitz-Osbert, and Geoffrey, the gold-
smith, saying to them, " Be not afraid, for I, Thomas, the
archbishop of Canterbury, and the blessed Edmund the Mar-
tyr, and the blessed Nicholas, the Confessor, have been ap-
pointed by the Lord guardians of this fleet of the king of
England ; and if the men of this fleet will guard themselves
against sin, and repent of their former offences, the Lord will
grant them a prosperous voyage, and will direct their foot-
steps in His paths." After having thrice repeated these words,
the blessed Thomas vanished from before their eyes, and im-
mediately the tempest ceased, and there was a great calm on
the sea.

And now the London ship, in which the blessed Martyr
Thomas had appeared, had passed by the port of Lisbon
and Cape Saint Vincent, and had neared the city of Silva, 60
which in those days was the most remote of all the cities of

59 Probably " Good start ;" meaning what we now call " Start Point."
w Now called " Silver."

Christendom, and the Christian faith was as yet but in its
infancy there, as it was only the year before that it had been
wrested from the hands of the pagans, and had become Christian,
as already mentioned. The people, therefore, on board the ship,
being ignorant where they were, putting out a boat pulled for
land, and learned, by certain indications, that the land was in-
habited by Christians, and that there was no further [inland]
any safe road for them without a good and sufficient escort. Ac-
cordingly they approached the city ; and on learning the cause
of their arrival, the bishop of the city of Silva, and the clergy
and people, received them with congratulations, giving thanks
to God for their arrival ; for there were in the ship a hundred
young men of prowess and well armed.

In the meantime Botac El Emir Amimoli, emperor of Africa
and of Saracenic Spain, levying a large army, marched into
the territories of Sancho, king of Portugal, to take ven-
geance for the emperor of Africa, his father, who had died six
years before while besieging Santa Erena, a castle of king
Alphonso, father of the said Sancho, king of Portugal. On
this, the citizens of Silva, being alarmed, refused to allow these
young men of London to leave them, but broke up their ship,
and with the timbers of it made bulwarks for the city, pro-
mising and giving them all kinds of security that the king of
Portugal would pay them well for the delay thus occasioned
them, and the injury received in consequence of the loss of
their ship ; which was accordingly done.

The other nine ships of the fleet of the king of England
which had been out in the same storm, made land in different
parts of Spain ; after which, by the guidance of God, sailing
up the river Tagus, they at last arrived at the city of Lisbon.
In this city, of Lisbon rests the body of Saint Vincent the
Martyr. Before they had arrived there, the before-named em-
peror of Africa, on the day of the Nativity of Saint John the
Baptist, forded the river Tagus, and .all his army with him,
and laid siege to a castle of Sancho, king of Portugal, which
is called Torresnovas. On this, the king of Portugal sent
envoys to the strangers who had come in the ships to the. city
of Lisbon, and asked succours of them against the Saracens.

Accordingly, five hundred men, well armed, and selected from
all the ships that had arrived, as being the bravest and most
courageous, preferred to die in war for the name of Jesus
Christ, rather than behold the misfortunes of their race and its

extermination ; and, leaving their ships and companions, pro-
ceeded up the river Tagus to Santa Erena, which is distant from
the city of Lisbon two days' march, where they found Sancho,
king of Portugal, utterly destitute both of resources and coun-
sel ; for he had but few soldiers, and nearly all of those with-
out arms, and the emperor had already taken the castle of the
king which he had besieged, and had laid siege to another
castle, which is called Thomar, and is a castle of the Templars.
On hearing of the arrival of the foreigners, the emperor was
greatly alarmed, and, sending ambassadors to the king of Por-
tugal, demanded of him Silva, on obtaining which, he would
depart with his army, and restore to him the castle which he
had taken, and would keep peace with him for seven years ;
but when the king of Portugal refused to do this, he sent him
word that on the following day he would come to lay siege to
Santa Erena.

On this, the king of Portugal, taking counsel with the
strangers who had come in the ships, placed his men in the
towers, and at the strongest bastions of the walls; while
the foreigners who had come in the ships chose for their
position the weaker parts of the city, employing their own
courage as their walls. On the following day, when all were
prepared for the attack, and there was every moment a mur-
muring at the gates, to the eifect that he would be there that
instant and without delay, a messenger came on a sudden,
and thus said : " The emperor has been dead these three days,
and his army is taking to flight !" and, while he was still
speaking, there came two, and then three, and then still more,
all of whom spoke to the like effect.

Accordingly, the king and all the people believed them, and
the city was filled with gladness and exultation ; jand, on the
next day, the king gave to the men who had come from the ship
leave to return to them, promising that he would handsomely
reward them for their labours. However, before they had
arrived at their ships, Robert de Sabul and Richard de Cam-
ville came to Lisbon with sixty-three great store-ships of
the king of England ; (a store-ship is the same as a trans-
port-ship). 61 Some, however, of the men who had come under
the command of Robert de Sabul and Richard de Camville
were evil-doers and vicious persons ; for, on disembarking from
the ships, they made their way into the city of Lisbon, and as
they went through the streets and lanes, talked to the people
61 " Storiutn" " navigiutn."

of the city giving themselves airs, and then committed violence
upon the wives and daughters of the citizens. They also drove
away the pagans and Jews, servants of the king, who dwelt
in the city, and plundered their property and possessions, and
burned their houses ; and they then stripped their vineyards,
not leaving them so much as a grape or a cluster.

When this became known to the king of Portugal, the lord
of the city of Lisbon, he came with all haste with a powerful
hand ; but on finding there Eobert de Sabul and Eichard de
Camville, with the fleet of the king of England, he manifested
towards them a cheerful countenance and a peaceful disposi-
tion, bearing with patience the injuries done to himself and his
people. On the day after the king's arrival, the commanders
of the fleet exacted an oath from all the men of the fleet that
they would faithfully keep and inviolably observe the before-
mentioned statutes enacted by the king of England.

However, in the course of three days, a quarrel ensued be-
tween the people of Lisbon and some of those who had come
in the ships, in consequence of which, many persons were slain
on both sides in a skirmish that ensued, and the noise of the
people came to the king's ears. On this, the gates of the city
were immediately closed, and all who had gone from the ships
into the city, for the purpose of obtaining provisions and drink,
were taken and thrown into prison, in number seven hundred
men. Before they were released from the custody of the king,
the king of Portugal made peace with Robert de Sabul and
Richard de Camville on such terms as he pleased, that is to say,
to the following effect : that past injuries should be mutually
overlooked, and that they should strictly keep the peace to-
wards the pilgrims throughout all his territories ; and it was
further agreed that the arms and all other things which had
been lost in the affray should be given up on either side.

This having been done, Robert de Sabul and Richard de
Camville left the city of Lisbon with the fleet of the king of
England, on the vigil of Saint James the Apostle, being the
fourth day of the week, and, on the same day, came to the inlet
where the Tagus falls into the sea. On the same day also,
William de Forts de Oleron arrived there with thirty great
ships of the fleet of the king of England ; in consequence
of which, there were together at the same place one hundred
store-ships of the king of England, and six great ships laden
with warriors, provisions, and arms. On the day after the



150 ANNALS OF EOGES DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1190.

feast of Saint James the Apostle, being the sixth day of the
week, Robert de Sabul, Richard de Camville, and William de
Forts de Oleron left the port of Lisbon with the fleet of the
king of England, and passed by a great mountain which pro-
jects into the sea, and is called Espichel, as also the port of
Dalchatht, 62 and Palmella, and Sinnes, formerly a sandy tract
of land extending into the sea ; they then passed the port of
Deordunite, and then a great and lofty mountain which ex-
tends into the sea, and is called Cape Saint Vincent ; on which
the body of Saint Vincent lay many ages entombed, until it was
transferred to the city of Lisbon.

After this, they passed the port of Silva, which at that
time was the most remote city of the Christians in those parts
of Spain. They next passed a city of the pagans, which is
called Santa Maria de Hayrun; and it is worthy of remark why
this city is called Santa Maria de Hayrun. Hayrun is the
name of the place in which the city was founded, while the
Christians who built it gave it the other name, and, in memory
of Mary, the blessed Mother of God, they placed a stone image
of her on the walls. After this, when the pagans prevailed
over the Christians, they gained possession of this place, and,
on finding the image standing upon the walls, they cut oif its
head, feet, and arms, in contempt of the faith of Christ and
of Saint Mary, and threw it at a distance into the sea. On
this being done, the sea and land became unproductive, and
famine prevailed in that land to such a degree, that nearly every
thing, men and animals, died of hunger ; upon which, all the
elders of the people, and the youths, from the highest to the
lowest, weeping day and night, and doing penance in sackcloth
and ashes, recalled to mind the image whose head, hands, and
feet they had cut off, and said : " We have sinned, we have
acted unrighteously, we have done iniquitously> inasmuch as
we have cut off that head, and those hands and feet. For
what evil had they done ? Let us, therefore, seek them, and
let us put them in their places, that thus, at least, God may
turn away His wrath from us, and from this city." Thus saying,
they threw their nets into the sea, where they had thrown the
head, and hands, and feet of the image, and, drawing them upon
land in their nets, they placed the head on the neck, the hands

62 It is hardly necessary to say, that many of the places here mentioned
cannot be recognized, as heing no longer in existence, even if the names
were correctly given in the text, which is far from being the case.

on the arms, and the legs on the thighs, and soldered them with
gold and silver of the finest and purest quality ; after which,
they placed the image in an honored locality, and it is held in
great veneration even to the present day. Immediately upon
this, the famine ceased, and the earth yielded her increase.

After this, they passed the castle which is called Merell, and
then the port of Hodiene ; they next passed the port of Calice, 62
and then a mountain, which is called Montaluc. They then
passed a sandy piece of land projecting into the sea, which is
called Cape Almilan, and then a castle and port, the name of
which is Saltis ; after which, they arrived before the Port of
Seville, the name of which is Windelkebir ; between Seville
and the Port there is a castle midway, which is called Captal.

They now came to the Straits of Africa, and passed through
these Straits on the first day of August, being the feast of
Saint Peter ad Yincula, and the fifth day of the week. Here
the Mediterranean Sea begins, which Sea is so called, because
it is surrounded by land on every side, with the exception of
one inlet and one outlet ; the one of which is called the Straits
of Africa, and the other the Arm of Saint George, 63 at the city
of Constantinople. It is also worthy of remark, that, from
the entrance to the Straits of Africa, as far nearly as Ascalon,
on the right-hand side of the ship [as it sails], lie the territories
of the pagans ; and on the opposite side, from the entrance of the
Straits of Africa as far as the great mountain which is called
Muncian, 64 is Saracenic Spain, which you leave behind to the
left of the ship. It is also worthy of observation, that, accord-
ing to calculations made by mariners, the entry to the Straits
of Africa, from one shore to the other, is not more than six
miles in width, on each side of which there is a large moun-
tain, the one in Spain, called Calpe, the other in Africa, oppo-
site to it, called Atlas. At the entrance of these Straits there
are several cities in Africa near the sea-shore, the names of
which are Bethe, Dudenardi, Esparte, Thange, Cacummin,
Muee, Botoos, and Seep, 55 which is the most noble of all the
cities of Africa. In Spain, on. the opposite side, are several
cities and castles, the names of which are Beche, Dudemarbait,
Leziratarif, Gezehakazera, 66 the island of Jubaltaria, 07 Mertell,

62 Now Cadiz. 6 3 The Bosphorus, or Straits of Constantinople,

were so called from the church of Saint George, which was built on the

shore in the suburbs of Constantinople. 64 Probably Montserrat,

Perhaps Ceuta. <* By this and the preceding name, Algeziras

and Tarifa are probably meant, c ? Gibraltar. ..

and Swail, a castle of the Moors. At the foot of the mountain
of Jubaltaria are two fine cities, one of which is called Alentia,
and the other Jubalar.

Next to these comes the city of Magga ; 67 and after the fleet
of the king of England had passed the above-named cities of
Spain, it next passed the city of Salamame, 68 and then Vilages,
a large city enclosed with a wall, in the circuit of which there
are one hundred and sixty towers of stone. It next passed a
great and lofty mountain, which is called the Cape of Melich,
and then a castle called Munaca. 69 It next passed a noble city
which is called Almeria, where the valuable and fine silk is
manufactured, which is called silk of Almeria ; and then a
great and lofty mountain that extends into the sea, and is called
Cape Alrneria. It then passed Carthagena, a fine city, situate
on the sea-shore ; next after which came Penisecle, a fine and
handsome castle. The fleet then passed a sandy piece of land
projecting into the sea, called Alascerat ; 70 after which came a
piece of land projecting into the sea, which is called Cape Mar-
tin. It next came before a large city which is called Denia,
and then before the port of Valentia. It deserves to be known
that Yalentia is a fine city, distant seven miles from the en-
trance to its harbour. It then passed the castle of Baiane, and
then the castle of Peniscola on the sea-shore, which is the last
castle belonging to the pagans in Spain on this side of the sea.

They then passed a great and lofty mountain projecting into
the sea, which is called Muncian ; this mountain divides the
territories of the pagans from those of the Christians, and here
begins the territory of the king of Arragon. Near this moun-
tain, among the mountains, and at a distance from the sea,
is situate a fine city, the name of which, is Cervera ; and at
the foot of the same mountain, on the sea- shore, stands a castle,
which is called Amposta, in the territory of the kingdom of
Arragon, and occupied by the Hospitallers. Here also is a
great river of fresh water, which has the name of Ebro, and a
noble city called Tortosa ; which stands upon that river, and is
distant from the entrance to the harbour thirty miles.

After this, they passed a populous city on the sea-shore, called
Taragutia, 71 the see of an archbishop, and near it a great
mountain extending into the sea, called Cape Salut, beneath
which mountain lies a good harbour. They next came before a

A.D. 1190. THE FLEET AREIVES AT MARSEILLES. 153

great episcopal city, situate on the sea-shore, the name of which
is Barcelona. They then passed a castle situate on the sea-
shore, called San Felice, where there is a good harbour.
They next passed the territory of count Ponce, opposite a
fine city, the name of which is Ampurias, where there is a good
harbour. They then passed a great mountain projecting into
the sea, which is called Cape Castiglione, where there is a
good harbour, called Port Castiglione, and as you go up the
river, there is a castle called Castiglione. They next passed a
harbour, fine and large, the name of which is Cadakis, and
then a great mountain extending into the sea, which is called
Cape de Creus, at the foot of which there is a good harbour.
They then passed a fine castle situate on the sea- shore, which
is called Cockeliure, 72 where there is a good harbour called
Port Yendres.

They next passed some sand-banks extending into the sea,
called Cape Leucare, which make a conspicuous landmark, on
which, near the sea- shore, is a fine episcopal city, the name of
which is Narbonne, and a monastery, called Saint Mary de Her.
They thenpassed a projection of the land into the sea, which
is called Brescou ; after which they came to the territory of the
count de Agde, passing a fine city situate on the sea-shore,
the name of which is Agde. They then passed near Villeneuve,
the episcopal see of Magalona, near which is the port of Mont-
pellier, the name of which is Lates. They next passed an
island called Odur, which lies at the mouth of the Rhone, going
up which river you come to a fine archiepiscopal city, which
is called Arles-le-Blanc ; and still higher up the same river,
you come near to Saint Gilles, and still higher again, you
come to the fine city which is called Lyons sur Rhone.

They then came to Marseilles, which is twenty miles dis-
tant from the mouth of the Rhone, and is a city subject to the
king of Arragon. Here were the relics of Saint Lazarus, the
brother of Saint Mary Magdalene and of Martha, who held
the bishopric of this place, after Jesus had raised him from
the dead. In this city there is a fine harbour, able to contain
many ships of a large size, almost shut in by high hills,
and on one side of it rises the episcopal city ; opposite to
which, on the other side of the harbour, is the abbey of Saint
Victor, in which a hundred black monks serve God ; and here,
72 Now Collioure.






154 A2TNALS OF EOGEE DE HOVEDEtf. A.D. 1190.

as they say, are the hundred and forty bodies of the Innocents
who were slain for Christ, as also the relics of Saint Victor and
his companions, the rods with which our Lord was scourged,
the jaw-bone of Saint Lazarus, and one of the ribs of Saint
Laurence the Martyr. Between Marseilles and this abbey,
not far from the high road, is a monastery, in which is kept
the arm of Saint Margaret the Virgin ; and near the abbey
of Saint Victor are two lofty hills, one of which is called Mount
Eoland, and the other Mount Hospinel.

It is worthy of remark, that from Marseilles to Acre is
only fifteen days' and nights' sail, 73 with a fair wind ; but in
such case you must go straight through the main sea, so that
after the hills of Marseilles are lost out of sight, land will not be
seen either on the right hand or on the left, if you keep straight
onward in your course, until the land of Syria is seen ; and
if on the right side of the ship any land should chance to be
seen, it is the territory of the pagans, while if land should be
seen on the left side of the ship, it is the territory of the Chris-
tians. It is also as well to be known, that there are many
islands belonging to the Saracens between the Straits of
Africa and Marseilles, one of which is called Majorc, 75 and
another Eniuce, 76 both of which are tributary to the king of
Arragon, the island of Majorc paying him a yearly tribute of
three hundred silken cloths of Almeria, while the island of
Eniuce pays him a yearly tribute of two hundred silken cloths
of like quality.

The Division of tlie Kingdoms on the sea-coast.

In the first place, it ought to be known that the whole land
extending along the sea-shore from England to Spain, namely,
Normandy, Brittany, and Poitou, belongs to the dominions of
the king of England; and this extends as far as the port which
is called Huartz, 77 which divides the territories of the count
of Bayonne from those of the king of Navarre. The territories
of the king of Navarre begin at the port of Huartz, and extend
to the river which is called Castre, and which divides the ter-
ritories of the king of Navarre from those of the king of Castille.
The territories of the king of Castille begin from the river
Castre, and extend as far as the mountains of Sora, which

divide the territories of the king of Castille from those of the
king of Saint Jago. The territories of -the king of Saint Jago
begin from the mountains of Sora and extend to the river
Mina, 78 which divides the territories of the king of Saint Jago
from those of the king of Portugal; while the territories of the
king of Portugal begin at the river Mina, and extend beyond
the city of Silva.

After you come to the city of Silva, the land of the pagans
begins, along the sea-coast of Spain, and subject to the domi-
nion of the emperor of Africa, which extends as far as the great
mountain known by the name of Muncian. In Saracenic
Spain there are four powerful kings : one of whom is called the
king of Cordres, or Corduba, 79 respecting which Lucan says, 80
"Corduba was my birth-place, Nero caused my death; the
wars I sang which the father 80 * and the son-in-law rivals, did
wage." A second is called the king of Gant; 81 while the
third is styled the king of Murcia, and the fourth is the king
of Valentia, whose territories extend as far as the mountain
called Muncian. This mountain divides the land of the Pagans
from the land of the Christians, that is to say, from the ter-
ritories of the king of Arragon; and the territories of the king
of Arragon begin at this mountain called Muncian, and extend
beyond the city of Nice.

At the city of Nice begin the territories of the emperor of
the Romans, in which there is a fine city called Vintimiglia ;
from this the territory of the emperor extends along the sea-
shore as far as Gaeta, in Apulia, the territory of the king of
Sicily. This land is also called the principality of Capua. It
also deserves to be mentioned that midway between Marseilles
and Sicily there are two large islands ; Sardena 82 is the name of
the larger one, while the other is called Corzege. 83 There are
also many islands round Sicily, some of which are burning
islands. 64 In this sea, in the neighbourhood of Sardena and
Corzege, are fish, resembling cuttle-fish, which, coming forth
from the sea, fly in the air, and when they have flown about
the distance of a furlong 85 they descend again to the sea ;
there are also many falcons there flying after these fish, and pur-

suing them, in order to feed upon them. A- person who
has seen this has borne witness to the same, and his testi-
mony is true, 86 for he himself was sitting at table in a ship
high out of the water, when one of these flying fish fell on
the table before him. It is also worthy of remark that one
of the islands in the vicinity of Sicily, which is larger than
the rest, is called Mount Gebel, 87 and used to burn with such
an intense heat that it dried up a great part of the sea in
its vicinity and burned the fish ; but it has now for some time
ceased to burn, through the merits and prayers of Saint Agatha
the Virgin and Martyr. For one day, when the fire was
coming forth from the crater of Mount Gebel more furiously
than usual, and had approached the city of Cattanna, where
rests the holy body of Saint Agatha, a multitude of the pagans,
flying to her sepulchre, carried her veil before them facing the
fire ; on which the flames returned to the sea, and, parching
it, dried it up for nearly a mile, and scorched the fish, many
of which were half burnt, and there are to this day many
fish there of the same kind, which are called the fish of
Saint Agatha. If any of these fish happen to be taken by a
fisherman, they are immediately let go, out of respect to Saint
Agatha, and to the praise and glory of our Lord Jesus Christ,
who is always wonderful and glorious in His saints.

Accordingly, Robert de Sabul, Richard de Camville, and
William de Fortz de Oleron, passing with the fleet of Richard,
king of England, between Africa and Spain, after many tem-
pests which they suffered on the voyage, arrived at Marseilles on
the octave of the Assumption of Saint Mary, being the fourth
day of the week. Not finding their master the king there,
they made a stay of eight days, for some necessary repairs to
the fleet ; after which they set out in pursuit of the king, and
on the feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross, being the
sixth day of the week, arrived at Messina, in Sicily.

On the Lord's day following, Philip, king of France, arrived
there, it being the sixteenth day before the calends of Octo-
ber ; on which, Margarete, the admiral, Jordan de Pin, and
the other governors of the city, received him with all due
honor, and assigned him the palace of Tancred, king of Sicily,
for his abode,. Now when king Richard heard that his fleet
had arrived at Messina, he left Salerno on the thirteenth

day of September ; and, passing an archiepiseopal city called
Amalfi, and another archiepiseopal city called Cosenza, arrived
on the eighteenth day of September at a city and castle called
Escala. Near this castle is a small island, where are said to
have been the schools of Lucan, and there is still a fine cham-
ber beneath the ground, in which Lucan used to study.

The night following the king slept in a village, the name of
which is Lacerart, in the priorate of Monte Cassio. On the
nineteenth day of September the king passed through the
priorate which is called Saint Michael de Josaphat, to another
priory of the same order, which is called Santa Maria de
Fosses, where there is a castle called Saint Luke. On
the twentieth day of September the king, passing by a castle
which is called Lamante, came to a town called Saint Euphe-
mia. On the twenty-first day of September the king came
to Melida, and was there honorably received and entertained
at the abbey of the Holy Trinity. Here there is a tower
of wood close by the abbey, by means of which Eobert Guiscard
attacked and took the castle and town of Melida.

On the twenty-second day of September, the king of Eng-
land, departing from Melida with a single knight, passed through
a certain small town, and, after he had passed through, turned
towards a certain house in which he heard a hawk, and, enter-
ing the house, 87 took hold of it. On his refusing to give it up,
numbers of peasants came running from every quarter, and
made an attack on him with sticks and stones. One of them
then drew his knife against the king, upon which the latter
giving him a blow with the flat of his sword, it snapped asunder,
whereupon he pelted the others with stones, and with difficulty
making his escape out of their hands, came to a priory called
Le Baniare ; but, making no stay there, he crossed the great
river 88 which is called Le Faro de Meschines, and passed the
night in a tent near a stone tower which lies at the entrance
of the Faro, on the Sicilian side. At the entrance of the Faro,
near Labinaria, lies that peril of the sea which is called Scylla,
and at the outlet of the same river is another peril of the sea
which is called Charybdis.

On the twenty-third day of September, Richard, king of
England, arrived at Messina, in Sicily, with many busses and
galleys, in such state and with such a noise of trumpets and
clarions, that alarm seized those who were in the city. The king

of France and his people, and all the chief men of the city of
Messina, together with the clergy and people, stood on the shore,
admiring what they saw and heard respecting the king of
England and his might. On his landing, he immediately
held an interview with Philip, the king of France; after
which conference, the king of France, on the same day, im-
mediately, embarked on board of his ships, intending to pro-
ceed towards the land of Jerusalem; but after he had got
out of harbour, on the same day, the wind shifted, and with
sorrow and reluctance he returned to Messina.

The king of England, however, proceeded to the house of Re-
ginald de Muhec, where a lodging was prepared for him, in the
suburbs of the city, among the vineyards. On the twenty-
fourth and twenty-fifth days of September the king of England
went to the lodging of the king of France, to hold a conference
with him, and the king of France visited the king of England.
In the meantime, Eichard, king of England, sent his envoys
to Tancred, king of Sicily, and delivered from his custody his
sister, Joanna, the former queen of Sicily. On the twenty-
eighth day of September the king of England went to meet his
sister Joanna, who the same day arrived at Messina, from
Palermo, with some gallies sent by king Tancred.

On the twenty-ninth day of September, that is to say, on
the day of Saint Michael, the king of France went to the
lodgings of the sister of the king of England, and saw her and
offered her his congratulations. On the thirtieth day of Septem-
ber the king of England crossed the river del Faro, and took
a place which is extremely well fortified, called Le Baniare,
and on the first day of October brought his sister Joanna to
that place, and, leaving her there with some knights and
a considerable number of men-at-arms, returned to Messina.
On the second day of October the king of England took posses-
sion of a monastery of the Griffons, a very well fortified place,
lying in the middle of the river del Faro, between Messina and
Calabria. Having expelled the monks and their servants, he
placed in it the provisions which had come from England and his
other territories, and garrisoned it with some knights and others.

When the citizens of Messina saw that the king of England
had placed knights and men-at-arms with his sister in the castle
of Le Baniare, and had taken possession of the monastery of the
Griffons, 'they had suspicion of him, believing that he would
seize the whole of the island, if he could: consequently
they were disposed to be easily excited against him. Ac-

cordingly, on the third day of October, a disagreement arose
between the army of the king of England and the citizens
of Messina, and to such a pitch did the exasperation on both
sides increase, that the citizens shut the gates of the city, and,
putting on their arms, mounted the walls. On the king's
troops perceiving this, they made a vigorous attack on the city
gates ; but our lord the king rode to and fro through the army
on a steed of the greatest swiftness, beating back with a staff
such of his men as he could reach, trying to restrain them
from making the attack. However, he was unable so to do ;
and at last returned to his lodging, where, putting on his
armour, he went out again to put an end to the affray
if he possibly could. He then embarked in a boat and re-
paired to the palace of king Tancred, to consult with the
king of France on the affair that had taken place. In the
meantime, however, through the mediation of the elders of the
city, the discord was allayed ; and arms being laid down on
both sides, each party returned home.

On the ninth day of October there came to the king of
England, Eichard, archbishop of Messina, William, archbishop
of Montreal, William, archbishop of Risa, Margarite, the ad-
miral, Jordan de Pin, and many others of the household of
the king of Sicily, who brought with them Philip, king of
France, Reginald, bishop of Chartres, Manasseh, bishop of Lan-
gres, Hugh, duke of Burgundy, Peter, count de Nevers, and
Geoffrey, count de Perche, and, of the household of the king of
England, Walter, archbishop of Rouen, and Gerard, archbishop
of Auxienne, together with many others, in whom they placed
confidence, for the purpose of making peace between them and
the king of England.

Now when the terms of peace had been for some time under
consideration, and they had nearly come to a conclusion thereon,
the citizens of Messina, collecting in great multitudes, pro-
ceeded to the mountains, and waited in readiness, treacher-
ously to fall upon the king of England; while others made
an attack on the lodging of Hugh Le Brun. On this, their
shouts, which were far from subdued, came to the ears of the
king of England, who immediately leaving the conference
with the king of France and the other persons above-named,
ordered all his men to put on their armour, and he, with a
few followers, climbed a steep hill, which no one could have
ipposed he could possibly have done, and having, with



160 ANNALS OF EOGEB DE HOVEDEX. A.D. 1190.

great difficulty, reached the top of the hill, there took to flight
with all possible speed and re-entered the city, the king pur-
suing them with the edge of the sword.

On this, the knights and men-at-arms of the king of Eng-
land bravely attacked the citizens at the gates and walls of
the city, and, suffering many hard blows from stones, at
one moment effected an entrance into the city gates, while at
another they were driven out. Here there were slain five
knights of the king of England's people, and twenty men-at-
arms, while the king of France was looking on, and giving
them no assistance, although they were of one brotherhood with
him in the pilgrimage. As for the king of France, he and his
people entered the city, and made their way through them
in perfect safety.

However, the men of the king of England at last exercised
their strength with such effect, that by main force they burst
open the city gates and mounted the walls in all directions, and so
having entered the city, they took possession thereof, and imme-
diately hoisted the banners of the king of England on the for-
tifications around the walls. At this the king of France
was greatly indignant, and demanded that the banners of the
king of England should be lowered, and his own set up ;
this, however, the king of England would not permit, but
still, that the wishes of the king of France might be satisfied,
he lowered his own banners and gave the city into the charge
of the knights Hospitallers, and the Templars, until every-
thing should have been complied with that he demanded of
Tancred king of Sicily.

Respecting the agreement made between Philip, king of France,
and Richard, king of England, at Messina.

On the eighth day of October, the king of France and the king
of England, before their earls and barons, and the clergy and
people, made oath upon the relics of the Saints, that the one
would defend the other in that pilgrimage, both in going and
returning, with good faith, and the earls and barons swore that
they would strictly and inviolably observe the same. After this,
by the advice and consent of the whole of the army of the pil-
grims, the said kings enacted that all pilgrims who should die
on their journey on the said pilgrimage, might at their pleasure
dispose of all their armour, horses, and apparel which they should



L.D. 1190. ORDINANCES TO BE OBSEBTED ON PILGEIM AGE. 161

make use of, and of a moiety of their possessions which
they might chance to have with them on the journey, at
their own option, provided only they should send nothing back
to their own country ; while clerks might give such orders as
to their chapels and all utensils belonging to such chapels, and
all their books, as they should think fit. The other moiety
was to be at the discretion of Walter, archbishop of Bouen,
Manser, bishop of Langres, the Master of the house of the
knights Templars, the Master of the Hospital, Hugh, duke
of Burgundy, Eaoul de Coucy,- Drogo de Merlou, Eobert de
Sabul, Andrew de Chauvigny, and Gilbert de Wascuil ; who
were to employ the said money towards the relief of the land
of Jerusalem, as they should think necessary. This also the
kings in their own persons swore strictly and faithfully to ob-
serve throughout the whole expedition, on both sides of the
sea, with regard to all the pilgrims of both kingdoms, both
those who should come, as well as those who had come al-
ready. The archbishops and bishops promised on their word
of truth to observe the same. The Masters of the Temple
and the Hospital agreed that the same should be observed on
behalf of their respective orders, while the earls and barons in
their own persons swore that the same should be observed.

Further, no man in all the army was to play at any kind of
game for money, with the exception of knights and the clergy,
who, in one day and night, were not to lose more than twenty
shillings ; and if any knight or clerk should lose more than
twenty shillings in any natural day, as often as such persons
should exceed twenty shillings they were to pay one hundred
shillings to the before-named archbishop, bishop, earls and
barons, who were to add the before-mentioned sums of money
to the said sums. The kings, however, were to play at their
good pleasure ; and in the lodgings of the twp kings their
men-at-arms might play as far as the. sum of twenty shillings,
with the permission of the kings. Also, in presence of arch-
bishops, bishops, earls and barons, with their sanction men-at-
arms might play as far as the sum of twenty shillings. But if
any men-at-arms or mariners, or others of the lower orders,
should be found playing of themselves, men-at-arms were to
be whipped naked three days through the army, unless they
should be prepared to ransom themselves at the arbitration of
the persons before -named ; and the same as to other servants
of a like degree. But if mariners should so play, they were

to be plunged the first thing in the morning into the sea, on
three successive days, after the usage of sailors, once each day,
unless they should be able to ransom themselves at the arbitra-
tion of the persons before mentioned.

Further, if any pilgrim, while on his journey, should borrow
anything of another person, he was to pay back what he had
borrowed ; but as to what he had borrowed before setting out,
he was not to be bound to make repayment during the pil-
grimage.

Further, if any mariner hired for wages, or any men-at-
arms or any other person whatever, clerks and knights ex-
cepted, should leave his master while on the said pilgrimage,
no one else was to receive him, unless the same should be done
by the consent of his master. And if any one, against the
will of his former master, should receive him, he was to be
punished at the discretion of the persons before-mentioned.
And if any person should rashly attempt anything in contra-
vention of the statutes thus solemnly enacted, he was to know
that he thereby rendered himself subject to the excommuni-
cation of the archbishops and bishops of the whole army ; and
all transgressors were to be punished as before mentioned, at
the discretion of the parties before-named, according to the
nature of each case.

Itwas also enacted by the said kings,that themerchant in each
article of merchandize was to be the seller thereof, and that
no one in the army was to be allowed to buy bread to sell the
same again ; nor yet flour, unless some stranger should have
brought the same, and a person should have made bread thereof;
nor yet fine corn, unless in like manner he should have made
bread thereof, or should keep it by him to carry beyond sea.
All dough was entirely forbidden to be purchased ; and all these
things were forbidden to be bought within a town and within
a league from a town.

But if any person should buy fine corn, and make bread of
the same, he was bound to make profit of but one farthing in
the measure, 89 besides the bran.

As to other dealers, in whatever commodity they should deal,
they were bound in every ten pence to make but one penny profit.

No person was to ring any money of our lord the king upon
which the impression should be visible, unless it should be
broken within the rim.

b9 The " salina," or " sayraa," was a measure, the capacities of which
are not known.

No person was to buy any dead flesh to sell the same again,
nor yet any living beast, unless he should kill it within the camp.

No person was to sell his wine at too dear a rate after pro-
clamation 90 once made.

No person was to make bread for sale except at one penny the
loaf, and all dealers were to understand that bread-corn was
alone to be used within a league of the town.

Of the money of England one penny was to be given in all
dealings for four pence of money Anjouin.

It ought also to be known, that all the above enactments
were made and ordained by the advice and consent of the king
of France, the king of England, and the king of Sicily.

On the third day after the capture of the city of Messina,
the chief men of that city and of the whole province gave
hostages to the king of England as pledges that they would
keep the peace towards him and his people, and freely de-
liver into his hand the city of Messina, unless Tancred, king
of Sicily, their master, should publicly make peace with him,
as to all the points on which he demanded satisfaction. Por
he had demanded of king Tancred Mount Saint Angelo, with
the whole earldom and its other appurtenances, on behalf of
his sister Joanna, which William, the former king of Sicily,
her husband, had assigned her for her dower, as also a gilded
chair for the said Joanna, according to the custom of the
queens of that kingdom ; and for his own use a gilded table
twelve feet in length, and a foot and a half in breadth : also,
a large tent of silk, of such size that two hundred knights
might sit at table beneath it, and two gilded tressels to sup-
port the said gilded table, besides four - and - twenty cups,
and as many dishes, of silver, and sixty thousand measures 91
of corn, as many of barley, and as many of wine, and a hun-
dred armed galleys, with all their equipments, and victuals
for the galley- men for two years. All these things the king
of England demanded for his own use, as being the heir of
king Henry, for whom the above-named king of Sicily had
provided all the things above mentioned, and had bequeathed
the same to him on his last illness.

Tancred, king of Sicily, made answer to him to the follow-
ing effect : "I gave to your sister Joanna ten hundred thou-
sand pieces of money, arising from lands, in satisfaction of

her dower, before she left me, and as to the rest of your
demands, I will do whatever I shall feel myself bound to do,
in conformity with the customs of this kingdom." Accord-
ingly, by the advice of prudent councillors, the king of Sicily
gave to the king of England twenty thousand ounces of gold,
in satisfaction of the dower of his sister, and another twenty
thousand ounces of gold, by way of compromise for all the
other particulars before mentioned, which he had demanded
of right as the bequest of William, king of Sicily, deceased,
and agreed that a marriage should be had between Arthur,
duke of Brittany, his nephew, and a daughter of king Tan-
cred. These concessions being made on either side, Richard,
king of England, wrote to Tancred, king of Sicily, to the
following effect :

The treaty of peace made 'between Richard, king of England, and
Tancred, king of Sicily.

" To Tancred, by the grace of God the illustrious king of
Sicily, and of the dukedom of Apulia and the principality of
Capua, Richard, by the same grace, king of England, duke of
Normandy and Aquitaine, and earl of Anjou, health in Him
who bestows health upon kings. Whereas, while on our
pilgrimage, the Lord inspiring us thereto, we were passing
through your lands for the purpose of aiding the land of Je-
rusalem, which, its sins so demanding, the incursions of the
pagans have in a great measure overrun, and the sword of the
enemies of Christ laid waste, we were compelled to make some
stay at your city of Messina, the inclemency of the winds, and
of the sea, and of the season, preventing us from setting sail,
on which, a dissension chancing to arise between our people
and the citizens of the said city, great loss resulted to both
parties both in property and men : in consequence whereof,
it seemed probable to many that our brotherly love and affec-
tion might receive some check : we have therefore taken due
care to observe the purpose and intention of our pilgrim-
age, and have resolved that both by ourselves, and by our
dearly-beloved and faithful friends, as also by your venerable
archbishops, to wit, Richard, archbishop of Messina, William,
archbishop of Montreal, William, archbishop of Risa, and
Richard, son of the venerable man Walter, your chancel-
lor, and other excellent men delegated on your behalf, the
bonds of inviolate peace should be drawn still closer between

us ; the tenor of which should be preserved to last to future
ages by being reduced to writing. Therefore, we have pro-
mised to you, and to your realm, and to all lands under your
dominion, that we will, both by land, and sea, both of our-
selves and of our people, observe a lasting peace, all questions
whatsoever being set at rest, which, by our envoys to you, we
had raised, both as to the dower of the queen, our sister, as
also other matters ; this, also, being added thereto, that, so
long as we shall stay in your kingdom, we will be everywhere
in readiness for the defence of your territories, and give you
our assistance, whoever may wish to invade the same, or wage
war against you. To the tenor and form of this treaty of
peace, which it is our wish and our purpose, with unbroken,
faith, to observe towards you and your people, we have, by
Walter, archbishop of Rouen, Gerard, archbishop of Auxienne,
John, bishop of Evreux, Bernard, bishop of Bayonne, Jordan de
Humez, our constable, William de Courcy, Richard de Camville,
Gerard Talbot, Robert de Sabul, Guido de Croum, Guarine Fitz-
gerald, Bertram de Verdun, William Chamberlain de Tanker -
ville, Robert de Newburgh, Hugh Bardolph, Wigain de Cher-
bourg, Gilbert de Wascuill, Hugh le Bruin, John de Filler,
Amauri de Montfort, Andrew de Chauvigny, William de Ports
de Oleron, Geoffrey de Rancune, Ainauri Torel, and many others
of our household, made oath, upon our soul, in presence of the
before-named archbishops appointed by you for the said purpose,
and others of your illustrious men,to confirm and ratify the same,
according to the tenor of the articles therein contained. And
farther, to the end that this peace and brotherly love may be
knit together by bonds as multiplied as stringent, the before-
named principal men of your court treating thereon on your
behalf, and the Lord so disposing, we have agreed that a mar-
riage shall be contracted, in the name of Christ, between
Arthur, the excellent duke of Brittany, our nephew, and, if
we shall chance to die without issue, our heir, and your
daughter ; so that when she shall, by the will of God, have ar-
rived at marriageable years, and you shall have sent her to such
place as shall have been agreed upon by either side, our said
nephew shall, within fifteen days from the time of his meeting
her, be espoused to her as his lawful wife ; or if it shall please
your highness that she shall be married before she arrives at
marriageable years, our said nephew shall so do according to
your pleasure therein, if the Supreme Pontiff shall grant a



166 AETNALS OF ROGER DE HOVEDEtf. A. J). 1190.

dispensation for the same. And as it is our wish that such a
dower shall be assigned to her as shall bent an illustrious lady
and the daughter of a mighty king, we do engage, on behalf
of our said nephew, that such a dower shall be provided for her
out of the dukedom of our said nephew, and the same we have
caused to be sworn at the present time by our faithful servants
before named, and do engage that the same shall be given by
our said nephew ; and we admit that we have received for the
use of our nephew, from your mightiness, a sum for the said mar-
riage, that is to say, twenty thousand ounces of gold ; this also
being a part of the agreement, that if, which may heaven pre-
vent, either shall die in the meantime, or if, through the fault
of our nephew, or of ourselves, or of his people, the said mar-
riage shall not take place, then, in such case, we or our heirs
will, without any demur thereto, repay to you or to your heirs
the above-mentioned sum of money in full. Moreover, as to the
said matters, that is to say, the treaty of peace which we have
ratified and confirmed with you, and as to repayment of the
said sums of money, in case from the before-named causes
intervening the said marriage shall not take place, we do give
our lord the pope and the Church of Rome as our sureties ; to
the end that if, which may God forbid, the said peace should
chance to be violated on our part, the Church of Borne shall
have power, by stringent measures, to coerce both ourselves
and our territories. In like manner, also, he shall have full
power to compel ourselves and our nephew to contract the said
marriage, or in case, by reason of the causes before-mentioned,
the said marriage should not take place, to compel us, or our
heirs, or territories, to repay the said sum of money. That
this, also, we will do, the Roman church being our surety, we
have bound ourselves by the oaths of the persons above named,
according to the tenor of the words contained in the instru-
ment which we have sent to you, sealed with our seal. More-
over, if, in case of our dying without heirs [our issue], he shall
succeed to our throne by hereditary right, then we do assign to
her from our kingdom the following dower, that is to say, the
ancient and customary dower of the queens of England."

The form of the treaty made upon oath between Richard, king
of England, and Tancred, king of Sicily.

"I, M"., do swear upon these Holy Gospels of God, that my
lord Richard, king of England, shall from this hour forward






A.D. 1190. LETTEE OF KING EICHAED TO POPE CLEMENT. 167

preserve with the lord Tancred, king of Sicily the dukedom
of Apulia and the principality of Capua, and his realm, and
all the lands under his dominion, lasting peace, hoth himself and
his, by land and by sea ; and that, so long as my said lord shall
be in the kingdom of king Tancred, he shall give him his assist-
ance in defending his territories wheresover he shall happen to
be in the territories of the lord Tancred, king of Sicily, and what
person soever may attempt to invade, or make war, against
the same ; and that my lord shall, with his own hand, swear
to observe this same treaty of peace, if the lord, king Tan-
cred, shall, in like manner, with his hand, swear to observe the
said treaty of peace. And if, at any time, which may heaven
prevent, my lord shall attempt to break the said peace, I will
place myself in the custody of the said lord, the king Tancred,
wheresoever he shall think fit ; and all these things my lord
Eichard, king of England, and I myself, will observe in good
faith, and without fraud and evil intent ; so help us God, and
these Holy Gospels of God, and the relics of the Saints. Amen."
It is also worthy to be remarked, that the archbishops,
bishops, and other subjects of king Tancred swore to the same
effect, upon his soul, that he and his people would keep the peace
towards Richard, king of England, and his people, by sea and
by land, so long as they should be in his territories ; and if the
said Tancred, king of Sicily, and his people, should not keep
the peace, then the said archbishops, and others, who had
taken that oath on behalf of king Tancred, would place them-
selves in the custody of the king of England wheresoever he
should think fit. It is also to be observed, that king Tancred
gave to Eichard, king of England, another twenty thousand
ounces of gold in satisfaction of all questions which he had
raised, both as to the dower of his sister, the queen, as also
concerning all his other demands ; and, to the end that king
Tancred might be made more secure as to all the covenants
above mentioned, Eichard, king of England, wrote to the Su-
preme Pontiff to the following effect :

The Letter of Richard, king of England, to pope Clement, relative
to the peace made between him and king Tancred.

" To his most reverend lord and most holy father Clement,
by the grace of God, Supreme Pontiff of the Holy Apostolic
See, Eichard, by the same grace, king of England, duke
of Normandy and Aquitaine, and earl of Anjou, health and

sincere dutifulness in the Lord. The actions of princes are
blessed with more prosperous results when they receive strength
and favour from the Apostolic See, and are directed by com-
munication with the Church of Rome. Wherefore, we have
deemed it proper to transmit to the knowledge of your Holi-
ness the matters which have been lately arranged between our-
selves and the lord Tancred, the illustrious king of Sicily, by
public treaty, which indeed was suggested by necessity. We
have then established with him brotherly love and lasting con-
cord, and the same, by the oaths of our nobles, archbishops,
bishops, and very many illustrious men, we have promised that
we will with inviolate fidelity observe towards him and his peo-
ple, and all the territories of his dominions. And for the further
purpose of binding this treaty of peace and friendship with a
still more stringent tie, we have thought proper to make a con-
tract of marriage between Arthur, the excellent duke of Brit-
tany, our most dearly-beloved nephew, and heir, if we shall
chance to die without issue, and, with the will of God, his illus-
trious daughter ; and, by the bounty of the Lord, the same shall
be brought to a due consummation when the illustrious damsel
shall have arrived at marriagable years, or when it shall have
pleased the said lord, the king Tancred, for her, before she has
arrived at marriageable years, to be given in marriage to our
nephew, if the Holy Church of Rome shall, in like manner,
think fit to grant a dispensation for the same. And, further,
the sum of money which for the said marriage we have re-
ceived for the use of our nephew from the said lord, the king
Tancred, namely, twenty thousand ounces of gold, in case,
which heaven forbid, by reason of the death of either, or
through the fault of ourselves, or of our nephew, or of his
people, the said marriage shall not take place, we, or our heirs,
are bound on our part by oaths made to that effect to repay in
full to the lord the king Tancred, or his heirs. To the end,
therefore, that the terms of the said treaty of peace so con-
cluded, and full acquiescence in the marriage thus contem-
plated, may, with all due integrity, be secured on the part of
ourselves and our nephew, in such manner as we have upon
oath promised to the lord the king Tancred, we do earnestly
entreat your Holiness, and the Holy Church of Rome, that the
Holy See will undertake to be surety on our behalf towards
the lord the king Tancred and his heirs, for our constant ob-
servance of the peace thus established between us, and for the






A.D. 1190. SCYLLA AND CHAEYBEIS. 169

due fulfilment of the said contract of marriage ; or, in case,
from the reasons before mentioned, the said marriage should
not take place, for the repayment of the said sum of money.
And that, with due confidence the Church of Rome may un-
dertake conjointly with you to share the burden of the said
surety, we do upon the testimony of these present letters grant
to yourselves, and to the Holy Church of Rome, free power
with all stringency to coerce ourselves and our heirs and ter-
ritory, if either we shall contravene the terms of the said treaty
of peace, or if, the marriage, from the causes before mentioned,
not taking place, we, or our heirs, shall refuse repayment of
the said sum of money. Your Holiness well knows how to show
due regard to the honor of us both ; and that, if through the
mediation of the Church of Rome, the advantages of peace
and of the intended marriage shall be duly served, numerous
benefits will at a future day ensue therefrom. Witness our-
selves, on this eleventh day of November, at Messina."

However, before this treaty of peace was fully concluded
and ratified between the king of England and the king of
Sicily, Margarite, the admiral, and Jordan de Pini, members
of the household of the king of Sicily, to whom he had given
charge of the city of Messina, left it by night, taking with
them their families and the substance which they possessed in
gold and silver. The king of England, however, on their de-
parture, seized their houses, and galleys, and other possessions,
into his own hands.

After this, the king of England caused a wide and deep
trench to be cut through the middle of the island on which is
the monastery of the Griffons, in the middle of the river del
Faro, where his treasures and provisions were stored : which
trench ran right across the width of the whole island, from
one shore to the other, and terminated in Charybdis.

It is worthy of remark, that in this river, called the Faro di
Messina, are those two most noted perils of the sea, Scylla
and Charybdis, the one of which, namely, Scylla, is at the
entrance of the Faro, near the priory of Le Baniare, and the
other, namely, Charybdis, is near the outlet of the Faro ; for
the purpose of knowing which, a tower of stone was erected in
the above-named island near the trench made by the king of
England. It is also to be observed, that Scylla is always vomit-
ing forth and casting its waves on high, and consequently it is
necessary that those who pass should keep themselves at a



170 ANNALS OF BOGEE DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1 1 DO.

considerable distance, for fear lest they should be overwhelmed
by the fury of the tide. On the other hand, Charybdis is
unceasingly drawing towards it and sucking in the waves ;
wherefore, those who pass by, ought to take care that they are
not sucked in by it. Still, some incautious persons, while
trying to avoid Scylla, fall into Charybdis.

The king of England, while the final completion of the
treaty of peace between him and king Tancred was being
delayed, built a strong castle for himself on the brow of a lofty
hill outside of the walls of the city of Messina, which they
called Mate Griffon. The Griffons, before the arrival of the
king of England, were more powerful than any of the inhabit-
ants of those parts, and held in extreme hatred all the people
who lived beyond the mountains, so much so, that they thought
but very little of killing them, and there was no one to help
them. But from the time that the king of England came
there, their mischievous exploits were brought to a termina-
tion, and, their power being crushed, they became more con-
temptible than any other of the inhabitants of that land;
for, hoping that they could do to the king of England as
they had been able to do to others in days of yore, they fell
into the pit which they themselves had dug, and became out-
casts in the land.

On the other hand, the English nation was held in the
highest esteem in the kingdom of Sicily. Thus was fulfilled
the prophecy which was found inscribed in ancient characters
on tables of stone near a vill of the king of England, the name
of which is Here ; which Henry, king of England, gave to
William Eitz- Stephen, and where the said William built a
new house, on a pinnacle of which was placed the figure of a
stag ; which is supposed to have been done in order that the
prophecy might be fulfilled, which said

Ireland, and the feats of king Richard in Apulia and Sicily. The release
of the right to wreck is perhaps alluded to in the last.

the salvation of his soul, abandoned all claims whatsoever on his
part for ever to wreck throughout the whole of his territories,
and enacted that every shipwrecked person who should reach
shore alive should freely and quietly have all his property.
And if a person should die on board ship, then his sons or
daughters, or brothers or sisters, were to have his property,
according to the degree in which they should be able to prove
themselves his nearest heirs. But if the person so dying
should have neither sons nor daughters, nor brothers nor sis-
ters, then the king was to have his chattels. This release of
right to wreck, Richard, king of England, made and confirmed
by his charter in the second year of his reign, at Messina, in
the month of October, in the presence of Walter, archbishop
of Rouen, Gerard, archbishop of Auxienne, John, bishop of
Evreux, Bernard, bishop of Bayonne, and many others of the
clergy and laity of the household of the king of England, and
the charter was delivered by the hand of Master Roger Mal-
chien, the king's vice-chancellor.

In the same year, more than a hundred thousand pagans who
were in the kingdom of Sicily, and servants of king William,
after his death indignantly refused to serve under king Tan-
cred, both because Henry, king of the Germans, had laid claim
to the throne of Sicily, as also because Richard, king of Eng-
land, entering the kingdom of Sicily, had taken possession of
a great part thereof. They consequently retired to the moun-
tainous parts with their wives, sons, daughters, and cattle,
and there lived, attacking the Christians, and doing them con-
siderable injury.

However, when they heard that a treaty of peace and a
final reconciliation had been made between the king of England
and king Tancred, they returned into the service of king Tan-
cred, and after giving him hostages as sureties that they would
keep the peace, came back to their homes, and cultivated the
land as they had cultivated it in the time of king William,
and so became the servants of king Tancred.

In the same year, after his father, Frederic, emperor of the
Romans, had lost his life by drowning, Conrad, duke of Suabia,
was made king of the Germans and Alemannians, and the
other nations subject to his father, and repaired to the siege
of Acre with a great army ; immediately on which a great
famine arose among those besieging Acre, and increased to
such a degree, that a loaf of bread which used to be sold before



172 ANNALS OF ROGER DE HOTEDEN. A.D. 1190.

their arrival for one penny, was soon after sold at the price of
sixty 93 shillings. Upon this, great numbers of the army died
of famine, as one horse-load of corn was being sold for sixty-
four marks, English money ; and in consequence, the principal
men present at the siege were obliged to feed on horse-flesh,
eating it as a delicacy.

Now when the famine had increased to an extraordinary
degree of severity, the clamour of the people reached Hubert
Fitz- Walter, bishop of Rouen, 94 and the other bishops in the ex-
pedition, on which they made a collection of money to relieve
the necessities of the poor, and the Lord gave such increase to
the sums so collected, that they sufficed for the sustenance of
all who were in want, until such time as God, the giver of all
good things, looking from on high, sent them an abundance of
corn, wine, and oil ; for the third day after the collection was
distributed among the poor, there came to Acre ships laden
with corn, wine, and oil, and made so plentiful a market,
and on such moderate terms, that a measure of wheat which
before was sold for two hundred besants, was shortly after to
be had for six.

In the same year, on the day of Saint James the Apostle,
ten thousand youths of prowess and well armed, came forth
from among the troops besieging the city of Acre, in spite of
the prohibition of the king, the Patriarch, and the leader of
the army, with the intention of engaging with Saladin and
his army; but Saladin, on seeing them, retreated with his
army, leaving behind his tents and provisions. On this, the
young men entered the tents of the pagans, and ate and drank
of what they found therein ; after which they carried away
with them whatever they could find of value, and loaded
themselves therewith ; but, when they were returning towards
the force besieging Acre, Saladin and his army fell upon them
and put them to the edge of the sword, and they were nearly
all slain by the pagans ; a few of them, however, leaving their
loads behind, escaped by the aid of Ralph de Hautereve, arch-
deacon of Colchester.

In the same year, Sibylla, queen of Jerusalem, wife of
Guido of Lusignan, and his two daughters, departed this
life at the siege of Acre ; upon whose death, Conrad, Marquis of
Montferrat, lord of Tyre, seeing that there was no nearer heir
to the throne of Jerusalem than Milicent, the wife of Amfrid

93 Another reading says " forty."
9A Clearly a mistake for " Salisbury."






A. D. 1190. THE EING OF ENGLAND'S FLEET EEPAiRED. 173

de Tours, sister of the said Sibylla, held a conference with the
Patriarch Heraclius before mentioned, and the mother of the
lady before named, and all the chief men of the army of the
Christians, and demanded that the sister of the deceased queen
should be given him to wife, promising that for the future he
would faithfully and zealously promote the interests of the
army of the Christians, and would from that time forward
hold no communication whatever with Saladin. On this, the
mother of the lady, the Patriarch, and a considerable number
of the chief men of the army, yielded assent to his requests,
and, effecting a divorce between the said lady and Amfrid de
Tours, her husband, gave her in marriage to Conrad ; who
immediately laid claim to the kingdom of Jerusalem against
Guido, in right of his wife ; upon which Guido offered to abide
by the lawful decision of the court of the kings of France and
England, who were shortly about to arrive ; but Conrad, being
unwilling to wait so long a time, usurped all power in the
kingdom, and banished king Guido.

In the same year, while Philip, king of the Franks, and
Richard, king of the English, were staying at Messina, in
Sicily, in the month of December, on the fourteenth day before
the calends of January, being the fourth day of the week,
loud thunder was heard at Messina, and many and terrible
flashes of lightning were seen ; a thunderbolt also fell in one
of the galleys of the king of England and sank it, striking
the walls of the city of Messina, of which it levelled a
great part. The knights also and men-at-arms of the king of
England, who were keeping guard in the monastery of the Grif-
fons, in which were the treasures of the king of England,
asserted as a truth that they saw a ball of fire on a pinnacle of
that monastery, not burning but sending forth a light, which re-
mained there as long as the tempest raged, and after that ceased
the ball of fire disappeared. On their expressing surprise at
this, and making careful enquiries what it could possibly mean,
the Griffons there serving God made answer with one accord,
that this always happened whenever a storm arose.

The king of England in the meantime, while he was staying
at Messina, caused all the ships of his fleet to be hauled ashore
and repaired, as many of them had become damaged in con-
sequence of being eaten away by worms. For in the river
Del Faro there are certain thin worms, which in the language
of the people are called "Beom," whose food is every kind



174 ANNALS OF KOGER DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1190.

of -wood. "Whenever these have once adhered to any kind
of wood, they never leave go thereof, except through main
force, until they have pierced right through ; they make narrow
straight holes when they have effected an entrance, and then
from gnawing away the wood they become so increased in size
and bulk, that in coming forth they make wider holes. In the
mean time, Richard, king of England, caused stone engines and
other engines of war to be prepared, for the purpose of taking
the same to the land of Jerusalem.

In the same year, William, bishop of Ely, legate of the
Apostolic See, chancellor of our lord the king and justiciary
of all England, oppressed the people entrusted to his charge
with heavy exactions. For in the first place he despised all
his fellows whom the king had associated with him in the
government of his kingdom, and disregarded their advice. In-
deed, he considered no one of his associates in the kingdom his
equal, not even John, earl of Mortaigne, the king's brother. Ac-
cordingly, he laid claim to the castles, estates, abbeys, churches,
and all the rights of the king as his own. On the authority
also of his legateship, he came to take up his lodging at
bishoprics, abbeys, and priories, and other houses of the reli-
gious orders, with such a vast array of men, horses, hounds,
and hawks, that a house where he took up his abode for only a
single night, was hardly able within the three following years
to recover its former state. From the clerks and laity he also
took away their churches, farms, lands, and other possessions,
which he either divided among his nephews, clerks, and ser-
vants, or else, to the loss of the owners, retained possession of
them himself, or squandered them away to supply his extraor-
dinary expenses.

Did not this wretched man consider that he should one day
have to die ? Did he not think that the Lord would demand of
each an account of his stewardship, or honorable conduct in his
government ? But well is it said as to such men as this :
" Nothing is more unendurable than a man of low station when
he is exalted on high. On every side he strikes, while on every
side he fears ; against all does he rage, that they may have an
idea of his power ; nor is there any beast more foul than the
rage of a slave let loose against the backs of the free." 94

9i " Asperius hum ill nihil est cum surgit in altum,

Cuncta ferit, dum cuncta timet, desaevit in omnes,
Ut seposse putent ; nee bellua tetrior ulla,
Quain servi rabies iu libera terga furentis."



A. D. 1190. RESTORATION MADE TO THE DUKE OF SAXOKY. 175

In the same year, on the third day after the feast of Saint
Michael, about four thousand armed Saracens came forth from
the city of Acre, and burned four of the stockades with Greek
fire ; but they were manfully repulsed by the soldiers of the
army, and lost twenty Turks who were slain, and many
wounded. After this, at the feast of Saint Martin, the Sara-
cens again sallied forth from the city of Acre, and made an
attack upon the Christians, who manfully withstood them.
Baldwin de Carun, Walter de Oyri, and Baldwin de Dargus,
valiantly withstood their attack, until count Henry and Geof-
frey de Lusignan had come up with the Templars, and com-
pelled the pagans to give way with such a mighty charge,
that they lost in their flight forty Turks who were slain, and
many wounded.

After this, between the feast of Saint Andrew and the Na-
tivity of our Lord, the wholo army of the Christians was in
arms, for the purpose of making an assault upon the city of
Acre, and the Germans and English drew their scaling-ladders
to the trenches, that they might place them against the walls ;
on which the pagans went out of the city by the postern gates,
and took their scaling-ladders from the Germans, and drove
the English away from the trenches, and then fastened ropes
to the scaling-ladder of the English, with the intention of
drawing it into the city ; but Ralph de Tilly, Humphrey de
Yeilly, Robert de Lanlande, and Roger de Glanville, mounted
the scaling-ladder of the English, and four times extinguished
the Greek fire that was thrown down ; and Ralph de Tilly
coming nearer than the others, cut asunder the ropes with his
sword, and so rescued the scaling-ladder from the hands of
the pagans. Shortly after, between the feast of Saint Andrew
and the Nativity of our Lord, the famine already mentioned
began in the army of the Christians, and continued until the
Purification of Saint Mary.

In the same year, Henry, king of the Germans, on hearing
of the death of Frederic, emperor of the Romans, his father,
restored to Henry, duke of Saxony, all that his father had
taken from him, and, by way of addition thereto, gave him
ten most excellent castles. He also did the like to all others
from whom his father had taken anything away, restoring to
each person what was his own. All his subjects therefore
being now reconciled to him, he sent his envoys to pope Cle-
ment, and the cardinals and senators of the city, demanding



176 ANNALS OP EOGEE DE HOVEDEN. A. D. 1190.

the Roman empire, and promising that he would in all things
maintain the laws and dignities of the Eomans nnhurt. On this,
pope Clement, having with due deliberation held council with
the cardinals and senators and Roman people, respecting the
demand of the king of the Germans, granted the king what
he asked for, saving always the dignities and customs of the
Romans, and appointed for him as the time for coming to
Rome the following Easter ; but before he arrived there, pope
Clement died.

In the same year, David, brother of William, king of Scot-
land, took to wife Matilda, sister of Ranulph, earl of Chester.
In this year also, a dispute again happened between Geoffrey,
archbishop elect of York, and Bucard, the treasurer of the
same church, in consequence of which the archbishop elect
excommunicated the before mentioned Bucard, who went to
pope Clement, and was deemed worthy by him to be absolved
therefrom; while with the Supreme Pontiff he threw such
difficulties in the way of the business of the archbishop elect
of York, that the Supreme Pontiff would neither confirm his
election nor allow him to be consecrated. In addition to this,
the Supreme Pontiff conferred on Hugh, bishop of Durham,
the privilege of not making any profession or submission
throughout his life to Hugh, the archbishop elect of York,
not even though he should be consecrated to the archbishopric ;
on the ground that the said bishop of Durham had once
already made profession to the church of York, and to Saint
William, at that time archbishop of York, and his Catholic
successors.

In the same year, Richard, king of England, the Divine
grace inspiring him thereto, being sensible of the filthiness of
his life, after due contrition of heart, having called together
all the archbishops and bishops who were with him at Messina,
in the chapel of Reginald de Moyac, fell naked at their feet,
and did not hesitate to confess to God, in their presence, the
filthiness of his life. For the thorns of lustfulness had de-
parted from his head, and it was not the hand of man who
rooted them out, but God, the Father of Mercies, who wisheth
not for the death of a sinner, but rather that he may turn from his
wickedness and live, looked upon him with the eyes of mercy and
gave him a heart to repent, and called him to repentance, for he
received the penance imposed by the bishops before named, and
from that hour forward became a man who feared God, and left

what was evil and did what was good. happy the man whc
so falls as to rise with greater strength still ! happy th(
man who after repentance does not relapse into faultiness an$
a course of ruin !

In the same year, Eichard, king of England, hearing, by
common report and the relation of many persons, that there was
a certain religious man in Calabria, of the Cistercian order,
called Joachim, abbat of Curazzo, who had a spirit of prophecy
and foretold to the people things to come, sent for him and
willingly listened to the words of his prophecy, and his wisdom
and learning. For he was a man learned in the Holy Scrip-
tures, and interpreted the visions of Saint John the Evan-
gelist, which Saint John has related in the Book of Revelation,
which he wrote with his own hands ; in hearing which, the
king of England and his people took great delight.

The following was one of the visions of Saint John the
Evangelist : " The kings are seven in number ; five are fallen,
and one is, and the other is not yet come." 9i> And elsewhere in
the Revelation there is another vision of the same Evangelist.
" A woman clothed with the sun, 96 and the moon beneath her
feet ;" which signifies the Holy Church, the sun of justice.
Also, " the woman was clothed with the sun, and the moon was
under her feet, and upon her head was a crown of twelve stars,
and, being with child, she was in pain to be delivered ; and,
behold ! a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns,
and seven crowns upon his head : and his tail drew the third
part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth ;
and he stood before the woman who was about to be delivered,
to devour her child as soon as it was born. And the woman
brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a
rod of iron, and her child was caught up unto the Lord, and to
His throne. And the woman fled into the wilderness of Egypt,
where she had a place prepared of God, that they should feed
her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days." 97

Now of this vision the following is the interpretation, ac-
cording to Joachim, abbat of Curazzo. " The woman clothed
with the sun, and the moon under her feet," signifies the Holy
Church, the sun of justice, who is Christ our God, shadowed
forth and typified under that name; under his feet is the
world, always to be trodden under foot with its vices and

Fts. And " upon her head was a crown of twelve stars." Now

the head of the Church is Christ, His crown is the Catholic
faith which the twelve Apostles have preached. " The woman
was in pain to be delivered." So the Holy Church, which
ever rejoices in new offspring, suffers pain from day to day, to
the end that she may gain souls for God, which the devil
attempts to snatch away and to drag with himself down to
hell. " And behold ! a great red dragon, having seven heads
and ten horns." Now this dragon signifies the devil, who is
properly said to have seven heads. For all the heads of the
devil are replete with iniquity, and he uses the figure 7 as
something finite for what is infinite ; for the heads of the devil
are infinite in number ; that is to say, those who are perse-
cutors of the Church, and the wicked. Of these, although
they are infinite in number, the said Joachim, in his explana-
tion, made mention of seven principal persons who were per-
secutors of the Church, whose names were as follow : Herod,
Nero, Constantius, Mahomet, Melsermut, Saladin, and Anti-
christ.

" Saint John also says in the Book of Revelation, ' There are
seven kings ; five are fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet
come : ' which the said Joachim thus explained. The seven
kings are Herod, Nero, Constantius, Mahomet, Melsermut,
Saladin, and Antichrist. Of these, five have perished ; namely,
Herod, Nero, Constantius, Mahomet, and Melsermut ; one is,
namely, Saladin, who is now oppressing the Church of God ;
and, together with it, the Sepulchre of our Lord, and the Holy
City of Jerusalem and the land on which stood the feet of our
Lord are kept in his possession ; but he shall shortly lose the
same. On this, the king of England asked the question, ""When
shall this take place?" To which Joachim made answer,
" When seven years shall have elapsed from the day of the
capture of Jerusalem." Upon which, the king of England
remarked, ""Why, then, have we come so much too soon?"
^/When Joachim made answer, " Your arrival is very neces-
I sary, inasmuch as the Lord will give you the victory over His
enemies, and will exalt your name beyond all the princes of
[the earth."

"The words then follow, "One of them is not yet come,"
which is Antichrist. Now as to this Antichrist, Joachim said,
" He is already born in the city of Borne, and will be elevated
to the Apostolic See ; and it is respecting this Antichrist that
the Apostle says, ' He is exalted, and strives against every



A. D. 1190. INTERPRETATION OF SAINT JOHN'S VISION. 179

thing that is called of God.' And then shall the wicked one
be revealed whom the Lord Jesus shall slay with the breath
of His mouth, and shall destroy by the dazzling brightness of
his approach." On this, the king turned to him and said, " I
thought that Antichrist was to be born in Antioch, or at
Babylon, of the descendants of Dan, and was to reign in the
Temple of the Lord at Jerusalem, and was to walk in that
land in which Christ walked, and was to reign therein three
years and a half, and was to dispute against Elias and Enoch,
and was to slay them, and was afterwards to die, and after his
death the Lorof was to give sixty days for repentance, during
which those persons might repent who had wandered away
from the paths of truthfulness, and had been seduced by the
preaching of Antichrist and his false prophets."

" It then proceeds, " And there are ten horns." Now the
ten horns of the devil are heresies and schisms, which heretics
and schismatics oppose to the ten precepts of the law and
the commandments of God. " And upon his head were seven
crowns." By the crowns are signified the kings and princes
of this world, who are to believe in Antichrist. "And his
tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven." This refers
to the great number of persons who shall believe in him.
"And did cast them to the earth." By the name of stars he
calls the lower orders of men who are to believe in Antichrist ;
and he mentions the third part of the stars of heaven by reason
of the great multitude of men who shall believe on him.
11 And he did cast them to the earth;" that is to say, he sent
all those to the bottomless pit who had perished in believing
on him. " And he stood before the woman, who was about to
be delivered, to devour her child as soon as it was born." The
devil ever lies in wait for the Church, that he may carry off
her offspring, and, after so carrying it off, devour it. He is
well said " to stand ; " inasmuch as he never turns aside for
evil, but always stands steadfast in wickedness and inflexible
in the crafty wiles of his deceit. Or, according to another
interpretation, his tail will signify the end of this world ; at
which time certain wicked nations shall arise, which shall be
called Gog and Magog, and shall destroy the Church of God,
overthrow the Christian race, and then forthwith shall come
the day of judgment.

" But in the days of this Antichrist there shall be many Chris-
tians who shall live in the caverns of the earth, and in the

N 2

solitary places of the rocks, and shall preserve the Christian
faith in the fear of the Lord, until the consummation of Anti-
christ ; and this is meant where it is said : " The woman fled
into the wilderness of Egypt, where she had a place prepared
of God, that they should feed her there, a thousand two hun-
dred and sixty days ; and her man child shall rule all nations
with a rod of iron." This is especially our Lord Jesus Christ,
who after His Passion and Eesurrection, has ascended into
heaven, and sits at the right hand of God the Father Almighty,
and shall come to judge the living and the dead, and the world
by fire ; of whom, if we are followers, and shall continue to
obey His commands, we shall be caught up into the air to meet
him, and shall always be with him."

But although the said abbat of Curazzo gave these opinions
in relation to Antichrist, still "Walter, archbishop of Rouen,
and the archbishop of Apamia, Gerard, archbishop of Auxienne,
John, bishop of Evreux, Bernard, bishop of Bayeux, and other
ecclesiastical men of great learning in the Holy Scriptures,
endeavoured to prove the contrary ; and although they brought
forward many arguments on both sides, with strong indications
of truthfulness, the dispute is still undecided. For the an-
cients, when making mention of Antichrist in their writings,
have written to the following effect :

" Those persons who wish to know something about Anti-
christ, ought first to mark why he has been so called. The
reason is, because he will be the opposite of Christ in all
things, and will do what is contrary to Christ. Christ came
in humility, he will come in pride. Christ came to raise the
humble and to justify sinners ; on the other hand, Antichrist
will cast down the humble, and will magnify sinners, will
exalt the unrighteous, and will always teach those vices which
are opposed to virtues, will destroy the law of the Gospel, will
recall to the world the worship of devils, will seek his own
glory, and will call himself " the Almighty God." This Anti-
christ will therefore have many to serve him in his wicked-
ness, of whom many have already preceded him in the world;
such as Antiochus, Nero, and Domitian ; in our times too we
know of many Antichrists. Whatever person, whether lay-
man, whether monk, or whether canon, lives contrary to the
laws of righteousness, and impugns the rules of his order, and
blasphemes that which is good, he is Antichrist and a minister
of Satan. But now as to the origin of Antichrist." What



A.D. 1190. DESCRIPTION OF ANTICHRIST. 181

I am saying, I am not coining out of my own imagination, or
inventing ; for in reading over books with care, I find all these
things there written.

According to what our authors say, Antichrist shall be born
after the example of the Jews, namely, of the tribe of Dan,
according to the prophecy that says : "Dan shall be a serpent
by the way, an adder in the path ;" 98 for like a serpent shall
he lie in the way, and be in the path, that he may smite those
who walk in the path of justice, and may slay them with the
venom of his malice. He shall also be born from the inter-
course of a father and mother, just like other men, and not, as
some say, of a virgin alone. But still, in sin shall he be
wholly conceived ; in sin shall he be begotten, and in sin shall
he be born. At the very moment of his conception, the devil
shall at the same time enter the womb of his mother ; and by
means of the Devil will he be cherished and protected in the
womb of his mother, and the power of the Devil will always
be with her. And just as the Holy Ghost came upon the
Mother of 'our Lord, and overshadowed her by his efficacy, and
filled her with his divine power that so she might conceive by
the Holy Ghost, and that what should be born might be sacred
and holy ; so also the Devil shall descend upon the mother of
Antichrist, and shall fill her entirely, surround her entirely,
hold her entirely, possess her entirely, within and without, to
the end that, the devil working through man, she may con-
ceive ; and what shall be born shall be entirely noxious, entirely
evil, entirely wicked.

In consequence hereof, this man is also called " the son of per-
dition ;" because, so far as he possibly can, he shall bring man-
kind to perdition, and last of all he himself shall come to per-
dition. Behold ! now you have heard how he shall be born, hear
also the place where he shall be born. For, as our Lord and
Redeemer in His foresight provided Bethlehem as the place
where He should deign to assume humanity in our behalves,
and be born, so the Devil knows of a fitting place for that
wicked man who is called Antichrist, from which the root of
all evils may take its rise, that is to say, the city of Babylon.
For in this city, which was formerly a renowned and glorious
city of the Gentiles, and the capital of the kingdom of Persia,
Antichrist will be born, and it is said that he will be nourished
and brought up in the cities of Bethsaida and Chorazin ; to
9 * Gen. xlix. 17.



182 AITOALS OF ROGER DE HOVEDEN. A. D. 1190,

which cities our Lord speaks in terms of censure, saying:
" Woe unto thee, Bethsaida ! woe unto thee, Chorazin !"

Antichrist will also have magicians, sorcerers, diviners and
enchanters, who, the Devil so inspiring them, will nurture him
and educate him in all iniquities and falsehood, and in the
foul art, and evil spirits shall be his guides, associates, and
sole companions. Then shall they come to Jerusalem, and all
Christians whom he shall not be enabled to convert to his own
ways, he will slay with various torments, and will prepare to
make his abode in the holy Temple. The Temple also which
was destroyed, and which Solomon dedicated to God, he shall
restore to its former state, and shall circumcise himself, and
shall lyingly assert that he is the son of Almighty God. Kings
and princes also will he first make converts of, and then
through them, of other persons ; while he will travel over the
places where our Lord Christ walked, and will first lay waste
what the Lord so rendered glorious. Then, throughout the
whole world will he send forth his messengers and his preachers.
And his preaching and power shall extend from sea to sea,
from east to west, from north to south. Many signs therefore
will he give, great and unheard-of miracles ; he will cause fire
to come in a dreadful manner from heaven, trees to blossom in
a moment and then to wither away, the sea to be aroused and
suddenly to be tranquillized, the natural forms of things to be
changed into various shapes ; the courses and tides of rivers to
be changed, the air to be agitated with winds and commotions,
besides innumerable other things of wondrous nature. The
dead shall even be raised in the sight of men, so that, if pos-
sible, even the elect may be led into error. For when they
shall behold signs so great and of such a nature, even those
who are perfect and the elect of God, shall be in doubt, whether
or not this is Christ, who, according to the Scriptures, was to
come at the end of the world.

But he shall cause persecution in every clime against the
Christians and all the elect ; and shall upraise himself against
the faithful in three ways ; that is to say, by terror, by gifts,
and by miracles. To those who believe *in him he will give
abundance of gold and of silver ; those whom he shall not be
able to corrupt with bribes he will conquer by terror : those
whom he shall not be able to conquer by terror, he will at-
tempt to lead astray by signs and miracles ; and those upon
whom by signs and miracles he can make no effect, he will

torment, and, in the sight of all, destroy by a cruel death.
Then shall there be tribulation, such as has not been upon the
earth from the time when nations began to be, until that time ;
then shall those who are in the field flee to the mountains,
and he who shall be above shall not come down into his house,
to take anything away therefrom.

Then shall every faithful Christian who shall be found,
either deny God, or die by the sword, or by the fire of the
furnace, or by serpents, or by beasts, or by some other kind
of torment, if he shall persist in the faith. This terrible and
fearful tribulation shall continue throughout the whole world
three years and a half. Then shall the days be shortened on
account of the elect ; for if the Lord should not shorten the
days, all flesh would not be saved.

The time also when Antichrist shall come, as well as when
the day of judgment shall begin to appear, the Apostle Paul
points out in his Epistle to the Thessalonians, where he says,
" "We beseech you by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ ;" s
and he reveals in the passage where he says, " Except there be
a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of
perdition." 1 We know also that after the kingdom of the
Greeks, as also after the kingdom of the Persians, each of
which, at its own season, gained great glory, and flourished
amid great power, at length, after other kingdoms as well, the
kingdom of the Romans began, and that it was more mighty
than all the former kingdoms, and held all the kingdoms of the
earth in subjection to it, and all nations and peoples were
tributary to the Eomans. Hence it is that the Apostle Paul
says that Antichrist will not come into the world, " Except
there be first a falling away;" that is, unless all the kingdoms
of the world should first revolt from the Roman empire to whom
they were before subject. This time, however, has not come
as yet ; for although we see the Roman empire in a great
measure destroyed, still, so long as the kings of the Franks
hold dominion, who are bound to uphold the empire of Rome,
the dignity of Rome will not entirely perish, for by its kings
will it be upheld.

Some, indeed, of our learned men assert that one of the kings

of the Franks will hold the Roman empire afresh, and in all its

integrity, who will exist at a very late period of time ; and he

himself will be the greatest and the last of all the kings, and

69 2 Thess. ii. 1. 2 Thess. ii. 3.



184 ANNALS OF EOGEH EE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1190-

after he shall have happily ruled over his own kingdom, shall
come at last to Jerusalem, and shall lay down his sceptre and
his crown on the Mount of Olives. This will be the end of the
empire of the Romans, and of the Christians, and immediately,
according to the words of Saint Paul the Apostle quoted above,
they say that Antichrist will come, and then will be revealed
Antichrist, the man of sin, who, though he shall be but a
man, shall still be the source of all sinfulness and the son of
perdition, which means the son of the Devil, not, indeed, by
nature, but by reason of imitation ; for in everything will he
fulfil the wishes of the Devil ; because the fulness of the dia-
bolical power, and of the whole of his evil disposition, shall
corporeally find an abode in him, in whom will be all the trea-
sures of wickedness and iniquity stored away, and who shall
strive against Christ, that is to say, shall be opposed to Him,
and all his members. " And he is exalted," meaning that he
is elated with pride ; " above everything that is called God,"
which means " above all the gods of the Gentiles ;" Hercules, to
wit, and Apollo, Jupiter, and Mercury ; above all those whom
the pagans suppose to be divinities Antichrist shall be raised ;
for he will make himself greater and more powerful than, them
all. And not only above these will he be raised, but above
everything that is worshipped ; above the Holy Trinity even,
which alone ought to be worshipped and adored by all crea-
tures he shall so raise himself, that he shall sit in the Temple
of the Lord, and show himself as though he were a God. For,
as we have said above, being born in the city of Babylon, he
shall come to Jerusalem, and shall circumcise himself, and
shall say to the Jews, " I am the Christ who was promised to
you again and again, who have come for your salvation, to the
end that I may gather together and defend you who are dis-
persed."

Then will all the Jews resort to him, thinking that they are
receiving God, whereas they will be receiving the Devil. But
even in the Temple of God shall Antichrist sit, that is to say,
in the Holy Church, making martyrs of all the Christians ; and
he shall be exalted and shall be magnified, because in him shall
be the Devil, the source of all wickedness, who is also king
over all the sons of vanity. But in order that Antichrist may
not come suddenly and unexpectedly, and at the same moment
deceive the whole of mankind with his errors, and so bring
them to ruin before his rising, two great prophets shall be



A.D. 1190. WHEKE ANTICHRIST SHALL BE SLAIN. 185

sent into the world, Enoch and Elias, who, against the attacks
of Antichrist, shall fortify the faithful of God with Divine
arms, and shall provide them, and. shall strengthen and prepare
the elect for battle ; and they shall teach and preach for three
years and a half. The sons also of Israel, such as shall at that
season be found, these two great prophets and teachers, shall
turn to the grace of the faith, and on the side of the elect shall
render them insuperable by the force of a whirlwind of such
mighty power. Then shall be fulfilled that which the Scrip-
ture says, " Though the number of the children of Israel be as
the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved." 2 After they
shall have fulfilled the time of their preaching three years and
a half, then shall the persecution by Antichrist begin to rage,
and against them the first thing of all shall Antichrist take up
arms, and shall slay them, as we read in the book of Eevelation ;
" And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast
that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against
them, and shall overcome them and kill them." 3 Then, after
these two shall have been slain, he shall persecute the rest
of the faithful, that so he may make them either glorious mar-
tyrs or apostates, and then shall those who believe in him
receive the impression of his mark on their foreheads.

But as we have spoken thus at large about his rise, let us
now say what end he is to have. Now, this Antichrist, the son of
the Devil, and the most vile contriver of all wickedness, shall, for
three years and a half, as already mentioned, harass the whole
world with great persecutions, and shall with various punish-
ments torment all the people of God ; and after he shall have
slain Elias and Enoch, and shall have crowned the rest with
martyrdom, who remain in the faith, at last shall come upon
him the judgment of God, as Saint Paul writes, saying, " Whom
the Lord Jesus shall consume with the spirit of His mouth ;" 4
or else the Lord shall kill him there with the power of his
command, or Michael, the Archangel, shall slay him with the
might of the Lord ; for he shall be slain by the might of
some angel or Archangel. They say also that Antichrist shall
be slain on a mountain in Babylon, upon his throne, in that
place opposite to which the Lord ascended into heaven. But
you should know that after Antichrist shall have been slain,
the day of judgment will not come immediately, the Lord will
not come immediately to judge us ; but, as we understand from ,
2 Rom. ix. 27. 3 Rev. xi. 7. 4 2 Thess. ii. 8.






186 A.KXALS OF B.OGER DE HOVTDEJf. A.D. 1190.

the book of Daniel, the Lord will give a day to the elect, that
they may perform penance, because they have been led astray
by Antichrist. But after they shall have duly performed this
penance, there is no one who knows how long a space of time
shall intervene before the Lord shall come to judge mankind ;
but it remains subject to the determination of God at what
hour God shall judge the world, inasmuch as before the world
began He pre-ordained that it should be judged.

John the Apostle and Evangelist, one of virgin purity and
the chosen of the Lord, and more beloved than the rest, asked
the Lord as to the end of the world, and the Lord made answer, 5
" The sun shall be turned to darkness, and the moon to blood,
and from the trees blood shall drop ; the stones shall send forth
voices, the people shall be aroused, and Antichrist, that is, the
Devil, shall reign, and shall work miracles and great signs in
the people ; no one shall be able to escape from him. He shall
be born of a woman who is a harlot of the tribe of Dan in
Israel. All those who believe in him he shall mark with his
mark on the forehead, and no one shall be able to blot out the
work of his hands. He shall be brought up in Chorazin, and
shall afterwards dwell in the city of Bethsaida ; and in a few
days both all those whom he shall kill, as also those who shall
die under his power of famine and thirst, shall be the elect
of God ; he will raise the false ones who are dead, 6 he will
turn back rivers in their course, he will pluck up trees by the
roots, and will turn the branches to the earth, and their roots
upwards, and by his diabolical arts make them blossom.
Many he will lead astray. On the day on which he shall be
born, all who dwell in the four quarters of the world will
know that he has been born ; the Scripture bearing witness
thereto, which says, " In every house the carcase of one dead
man shall be a sign." 7

Then in his time shall the father slay the son, and the son
the father, and the brother the brother, and the faithful shall
be found wanting in all things. Women shall be menstruous,
and shall not hide themselves from men ; the churches shall be
destroyed, the priests shall mourn, no memorials will be preserved

6 It need hardly be said that this answer, given to Saint John, only ex-
isted in the author's imagination, or was conveyed in some monkish legend.
It is probably based on Rev. vi. 12.

6 This seems to be the meaning of " suscitabit falsos mortuos."

7 Probably alluding to the words of Gen. xii. 30.

of the places where the bodies of the Saints have rested ; people
shall adore profane idols, like pagans, and Jews, and Saracens.
Nation shall arise against nation, and one kingdom against
another, and there shall be great earthquakes in divers places,
and pestilence and famine, and the stars shall fall down upon
the earth; rivers shall be changed into blood, and all the
waters which are below the heavens.

In his reign two prophets, namely, Enoch and Elias, shall
wage war against him, who are now sorrowing in Paradise
at the contemplation of death, and Antichrist shall slay them,
and they shall lie dead in the streets of the city during three
days and three nights, and on the fourth day they shall rise
again to life everlasting. At the last, Almighty God, who
wishes that all should be saved, shall send Michael, the Arch-
angel, having a sharp two-edged sword in his hands, that is to
say, the sword of the Holy Spirit, and shall slay him, and shall
cleave him into two parts from head to foot, that so the world
may not be destroyed, but may be renewed for the better ;
three years and six months shall it thus be in the bringing of
the world to a state of perfection. 8

In the same year, Richard, king of England, gave to his
nephew Otho, son of his sister Matilda, formerly duchess of
Saxony, the earldom of Evreux, and although many would
have received him and have done to him homage and fealty,
still many resisted him, declaring that they would not with-
draw from their fealty to the king, before they had spoken to
him face to face. In consequence of this, our lord the king
gave to the said Otho the earldom of Poitou by way of ex-
change for the earldom of Evreux.

In the same year, Sancho, king of Portugal, gave his daughter
Tarsia in marriage to Alphonso, king of Saint Jago, his ne-
phew ; he had by her three sons, and though pope Celestinus
used all possible endeavours that they might be separated, he
still adhered to her in spite of God and the prohibition of our
lord the pope for a period of five years ; accordingly, our lord the
pope Celestinus placed the said king of Saint Jago under an in-
terdict, and so he remained for five years. In the meantime,

however, Alphonso, king of Castille, arose against the said
king of Saint Jago, and compelled him to relinquish his wife,
the daughter of the king of Portugal, and hy the persuasion of
pope Celestinus, for the sake of peace, gave him his own
daughter to wife.

In process of time, the daughter of Boyac El Emir Amimoli,
emperor of Africa, having heard from common report of the
prowess of Sancho, king of Navarre, brother of Berengaria,
queen of England, fell in love with him to such a degree, that
she greatly longed to have him as her husband. When she
was unable any longer to conceal her designs, she told her
father, the emperor, that she would hang herself unless Sancho,
king of Navarre, would have her for his wife ; on which her
father made answer, " How can that be effected, seeing that you
are a pagan 9 and he a Christian ?" To this his daughter made
answer, " Indeed I am quite ready to embrace the Christian
faith, and to live conformably to their laws, if I only have the
king of Navarre for my husband, a thing which, my dear father,
can easily be brought about by you. For all stand in awe of
you, and extend their arms to you; still, there is need of
blandishment; away with all fury and intimidation; send
entreaties and gifts to this man, that by such means you may
gain him for me. ' Believe me, 'tis a noble thing to give.' 10
Send also to his mother and sister, and the rest of his family,
bounteous presents, in order that they may allow him to assent
to your proposals. ' The prey that's sought by many hands is
speedily obtained.' " u

On this, her father made answer : " ' While you were guile-

fless, I loved your body and your mind ; now, is your beauty
blemished by the vices of your disposition.' la What to do I
know not, for I am in difficulties on every side. For if the
king of Navarre shall fail to return your passion, then you
will hang yourself. I will therefore attempt to prevail upon
him by entreaties and various presents, that so I may gain him
in some way or other as a husband for you. Still, I would much
rather that you would take a husband of our own nation." The

" Crede mihi res est ingeniosa dare." A singular thing, for a Maho-
medan lady to quote Ovid.

answer of the damsel to this was-, " ' May I be rather devoured
by the yawning earth, I pray, or burned by the gleaming
flames of the hurled thunderbolt, 13 than that I should take
any man for my husband but the king of Navarre.' "

Accordingly, the emperor of Africa sent envoys to Sancho,
king of Navarre, by whom he begged that he would come to him,
for the purpose of marrying his daughter, and he would give
him as much money as he should desire, besides the whole of
the land that lies between the extremities of the territory of
the king of Portugal and the mountain of Muncian, which
divides the territories of the Pagans in Spain from those of
the king of Arragon. But while the king of Navarre was on
the way to him, Boyac El Emir Amimoli, emperor of Africa,
died ; so that when the said king of Navarre arrived in Africa
he found the emperor dead, and the son of the emperor as yet
but a little child, and not fit to govern the kingdom ; while
there were many competitors with him for the empire.

On the king of Navarre coming to him, fully expecting that
he should receive the damsel before-mentioned as his wife, the
boy who was to reign said to him, that if he was ready to
assist him and to serve him in his endeavours to obtain the
empire, he would give him his sister in accordance with the
promises of his father ; but if not, he would place him in con-
finement, from which he should never be released. Seeing
himself thus placed in a dilemma, he chose to serve under him
rather than be placed in confinement ; in conformity with the
maxim of Saint Augustin ; " When a person is shut up within
walls that he may not escape, let him precipitate himself from
the part where the wall is lowest." Accordingly, the Lord
granting it, and Sancho, king of Navarre, using his best en-
deavours, the son of the Emir Amimoli within three years
subdued all his adversaries, and became emperor. In the mean-
time, Alphonso, king of Castille, and the king of Arragon, in-
vaded the territories of the said king of Navarre, one of them
on one side, the other on the other ; in consequence of which,
Alphonso, king of Castille, took from him twenty-four towns,
and the king of Arragon eighteen.

In the year of grace 1191, being the second year of the reign
of king Richard, the said king Eichard, and Philip, king of
the Franks, were together at Messina, in Sicily, on the day of

the Nativity of our Lord, which fell on the third day of
the week. On the same day, after dinner, the Pisano and
Genevese seditiously made an attack upon the galleymen of
Bichard, king of England, and a slaughter took place on both
sides. The noise of this accordingly reached the ears of the
king of England, who was still sitting at table in his castle
of Mate Griffon ; and on this day there were feasting with
him Eeginald, bishop of Chartres, Hugh, duke of Burgundy,
William count de Nevers, "William count de Juvigny, Geof-
frey count of Perche, and many others of the household of the
king of France. The tables being instantly set aside, all these
persons arose, and went out with the king fully armed, for the
purpose of putting an end to the fight, which, however, they were
unable to do ; but, night coming on, the parties were separated
from each other till the morning. On the following day, when
the people had assembled in the church of Saint John of the
Hospital, to hear Divine service there, a certain Pisan, drawing
his knife, slew one of the galleymen of the king in the church ;
on which a conflict took place a second time between the
Pisans and the galleymen, and multitudes were slain on both
sides. Upon this, the king of France and the king of England
came with a large body of armed men, and made peace be-
tween them.

After this, in the month of February, on the day of the
Purification of Saint Mary ever a Virgin, being Saturday,
after dinner, Richard, king of England, and many of his house-
hold, and some of the people of the household of the king of
France, assembled after their usual manner, outside of the
walls of the city of Messina, to view the games of the people ;
and when they were returning home, as they passed through
the middle of the city, they met a peasant coming from the
country with an ass laden with reeds which they call " canes ;"
of which the king of England and the others who were with
him each took one, and engaged with one another. It so
happened that the king of England and William de Barres,
one of the bravest knights of the household of the king of
France, engaged with each other, and broke their reeds,
while the head-piece of the king of the English was broken by
a blow from William de Barres ; at which the king being en-
raged, made an attack upon him with such violence that it
made him and his horse stumble ; but, while the king was
trying to throw him to the ground, the king's saddle slipped,

on which he dismounted in all haste, and another horse was
brought him, stouter than the first. Mounting it, he again
made an attack upon William de Barres and tried to throw him
down, but was not able, as he kept fast hold of the horse's
neck, on which the king uttered threats against him.

Upon this, Robert de Breteuil, son of Eobert, earl of Leicester,
whom the king the previous day had girded with the sword of
his father's earldom, was for laying hands on William de Barres
that he might help his master, but the king said to him, " Hold,
and leave me and him alone." After William and the king
had contended for a considerable time, both in words and deeds,
the king said to him, "Away with you hence, and take care
that you never appear in my presence again, for at heart I
shall for everlasting be the enemy of you and yours." Upon
this, William de Barres departed from the king's presence grieved
and in confusion, in consequence of the king's indignation, and
went to his lord the king of France, to ask his advice and as-
sistance upon the matter that had thus happened on the road.

On the next day the king of France came to the king of Eng-
land, on behalf of William de Barres, with humble entreaties on
his part, asking for peace and mercy on behalf of William de
Barres, but the king refused to listen to him. On the third
day after this, William de Barres took his departure from
the city of Messina ; for his lord, the king of Prance, was un-
willing to keep him any longer with him, contrary to the wish
and prohibition of the king of England. However, after a
considerable time had intervened, and the time for embark-
ing was drawing nigh, the king of France and all the arch-
bishops, bishops, earls and barons, and chief men of the
army, again came to the king of England, and, falling at his
feet, asked for peace and mercy on his part on behalf of Wil-
liam de Barres, showing the losses and inconveniences that
might result in consequence of the absence of a knight of such
character and prowess; and after great difficulty they ob-
tained from the king of England that the said William might
return in peace, and the king of England would do no harm to
either him or his, or make enquiry about them so long as they
should be in the service of their lord.

After this, the king of England made present of many ships
to the king of France and his own people, and distributed
his treasures with such profuseness among all the knights
and men-at-arms of his whole army, that it was said by

many that not one of his predecessors had ever given so muck
in a whole year, as he gave away in that month. And cer-
tainly we have reason to believe that by this munificence he
gained the favour of Him who sends his thunders, as it is
written : " God loveth a cheerful giver." 15

In the same month of February, the king of England sent
his galleys to Naples, to meet queen Eleanor his mother, and
Berengaria, daughter of Sancho, king of Navarre, whom he
was about to marry, and Philip, earl of Flanders, who was
coming with them. However, the king's mother and the
daughter of the king of Navarre went on to Brindisi, where
Margarite, the admiral, and other subjects of king Tancred,
received them with due honor, and showed them all considera-
tion and respect. The earl of Flanders, however, came to
Naples, and finding there the galleys of the king of England,
embarked in them and came to Messina, and in many matters
followed the advice and wishes of the king of England ; at
which the king of France being enraged, prevailed upon the
earl to leave the king of England and return to him.

In the mean time, a serious difference happened in England
between the king's chancellor and John, earl of Mortaigne, the
king's brother, and the other principal men of the kingdom ;
which increased to such a pitch that they all wrote to the king
relative to the state of his kingdom, and the excesses that the
said chancellor was guilty of toward the people of his king-
dom. Accordingly, when the king heard of the excesses and
annoyances that the chancellor was guilty of towards his
people, he sent to England from Messina, Walter, archbishop
of llouen, and William Marshal, earl of Striguil, with com-
mands to the chancellor that in all business of the kingdom
he should have the said archbishop of Rouen, and William
Marshal, Geoffrey FitzPeter, William Bruere, and Hugh Bar-
dolph, as his associates and witnesses. On their arrival in
England, these persons did not dare deliver their letters to the
chancellor, fearing lest they should rather incur his hatred,
than derive honor therefrom. For the chancellor set at nought
all the king's commands, and would have no one an equal with
himself, or any associate in the kingdom.

On the first day of the month of March, Richard, king of
England, left Messina, and proceeded thence to the city of
Catania (where rests the most holy body of Saint Agatha the
15 2 Cor. ix. 7.

VOL. II.






194 ANNALS OF ROGER DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1191.

Virgin and Martyr), for the purpose of holding a conference
with Tancred, king of Sicily, who had come thither to meet
him. Accordingly, king Tancred, on hearing of the approach
of the king of England, went forth to meet him, and with the
greatest reverence and the honor due to his royal excellency
received and introduced him into the city. As they were going
together towards the tomb of Saint Agatha the Martyr, at the
entrance of the church, they were met by the clergy and people,
praising and blessing the Lord who had united them in the
bonds of such brotherly love. After having offered up his
prayers at the tomb of Saint Agatha, the king of England
entered the palace of king Tancred, together with him, and
stayed there three days and nights.

On the fourth day the king of Sicily sent to the king of
England many presents of great value, consisting of gold and
silver, horses and silken cloths ; but he would receive nothing
from him except a little ring, which he accepted as a token of
their mutual esteem. On the other hand, the king of England
gave to king Tancred that most excellent sword which the
Britons called " Calibum," and which had been the sword of
Arthur, once the valiant king of England. King Tancred
also gave to the king of England four large ships, which they
call "ursers," and fifteen gallies; and when the king of
England left him, he escorted him back to Taverni, two long
days' journey from the city of Catania.

On the following day, when the king of England was pre-
paring to take his leave, king Tancred gave him a certain
document, which the king of Erance had sent to him by the
duke of Burgundy, and had therein stated that the king of
England was a traitor, and had not kept the treaty of peace
which he had made with him, and that if king Tancred was
willing to go to war with the long of England, or to attack him
by night, he and his people would give him aid against the
king of England, for the purpose of destroying his army.

On this, the king of England made answer, " I am not a
traitor, nor have I been, nor will I be ; the peace which I made
with you I have in no way broken, nor will I break it so long
as I live ; and I cannot easily bring myself to believe that the
king of France did send you this about me, as he is my liege
lord, and my sworn associate in this pilgrimage." To this
king Tancred made answer and said, " I give you the letter
which he himself sent me by the duke of Burgundy; and



A.D. 1191. AGEEEMENT BETWEEN RICHAUD AND PHILIP. 195

if the duke of Burgundy denies that he brought me that
letter on behalf of his lord the king of Prance, I am quite
ready to make proof of the same against him by one of my
captains." Upon this, with the letter so received at the
hands of king Tancred, the king of England returned to Mes-
sina.

On the same day, the king of France came to Taverni, and
had an interview with king Tancred, and after remaining with
him one night, on the next day returned to Messina. The
king of England, being aroused to anger against the king of
France, showed him a countenance neither joyous nor be-
tokening peace, but sought an opportunity of withdrawing
from him with his people. Consequently, the king of France
made enquiry why this was done ; on which the king of Eng-
land, by Philip, earl of Flanders, informed him of every word
that the king of Sicily had said to him about the king ; and,
as a proof of the fact, showed the letter already mentioned.
On this becoming known to the king of France, having a bad
conscience on the matter, he at first held his peace, not know-
ing what to say in return. At length, however, having re-
covered his self-possession, he said :

" Now do I know of a truth that the king of England is
seeking pretexts for speaking ill of me, for these words are
forged and false. But he has invented these evil charges
against me, I suppose, that he may get rid of my sister Alice,
whom he has sworn that he will marry ; but let him know this
for certain, if he does put her aside and marry another woman,
I will be the enemy of him and his so long as I live." On
hearing this, the king of England made answer, that he would
on no account whatever take his sister to wife ; inasmuch as
the king of England, his own father, had been intimate with
her, and had had a son by her ; and he produced many wit-
nesses to prove the same, who were ready by all manner of
proof to establish that fact.

When this became known to the king of France, through
the information of many persons, by the counsel of the earl of
Flanders and others of his faithful advisers, he acquiesced
therein; and that all disputes between him and the king of
England, both on this point as well as on all others, might
be put an end to, he released the king of England from his
promises and oaths, and all covenants which he had entered
into with him as to being united in marriage with his sister

Alice : and, in consideration of this treaty, the king of Eng-
land promised that he would pay yearly, for the next five
years, two thousand marks sterling; of which, at the beginning
of the treaty, he paid to the king of France two thousand
marks. Also, when they should have returned to their own
territories, the king of England was to deliver to the king of
France his sister Alice, and Gisors and all the other places that
the king of France had granted him as a marriage portion with
his sister. Also, by virtue of this treaty, the king of France
gave to the king of England leave to marry whomsoever he
should choose ; and granted to him, and conferred the same by
his charter, that the dukedom of Brittany should always belong
to the demesne of the duke of Normandy, and that the duke
of Brittany should always be a liegeman of the duke of Nor-
mandy, and be answerable to him as his liege lord, and the
duke of Normandy should be answerable to the king of France
both as to the dukedom of Brittany as well as the dukedom of
Normandy. Accordingly, on that day the king of France and
the king of England were made friends, and confirmed all those
covenants with good faith, and upon oath, with the testimony
of their seals.

In the same month of March, on the third day before the
calends of April, being Saturday, Philip, king of France, left
the port of Messina with all his fleet ; and on the twenty-
second day following, that is to say, the Saturday in Easter
week, he arrived with his army at the siege of Acre. The
king of England, however, and his army remained at Mes-
sina after the departure of the king of France. On the same
day also on which the king of France left Messina, queen
Eleanor arrived there, the mother of Eichard, king of England,
bringing with her Berengaria, daughter of Sancho, king of
Navarre, whom the said king of England was to marry : on
the fourth day after which, the said queen Eleanor again re-
turned on her way to England, with the intention of passing
through Home, to treat of the business of Geoffrey, the arch-
bishop elect of York ; for, through her the king of England
sent word to the Supreme Pontiff, and humbly entreated him
to confirm the election of the said Geoffrey and consecrate him
archbishop of York, or else to allow him to be consecrated by
some one else. On the departure of queen Eleanor, the daughter
of the king of Navarre remained in the charge of the king of Eng-
land, with Joanna, queen of Sicily, the sister of the said king.






A.D. 1191. TUSCULANUM IS RESTORED TO THE ROMANS. 197

In the month of April, on the fourth day before the ides of
the said month, being the fourth day of the week, pope Cle-
ment the Third departed this life, and was succeeded by Jacinto, 16
cardinal deacon of the church of Saint Mary in Cosmedim ;
and on the vigil of Easter he was ordained priest, and on
Easter day, which fell on the eighteenth day before the calends
of May, was consecrated Pontiff of Rome, by Octavianus, bishop
of Ostia, being called pope Celestinus the Third. On the day
after his consecration, our lord the pope went from the Late-
ran to the church of Saint Peter, where he was met by
Henry, king of Germany, with his wife Constance, and a
large body of men-at-arms. The Romans, however, shut the
city gates, and guarded them with a strong hand, and in arms,
and would not allow them to enter.

Accordingly, our lord the pope, before the door of the church
of Saint Peter, upon the steps, received the oath of the said
king of the Germans, that he would faithfully preserve the
Church of God, and the rights of the Church inviolate, and
would observe strict justice, and would, if anything should be
taken thence, replace the patrimony of Saint Peter in its former
integrity, and would restore to him Tusculanum. 17 Our lord the
pope then led them into the church, and anointed him emperor,
and his wife empress. The pope sat in the pontifical chair,
holding the imperial crown of gold between his feet, and the
emperor, baring his head, received the crown, and in like man-
ner the empress received her crown, at the feet of our lord the
pope. Our lord the pope also suddenly struck the crown of
the emperor with his foot, and overturned it on the ground,
signifying thereby that he possessed the power of casting him
down from his throne if he should show himself unworthy ;
but the cardinals, immediately picking up the crown, placed it
on the head of the emperor.

In order that the reason may be known why our lord the
pope Celestinus restored to the Romans their city of Tusculanum,
we must repeat a few circumstances that had previously tran-
spired. When the lord Clement, the bishop of Palestrina, was
elected and consecrated Supreme Pontiff, according to custom,
at Pisa, where Gregory the Eighth, of pious memory, had de-
parted from this world unto the Lord, the- said lord Clement,
without delay, sent his envoys to the citizens of Rome, repru-

198 AXXALS OF ROGER DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1191.

senting that a most strict treaty of peace ought again to be en-
tered into between them. For a dispute had arisen with refer-
ence to Tusculanum, which is a city that belongs to our lord the
pope, about ten miles distant from Eome, and which the Eomans
were attacking incessantly in war, that they might render
it subject to themselves. By means, also, of these conflicts
that took place between Eome and Tusculanum, more than five
thousand Eoinans had in one day fallen by the sword, and, from
the time of pope Alexander to that of the said Clement, these
disputes had lasted between the Church and the Eomans. The
envoys, on coming to the city, entreated the Eomans, like af-
fectionate sons, to turn their hearts to their spiritual father,
and most dutifully make it their care to receive him, on his
return to them, as a kind father, and represented that it was
befitting that they should be, as it were, but one for the future.
To this the Eomans made answer, to the following effect :
" This, inasmuch as it is holy and becoming, with ardent de-
sire we greatly wish to be done, without any delay whatever,
even more than our lord and father does, and like true and
humble sons ; but still, only on condition that, equally with
ourselves, he shall wish reparation to be made for our losses,
and our injuries and affronts to be avenged, which, in conse-
quence of the war with Tusculanum, we have in the times of
our fathers endured, and do still endure ; and shall be ready, if
there shall be necessity for so doing, to send his soldiers at his
own expense, if peace cannot be made between us on terms
honorable to this city, for the subjection of Tusculanum ; an
agreement being entered into in writing for a yearly tribute to
be paid by Tusculanum to our city. He must also promise that,
in case there is a refusal on their part to make peace with us on
the terms before-mentioned, if at any future time he shall be
able to get Tusculanum into his power, he will be ready to give
it up to us, for the purpose of our wishes already expressed
being complied with.'*

Accordingly, on these and some other liberties being at
length conceded by that said pope Clement to the Eomans, the
said Clement came to the city, of which he was a native ; and
as the lord Clement did not find himself able, in conformity
with the above^stated request made by the Eomans, to render
Tusculanum subject to them, he made severe attacks upon that
place, exposing it to the assaults of the Eomans. Yet, although
he enjoyed the papacy for nearly four years, he was unable to



A.D. 1191. TUSCULANTTM DESTROYED. 199

bring this war with the Romans to a conclusion ; although the
Romans, posting themselves in ambush, took nearly the greater
portion of the people of Tusculanum prisoners, outside of their
fortifications, and slew them with various pains and tortures.
For some of those whom they took prisoners they put to
death at once, while others, first deprived of their feet, others
with their eyes put out, and others with their hands cut off
and hung from their necks, they sent back home : yet all these
evils they most resolutely affirmed they would endure, in pre-
ference to being subjected to the severity of the Romans.

After the death of Clement, when the lord Jacinto, the car-
dinal priest of Saint Mary in Cosmedim, afterwards called
Celestinus, was elected Supreme Pontiff in his stead, and
Henry, the then king, was hastening to Rome, having been
invited by pope Clement for that purpose, to receive the crown
of the empire, the Romans, before the said king had arrived
at the citj r , entreated the lord Celestinus, before he anointed
the said king emperor, to prevail upon him to restore to them
the city of Tusculanum, which was under his control ; (for its
people had betaken themselves to him, and had entreated his
protection, from the time that the above-named Clement had,
as already mentioned, left them to the mercy of the Romans).
They asserted to the said pope, with the greatest energy, that
this was the method by which Tusculanum would fall again
into their hands, and that he was bound by the compact already
mentioned so to do ; and this was accordingly conceded to
them.

Upon this, envoys from our lord the pope were sent to the
king, and most strongly urged him that, as the treaty before-
mentioned had been made relative to Tusculanum between the
Supreme Pontiff and the Romans, necessity consequently de-
manded that Tusculanum should be given up to our lord the
pope. Upon the king finding this to be the case, and per-
ceiving that, otherwise, great difficulties might easily be thrown
in the way of his coronation, he freely granted the request
of our lord the pope as to the delivery up to him of Tuscu-
lanum ; and, accordingly, the king having been crowned em-
peror, on the following day Tusculanum was delivered by the
said emperor to our lord the pope, and, on the third day after,
was, by the said pope and the citizens of Rome, levelled with
the ground ; so much so, that not one stone remained standing
upon another.



200 ANEALS OF EOGER DE HOVEDE2T. A.D. 1191.

In the meantime, in the month of April, Richard, king of
England, destroyed and levelled with the ground his castle
called Mate Griffon, before departing from Messina, in confor-
mity with the promise he had made to king Tancred : and on
the fourth day of the week, before the Supper of our Lord, he,
with the whole of his army, and his fleet, sailed ont of the
harbour of Messina, with a hundred and fifty large ships and
fifty-three galleys, well armed ; but, on the day of the Pre-
paration 18 of our Lord, about the ninth hour of the day, a
dreadful wind arose from the south, and dispersed his fleet.
The king, with a portion of the fleet, arrived at the island of
Crete, and afterwards at the island of Rhodes. A large buss,
however, in which were the queen of Sicily and the daughter
of the king of Navarre, with many of the king's household,
and two other busses, while the tempest was raging, reached
the island of Cyprus, the king being ignorant as to what had
been the fate of these busses.

After the tempest had abated, the king sent some galleys in
search of the busses on board of which was the queen, his
sister, and the daughter of the king of Navarre, and they found
them outside of the harbour of Limezun ; but the other two
busses which had accompanied them, and had arrived before
the harbour of Limezun, had gone down, having on board many
knights and men-at-arms of the king's household; among
whom, sad to tell! Master Roger Malchen, the king's vice-
chancellor, was drowned ; the king's seal, however, which he
wore suspended from his neck, was found. Upon this, Isaac,
emperor of Cyprus, laid hands upon the property of those who
were wrecked, and took and threw into prison all the persons
who toad escaped from the shipwreck, and seized their money;
and. in a spirit of more than diabolical cruelty, he would
not allow the buss on board of which were the queen of
Sicily and the daughter of the king of Navarre to enter the
harbour.

On the king of England being informed of this, he came
with all haste to their assistance, with a great number of
galleys and a vast fleet of ships, and found them outside the
harbour of Limezun, exposed to the winds and waves. Being
greatly enraged at this, he sent messengers to the emperor of
Cyprus, a first, second, and third time, begging and asking
with humble entreaties that, out of regard for the love of God,
18 . parasceues Domini." The day after Good Friday.

and respect for the Cross, the giver of life, he would allow His
pilgrims, whom he was keeping captive in chains, to depart
unhurt, and restore to them their property, and give up to him
the property of such of his subjects as had heen drowned, that
with the same he might perform service to God for their souls :
to which, however, the emperor haughtily made answer, and
said that he would neither give up the pilgrims nor the property
of the drowned.

The king, upon hearing that this wicked emperor would do
nothing for him unless forced so to do, commanded the whole
of his army to take up their arms, and, being fully armed, to
follow him, saying to them : " Follow me, that we may avenge
the injuries which this perfidious emperor has done to God and
to ourselves, who thus, against the justice and equity of God,
keeps our pilgrims in chains ; and fear them not, for they are
without arms, and better prepared for flight than for battle ;
whereas we are well armed, and to him who wields arms, he
yields up everything who denies him what is his right. We
are also bound to fight manfully against him, in order to deliver
the people of God from perdition, knowing that we must either
conquer or die. But I have full confidence in God, that He
will this day grant us the victory over this perfidious emperor
and his people."

In the meantime, the emperor with his people had taken up
their position in every direction on the sea-shore ; but a few
only of them were armed, and they were nearly all utterly un-
skilled in the art of warfare ; however, they stood on the shore,
armed with swords, and lances, and staves ; and having in
front of them logs and beams, and benches and chests, as a
defence. When the king of England and his people had
armed themselves, they disembarked from the great ships into
boats and galleys, and, rowing on, made for shore with exceed-
ing swiftness ; on which the archers, landing first, made way
for the others. After landing, the king leading the way, with
one accord they made an attack upon the emperor and his
Griffons, 19 and Uke a shower upon the grass did the arrows
fall upon those who fought ; but after the combat had lasted a
considerable time, the emperor and his people took to flight :
upon which the king of England pursued them with the edge
of the sword, and, making a great slaughter of them, took pri-

Europe to the Greeks of Byzantium.

soners many of those who offered resistance ; and had not the
night come on, in all probability, on that day the king would
have taken the emperor prisoner. But, as the king and his
people were on foot, and did not know the paths across the
mountains by which the emperor and his men took to flight,
they returned with a great booty to the city of Limezun, which
the Griffons had deserted ; and found in it an abundance of
corn, wine, oil, and flesh meat.

On the same day, after the victory gained by the king of
England, his sister, the queen of Sicily, and the daughter of
the king of Navarre, entered the harbour of Limezun with the
rest of the king's fleet. The emperor, however, collecting his
men, who had been dispersed in the valleys among the thickets
there, on the same night pitched his camp about five miles
from the army of the king of England, affirming, with an oath,
that he would the next day give battle to the king. On the
king being informed of this by means of his spies, long before
daybreak he had himself and his troops fully armed, and, going
forth without any noise, came up to the army of the emperor,
and found his people buried in sleep.

Upon this, he rushed into their tents with a loud and ter-
rible shout, on which, aroused from their slumbers, they be-
came as though dead men, not knowing what to do or whither
to fly ; for the army of the king of England came upon them
like ravening wolves, and made immense havoc among them.
The emperor, however, with a few of his people, made his
escape in a state of nudity, leaving behind him his treasures,
horses, arms, and tents of extreme beauty, together with his
imperial standard, embroidered all over the surface with gold,
which the king of England immediately determined to present
as an offering to Saint Edmund, the king and glorious Martyr.
Accordingly, the king of England, having gained a complete
victory, returned to Limezun, a mighty triumpher over his
foes.

On the third day after this, there came to the king of Eng-
land, in the isle of Cyprus, Guido, king of Jerusalem, Geoffrey
of Lusignan, 20 his brother, Amfrid de Tours, Raymond, prince
of Antioch, and Boamund his son, the earl of Tripolis, and
Leo, the brother of Eupin de la Montaigne, and, offering to the
king their services, did homage to him, and swore fealty to him
against all men. On the same day, the emperor of Cyprus,

seeing that he was entirely destitute of all valour and effica-
cious aid on the part of his troops, sent envoys to the king of
England with suppliant entreaties, and offered him peace on
the following terms, namely ; that he would give him twenty
thousand marks of gold in satisfaction of the monies that had
heen lost 21 in his ships, and would set at liberty those persons
who had been taken after the shipwreck, together with their
property, and would himself attend him personally to the land
of Jerusalem, and remain with him in the service of God and
of himself, together with one hundred knights, and four hun-
dred Turcopole horsemen, and five hundred foot soldiers well
armed ; in addition to which he would give him his daughter,
who was his sole heir, as a hostage, and deliver up to him his
castles by way of security, and would swear to observe his
fealty to him and his for ever, and hold his empire of him.

These terms being accordingly agreed to on both sides, the
emperor came to the king of England, and, in presence of the
king of Jerusalem, and the prince of Antioch, and his other
barons, did homage to the king, and swore fealty to him. He
also made oath that he would not leave him until all things
had been performed that had been so covenanted. Accord-
ingly, the king assigned tents to the emperor and his people,
and appointed knights and men-at-arms to keep guard over
them. On the same day, however, after dinner, the emperor
repented that he had made such terms with the king of Eng-
land, and while the knights, whose duty it was to keep guard
over him, were taking their mid-day nap, by stealth he took
his departure, and then sent word to the king that, thence-
forth, he would not be on terms of peace or concord with him ;
a thing that, as it appeared, greatly pleased the king.

Por he, like a wary and circumspect man, immediately gave
a part of his army to Guido and the prince of Antioch, and
the others who had come to him, and commanded them to
follow the emperor, and take him prisoner if they possibly
could; while the king himself, dividing his galleys into two
parts, gave one half of them to Robert de Turnham, and com-
manded him to surround the island on one side, and if he
should find any ships or galleys, to take them ; which was
accordingly done : while the king, with the remaining portion

21 The reading is more probably " submersorura," and not " submer-
sarum ;" alluding to the money of which the bodies of the drowned had
been plundered.

of his galleys, surrounded the other side ; and he and Robert
took all the ships and galleys they could find in the vicinity of
the island. On this, the garrisons of the cities, and castles, and
harbours, deserted them in every direction, wherever the king
and the said Robert came, and, taking to flight, concealed
themselves in the mountains. After this was done, the king
and Robert de Turnham returned to Limezun ; and king Guido,
and those who were with him, being unable to accomplish
their object, rejoined the king. In the meantime, the subjects
of the emperor nocked from all quarters to the king of Eng-
land, and acknowledged themselves his subjects, and held their
lands of him.

One day, when the above-named emperor was sitting at
dinner, and his nobles with him, one of them said to him,
" My lord, we advise you to make peace with the king of Eng-
land, that the whole of your nation may not be destroyed ;"
on which the emperor, being greatly enraged at these words,
struck at him with a knife which he was holding in his hand,
and cut off the nose of the person who had given him this
advice; whereupon, after dinner, the person who had been
struck, left him to go to the king of England, and became his
adherent.

On the fourth day before the ides of May, 22 being the Lord's
day and the feast of Saint Nereus, Saint Achilleus, and Saint
Pancratius the Martyrs, Berengaria, daughter of the king of
Navarre, was married to Richard, king of England, at Lime-
zun, 23 in the island of Cyprus, Nicholas, the king's chaplain,
performing the services of that sacrament ; and on the same
day the king caused her to be crowned and consecrated queen
of England by John, bishop of Evreux, he being assisted in
the performance of the ceremony by the archbishops of Apamea
and Auxienne, and the bishop of Bayonne.

After the celebration of the nuptials, the king of England
moved onward his army, and a fine city was surrendered to
him, which is called Mchosis ; and when the king had arrived
with his army before an extremely well fortified castle, which
is called Cherin, and in which was the emperor's daughter,
she went out to meet the king, and fell upon the ground be-
fore his feet, and surrendered to himjjae fiMtia" imploring
his mercy| on which the king took_compassion on her, and

present day.

sent her to the queen. After the king had moved onward
in his march, the castle was surrendered to him which is
known by the name of Baffes, as also the castle called Buffevent,
the castle called Deudeamur, and the castle called Candare ;
after which all the cities and fortresses of the empire were
surrendered to him. The wretched emperor, in the mean-
time, concealed himself in an extremely well fortified abbey,
called Cap Saint Andrew ; but, upon the king coming thither
for the purpose of taking him, jhe emperor went forth to meet
him, and throwing himself at his feet, placed himself at his
mercy for both life and limb, no mention being made of the
kingdom, as he knew that eveiy thing was now in the hands
and power of the king ; but his only request was, that he
might not 24 be placed in fetters and manacles of iron ; on which
the king listened to his request, and delivered him into the
charge of Ealph Fitz-Godfrey, his chamberlain, and ordered
fetters and manacles of silver and gold to be made for him.
All these things took place in the island of Cyprus in the"
month of July, on the first day of that month, being Saturday,
and the vigil of Pentecost.

All these matters being brought to a conclusion, the king of
England sent the emperor, with his guards, to the city of
Tripolis, and gave the island of Cyprus into the charge of
Richard de Camville and' Robert de Turnham. On the same
day, that is to say, on the vigil of Pentecost, Philip, earl of
Flanders, died at the siege of Acre, and the king of France, his
liege lord, seized all his treasures and property, and kept them
in his own possession, and from that hour sought an excuse
for withdrawing from the siege of Acre, and returning to his
country, that he might subjugate the earldom of Flanders.
On the same day also, that is to say, on the vigil of Pentecost,
the queen of England and the queen of Sicily, the sister of the
king of England, and the daughter of the emperor of Cyprus,
arrived before Acre with the greater part of the fleet of the
king of England.

In the meantime, the king of England received from all the
inhabitants of the island a moiety of all their goods, and con-
firmed for them the laws and institutions which they had in
the time of Manuel, the emperor of Constantinople. After
this, on the fourth day of the week of Pentecost, the king of
England left the island of Cyprus with his galleys, and on
81 " Non" is omitted in the text, evidently by mistake.

the following day arrived at Tyre, in the land of Sulia. How-
ever, the garrison of Tyre would not allow him to enter Tyre,
saying, that the king of France and Conrad, marquis of Tyre,
had forbidden his entrance into the city ; consequently he was
obliged for that night to lie in tents outside of the walls of
Tyre.

On the following day, being the sixth day of the week of
Pentecost, when he was on his way towards Acre, he saw at
sea before him a large buss laden with troops, and decked
out with the banners of the king of France and his associates ;
on which he sent two galleys to it and enquired whose ship
it was, and whence it came. They made answer, that they
were subjects of the king of France, and had come from An-
tioch, with the intention of going to the siege of Acre ; on
which those who had been sent returned with this answer to
the king of England ; when the king replied, " If they are
subjects of the king of France, go and tell them to wait and
speak to me." "While they were on their road back, the men
in the buss, being conscience-stricken, as in reality they were
all pagans, armed themselves, and received the messengers of
the king in a most hostile manner, discharging arrows against
them and Greek fire. Upon the king observing this, he came
nearer, and said to all who were about him, " Give chase
to them, and overtake them, and if you capture them, all
their property shall belong to you; but if they get away,
you will forfeit my regard for ever." Upon this, they all,
with one accord, made an attack upon the buss, and pierced
it on every side with the beaks of their galleys, on which, the
water effecting an entrance, it went to the bottom. "When the
pagans found that they were beginning to sink, they threw
their arms into the sea, and breaking the vessels, poured forth
the Greek fire, and leaving the ship, leaped naked into the
sea ; on which the king's galley-men slew some of them, and
took many alive ; for there were in this buss one thousand four
hundred pagans, whom Saladin had chosen from all the pagans,
for the purpose of sending them to the city of Acre. These
being thus conquered and slain, the king distributed all their
property among his galley-men.

On the following day, which was Saturday, in the week of
Pentecost, he arrived at the siege of Acre, and distributed
many of the pagans, whom he had taken in the ship, among

the king of France and the chief men of the expedition. But
when the pagans, who were in the city of Acre, heard that
the pagans in the buss had been most of them drowned, and
that the king 'of England, the mighty triumpher over them,
had come to the siege, having entertained great hopes of them,
they dreaded him exceedingly, and from day to day sought
opportunities for surrendering the city to him, on condition
that they might depart therefrom with safety to life and limb.
The king of France, however, who on the Saturday in Easter
week had come to the siege, had before the arrival of the king
of England erected a stone tower and prepared his stone engines
and covered ways, and other engines of war, and placed them
in suitable positions ; but he effected nothing with them, as
he was awaiting the arrival of the king of England, who imme-
diately upon his coming erected his own engines of war.

The Pisans and the Genevese at this period came to him and
made offer of their services ; on which he retained the Pisans
and declined the offer of the Genevese, because they had sworn
fealty to the king of France and the marquis Conrad; the
Pisans, however, did homage and fealty to the king of Eng-
land ; on which the king of England, by his charter, confirmed
their liberties and customs which they had previously enjoyed
in the land of Jerusalem. On the third day after the arrival
of the king of England, the king of France dismissed all the
servants whom he previously had for the purpose of keeping
guard over his engines of war, on which the king of England
took into his service those whom the king of France had dis-
missed ; the consequence of which was, that the pagans in the
city, finding that the engines of the king of France were left
without guards, burned them.

After this, both of the kings were attacked with a malady
known by the name of " Arnaldia," in which they were nearly
reduced to the point of death, and lost all their hair. How-
ever, by the mercy of God, it came to pass that they both re-
covered from this sickness, and became stronger and more
hearty than ever in the service of God. On king Guido making
complaint to them that the marquis Conrad had violently and
unjustly deprived him of the revenues and rights of his king-
dom, they placed the revenues arising from articles sold in
market and the revenues of the port of Acre in the hands of
the Templars and the Hospitallers, for them to collect and take



208 AXNALS OF EOGEE DE HOVEDEff. A.D. 1191.

rare of, until it had been determined which of them was of
right entitled thereto.

Geoffrey of Lusignan, the brother of king Guido, also ac-
cused the marquis Conrad of breach of faith, and perjury, and
treason, against the king, his brother, and against the army of
the Christians, and gave his pledge that he would make good
the accusation. Conrad, however, being conscience- stricken,
declined to take his trial, but made his way through the crowd,
and left the place, the people crying after him, and saying,
" He is a traitor who refuses to take his trial." However, no
person laid hands upon him, for fear lest there might chance
to be a tumult among the people. On this he went to Tyre,
and a dissension immediately ensued between the kings on ac-
count of them, the king of France, as far as he possibly could,
taking the part of Conrad, and the king of England that of
king Guido ; in consequence of which, quarrels and strifes often
arose between the kings. A considerable time after, the king
of France sent for Conrad and made him chief in his house-
hold and his confidential adviser, and in consequence of his
advice and counsel, the king of France did many things against
God and the salvation of his soul ; for he even received pre-
sents from Saladin, and became friendly with him.

The next thing was, that the king of France made demand
of half of the isle of Cyprus and of all the things that the
king of England had gained on his way to Acre ; as a counter-
poise to which, the king of England demanded of the king of
France one half of Flanders, one half of all the property of the
earl of Flanders, and of the other vassals of his who had died
at the siege of Acre, as also one half of Tyre, which Conrad
had presented to him. But the demands of both were frivo-
lous and invidious, for the agreement made between them was
only that they should halve between them all that they should
acquire in the land of Jerusalem. This same agreement they
now renewed in the presence of the leaders and the principal
men of the expedition, and confirmed the same by their charters
and oaths, appointing the Templars, and the Hospitallers, and
other prudent men in whom they placed confidence, to receive
and halve between them all they should take ; after which
they became reconciled.

In the meantime, Saladin, the leader of the armies of the
pagans, frequently sent to the king of France and the king oi'



A.D. 1191. THE CHRISTIANS ARE FOREWARNED AT ACRE. 209

England pears, Damascene plums, and abundance of other
fruits of his country, besides other little presents, that this way
at least he might render them disposed to make peace with
him. For he had often made them offers of peace and concord,
both in consequence of his apprehensions of the sons of Nou-
reddin, who had laid claim against, him to the whole of the
territories of their father which Saladin had seized and retained
in his possession, and had, with the aid of the lord Musse,
their uncle, lately entered the territory of Saladin, and taken
possession of it as far as the great river Euphrates ; as also
because he wished to rescue his people who were being be-
sieged in the city. However, he would not entirely come to
terms with the kings, for he wished to retain in his hands the
city of Jerusalem and the Crag of Montreal, while the kings
refused to make any agreement with him on those terms. In
consequence of this, the stone engines of the kings and of the
other chieftains, never ceased hurling stones against the walls
of the city and its fortifications, and the miners of the kings
did not cease day or night undermining the city walls.

In the month of June, on the Lord's Day, being the vigil
of the Nativity of Saint John the Baptist, and the twenty-
seventh day of the moon, at the ninth hour of the day, there
was an eclipse of the sun, which lasted three hours ; so much
so, that the sun was obscured, and darkness came over the
earth, and the stars appeared in the heavens ; when the eclipse
had passed, the sun was restored to its former brightness.

In the city of Acre there was a man, a worshipper of God,
though in secret from fear of the pagans, who frequently sent
letters to the armies of the Christians, written in Hebrew,
. Greek, and Latin, and by them signified to the Christians all
the circumstances and intentions of the pagans ; in consequence
of which, the Christians, being often forewarned, avoided
the stratagems of the pagans. However, it was a cause of
great vexation to the Christians that they did not know this
man, nor yet his name, though in all the letters that he sent
he declared that he was a Christian, and in his writings he
always commenced with, " In the name of the Father, and of
the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen." However, it is a
thing greatly to be wondered at, that, neither before the taking
of the city nor yet after it was taken, he thought fit to discover
himself to the Christians.

210 ANNALS OF ROGER DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1191.

In the same month of July, the Christians filled up a great
part of the fosse, that they might plant their ladders against
the walls. On the pagans seeing this, who were being besieged,
they offered to surrender to the kings their city, with their arms'
and provisions, on condition of safety to life and limb, and
leave to depart. However, the kings were not willing to take
it in this way, but demanded of them the Holy Cross, and the
whole of the land of Jerusalem, in the same state it was in
before the capture of king Guido. Saladin, however, would
not agree to these terms.

In the same month of June, Kichard de Camville, whom
the king of England had appointed one of his justiciaries in
the island of Cyprus, was taken ill, and, without asking leave,
came to the siege of Acre, where he died. After his decease,
the Griffons and the Armenians, who had not yet made peace
with the king, appointed a new emperor to rule over them, a
monk of the family of the emperor Isaac. But Robert de Turn-
ham, the only one of the king's justiciaries remaining in the isle
of Cyprus after the death of Richard de Camville, collected a
large army and engaged with the new emperor, and, defeating-
him and his people, took him prisoner, and hanged him on a
gibbet.

In the same month of June, Ralph Eitz-Godfrey, to whom
the king had given charge of the emperor of Cyprus, departed
this life, and was buried at Tripolis ; after whose death, the
king gave the emperor into the charge of the Hospitallers,
who took him to the castle of Margant, and there placed him
in confinement.

In the same month of June, the miners of the king of Eng-
land undermined the foundations of the walls of the city of
Acre, the pagans who were inside being in ignorance thereof ;
and, placing logs of wood beneath, they set them on fire ; on
which a great part of the walls fell down.

In the meantime, the stone engines of the king of Prance, the
Templars, and the Pisans, had made a great breach in the wall,
near a tower which is called Maledetta, and the people of the
king of Erance ran towards the breach, hoping, by force, to
effect an entrance into the city. However, the pagans met
them with a strong hand, and drove them back ; and, as the
way was steep and narrow, many of the people of the king of
Erance were there slain. The Idng of England, however, and
his men were keeping guard in the meantime over the outer

trenches, which lay* between the army of the Christians and
that of Saladin ; for an agreement had been made between the
kings that, whenever one of them should be making an assault
upon the city, the other should in the meantime keep strict
guard over the outer trenches, in order that the army of Saladin
might not be able to do any injury to those making the assault,
by attacking them in the rear. This arrangement was also
made between the kings, because in every affair in which the
said kings and their people had united, they were less success-
ful than they would have been if they had acted separately,
for the king of France and his men looked contemptuously on
the king of England and his people, while he and his people
did the same to the others.

In the month of July, on the third day of that month,
being the fourth day of the week, a great part of the walls
of the city of Acre fell down, near the tower before-men-
tioned: upon which, Alberic Clement, the marshal of the
king of Prance, ran with a large body of armed men towards
the wall, with the standard of the king of France, the mar-
quis Conrad running with the rest towards the wall ; on reaching
which, they planted their ladders for the purpose of scaling.
The said Alberic then mounted the wall: but the pagans,
throwing over him an iron hook, dragged him within the
walls, and slew him, and crushed forty more with stones : on
which, Conrad with his people retreated, as he and they were
unwilling to discharge either stones or arrows against the
enemy, and the pagans against him and his people ; besides
which, the pagans who had come for the purpose of defending
the walls, remained, in the same spot waving the banner of
Conrad himself, which he had given them as a sign of peace,
in the sight and to the admiration of all.

On the day after this, the chief men who were in the city,
namely, Mestoc and Karakois, came to the king of France and
the king of England, and offered them the city, and the arms,
and gold, and silver that belonged to themselves and all the
others who were in the city, in return for leave to depart with
safety to life and limb. However, the kings declined to accede
to these terms ; but required, as the price of their ransom, all
the territory that Saladin and the other pagans had taken from
the Christians since the time that Louis, king of the Franks,
was at Jerusalem, as well as the Holy Cross, and the Christians
whom thev kept in captivity.

p 2



212 AKNALS OF EOGEE DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1191.

To this Mestoc and Karakois made answer, "These exor-
bitant demands we cannot comply with, except with the assent
and will of our lord Saladin, and our other principal men.
But give us a truce of three days, and allow us to go to our
principal men, that we may confer with them on the nature of
your demands." Accordingly, giving hostages as a security
for their return, they went to Saladin, but, on informing him of
the demands of the Christians, could not prevail upon him to
give anything for their ransom ; and so, in confusion, they took
their departure and entered the city. On the following night,
at about midnight, Saladin made an assault upon the guards
of the outer trenches, with the intention that while the Chris-
tians were giving their attention to the defence of the trenches,
the pagans who were in the city might more easily escape
by flight. But the kings, forewarned of this by a message
from the man of God before-mentioned, who was in the city,
placed guards around the walls, so that there was no safe egress
for any of the pagans.

Upon this, a great alarm was raised throughout the army
of the Christians, who, on being aroused from their sleep,
quickly snatching up their arms, hastened to the trenches,
and, making an attack upon the pagans, slew multitudes of
them, and put the rest to flight. On the fifth day of the month
of July, being the sixth day of the week, a breach in the
walls was again set fire to, which had been made by the men
of the king of England ; and, on the following night, the
bastions fell, with a great part of the walls, leaving a wide gap.
On the day after this, the king of England and his army,
having armed, approached with the view of making an as-
sault on the city ; on which the pagans immediately made a
signal that they wished to make peace with them : whereupon,
laying aside their arms, the Christians returned to their camp,
and Mestoc, Karakois, Hessedin, and Ordich came out of the
city for the purpose of having an interview with the kings,
and offered them the city, with all the other articles above-
mentioned.

After the kings and they had conferred upon the matter for
a considerable time, leave was given them to go to Saladin and
return. Accordingly they went, and prevailed upon Saladin
to offer to the kings the city of Jerusalem, and the Holy Cross, and
all the cities and castles which he had taken after the capture
of king Guido, and to repair and place them in the same state

in which they then were ; on condition, however, that the said
kings should either go with him, or send with him six thousand
knights and twenty thousand foot soldiers, to defend his terri-
tories against the lord Musse and the sons of Noureddin, who
had conquered his uncle Thekedin in battle, and taken posses-
sion of all his territory, although they had permitted them to
depart uninjured. However, the kings declined to do this, and
the pagans before-named entered the city disconsolate and in
confusion; their friends, however, deserting Saladin, loaded
him with censures.

On the seventh day of the month of July, being the Lord's
day, the king of France and his army made an assault upon
the city, near the tower called Maledetta, at the same spot at
which they had previously so done, but lost forty men, and
were able to effect nothing whatever. On the eighth day of the
month of July, Saladin burned Caiaphas, and destroyed the
vineyards in its vicinity. On the following night, when many
of the knights and men-at-arms of the Christian army were
watching before the tower of Maledetta, a light from heaven
shone around them, in which appeared to them the blessed
Virgin Mary, the Mother of Christ ; on which, from fear, the
guards were exceedingly alarmed, and became as though dead
men. But the blessed Virgin benignantly comforted them,
saying, "Be not terrified, for the Lord has sent me hither for
your safety. As soon as the day shall have dawned, go and
tell your kings, in the name of Jesus Christ my Son and Lord,,
and in my name, to cease levelling the walls of this city, as, on
the fourth day from this, the Lord shall deliver it into their
hands." At the same hour also at which the Mother of Christ
was speaking to the guards, a great earthquake took place in
the city, and so terrified the pagans, that they wished rather
to die than to live. In like manner shall the Lord, when He
shall come to judgment, appear gentle to the good, and terrible
to the wicked. After the Virgin Mary had thus spoken, she
was severed from before their eyes, and with her the light
departed which had shone around them.

Accordingly, in the morning the guards related to the kings
and the chief men of the army the vision which they had seen
and the words which the Mother of the Lord had spoken unto
them ; and immediately all the words which she had spoken
were spread throughout the army, and there was great rejoicing
among the people of God. Moreover, on the ninth and tenth



214 ANNALS OF EOGEK BE HOVEDEX. A.D. 1191.

days of July, Saladin caused all the vines and fruit-bearing
trees to be rooted up which were in the vicinity of Acre, and
all the cities and castles to be destroyed in which he felt no
confidence as being able to resist the attacks of the Christians.
On the eleventh day of the month of July, the Pisans , and
the array of the king of England made an assault on the city
of Acre, and, having mounted the walls, a Pisan, Leonardus
by name, was slain ; immediately after which the pagans made
a signal that they would surrender the city, and make peace
with the kings on their own terms. Accordingly, the chief
men of the pagans above-named came to confer with the kings
as to making peace, and, immediately after the conference,
returned to the city.

On the twelfth day of the month of July, being the sixth day
of the week, Philip, king of France, Richard, king of England,
and all the principal men of the Christians, assembled in the
morning at the tent, of the Templars, where they were met by
the principal men of the pagans besieged in the city; and, with
the sanction of the army of the Christians, the said kings made
peace with the pagans on the following terms The pagans were
to surrender to the said kings the city of Acre, with everything
therein, and to set at liberty five hundred Christian captives who
were there. They also covenanted with the kings that they
would deliver up to them the Holy Cross, and one thousand Chris-
tian captives, and two hundred Christian knights who were in
captivity, according as the said kings should make choice from
among all the captives who should be found in the possession of
Saladin ; and that they would give for the use of the kings two
hundred thousand besants. 25 They were also to remain as hos-
tages in the hands of the kings, upon the understanding that,
if they should not within forty days then next ensuing comply
with the terms above-mentioned, they should be at the mercy
of the kings for life and limb.

These covenants being made, and these terms being agreed
to by both sides, and confirmed by oath, the kings sent their
knights and men-at-arms into the city, and selected one hundred
of the richest and most noble of the pagans, and placed them in a
tower under a strong guard ; while the rest they caused to be
guarded in the houses and streets of the city, and supplied
them with necessaries, making it a rule that all who should
receive baptism and embrace the Christian faith should be set
at liberty. Being influenced, accordingly, by their apprehen-

sion of death, many of the pagans received baptism ; but, as
soon as they possibly could, they forsook the Christian religion
and betook themselves to Saladin ; on which the kings gave
orders that, from that time forward, no one should receive bap-
tism. On Saladin hearing of the peace which had been made
with the Christians, he pretended that it had not been made
with his sanction. On the thirteenth day of the month of July,
the king of France and the king of England divided between
themselves the city of Acre, and everything that was in it, both
the pagans as well as the gold and silver, and all other arti-
cles of property ; on which Drogo de Merlou and a hundred
knights were named on behalf of the king of France to receive
his share ; and Hugh de Gurnay and a hundred knights were
appointed on behalf of the king of England to receive his pro-
portion.

On the fourteenth day of the month of July, Saladin with-
drew himself and his army, and pitched his tents at a place
called Saphora, and messengers on his part went and returned
to the kings, with fruits and other presents; by whom Saladin
made offer to the kings of the whole of the land of Judea, with
the exception of the Crag of Montreal, which was beyond
the river Jordan, on condition, however, that they would lend
him two thousand knights and five thousand men-at-arms, for
one year, for the purpose of defending his territories against
the lord Musse and the sons of Noureddin. However, the
kings declined to accept these proposals on his part.

On the fifteenth day of the month of July, the kings ordered
their stone engines and other engines of war tf> be taken down.
On the sixteenth day of July, messengers came to the kings,
on behalf of the lord Musse and the sons of Noureddin, and
made the kings many and ample offers for the assistance of
their subjects against Saladin. On the same day, Alardus,
cardinal-bishop of Verona and legate of the Apostolic See, and
the archbishops of Tours, Pisa, and Aire, Hubert, bishop of
Salisbury, John, bishop of Evreux, Bernard, bishop of Bayonne,
the bishop of Tripolis, Philip of Chartres, and the bishop of
Beauvais, and other bishops of dioceses, consecrated the princi-
pal churches of the city of Acre, which the pagans had polluted,
and built altars to the Lord, and celebrated mass thereon. In
the meantime the kings and the people gave due attention to
the repair of the walls. On the seventeenth and eighteenth
days of the month of July, the Pisans, and money-dealers, 26 and

others who followed mercantile pursuits, received dwellings
within the city, in the open market, which the kings' servants
allotted to them, on the understanding that they were to pay,
yearly, the customary and proper rents for the same.

On the nineteenth day of the month of July, the earls and
barons, who had been now staying there nearly two years
besieging Acre, seeing that the kings had put every thing
that had been taken upon the surrender of the city into their
own purses, and were willing to give them no share there-
of, had a meeting beyond the outer trenches, and holding
a conference there, sent word to the kings that they would no
longer continue with them, unless they were sharers in the
gain as they had been in the labour ; on which the kings made
answer, that they would satisfy their wishes ; but as they
delayed so doing, many, being compelled by poverty so to do,
left them. On the twentieth day of the month of July, being
the feast of Saint Margaret the Virgin, Richard, king of Eng-
land, made a proposal to the king of Prance that they should
both make oath that they would remain with their armies
three years in the land of Jerusalem, for the purpose of sub-
jugating the land ; to which the king of France made answer,
that he would make no oath about the matter.

On the twenty-first day of the month of July, the king of
England first entered the city of Acre ; on which he and his wife
and sister took up their abode in the king's palace, while the
king of France was lodged in the mansion of the Templars.
On the twenty-second day of the month of July, being the
feast of Saint Mary Magdalene, the king of France sent to the
king of England Robert, bishop of Beauvais, Hugh, duke of
Burgundy, Drogo de Amiens, and William de Merlou, and
through them asked his sanction to his return to his own coun-
try ; on which the king of England made this answer to them :
" It will be a shame and a disgrace for my lord if he goes away
without having completed the business on which he came
hither. But still, if he finds himself ailing, or in bad health,
and is afraid lest he should die here, his will be done." On
the twenty-third day of the month, when it was spread
through the army that the king of France was about to de-
part, the principal men of his army came to him, and besought
him with tears not in this shameless manner to desert the ser-
vice of God. On the twenty-sixth day of the month of July,
by the advice of the king of France, Conrad came to the king

of England, and falling on the ground at his feet, asked his
forgiveness, on which the king of England put an end to all
his anger and displeasure against him On the following
day, also, the king of Prance came, and all the principal men
of the army, to hear the matters in dispute between king
Guido and the marquis Conrad. Accordingly, having taken
their seats, the marquis Conrad arose, and standing in the
midst of them, demanded the kingdom of Jerusalem in right of
his wife ; while Guido of Lusignan, who had been king be-
fore its capture, and escaped from it when it was taken, and
had commenced the siege of Acre, demanded restitution thereof
to be made to him, showing that he had done nothing for which
he deserved to lose his kingdom. After much bandying of words
on both sides, they each of them submitted themselves to the
award of the court of the kings, by whose advice and judg-
ment peace and final reconciliation were effected between them,
on the following terms :

In the first place, they both made oath, that is to say, king
Guido and the marquis Conrad, that they would abide by the
judgment of the kings, and faithfully observe the same. On
which, the said kings and the whole army adjudged to the
said king Guido, for his life, the kingdom of Jerusalem ; on
the understanding that if he should take a wife and have sons
or daughters, they should have no right to claim succession to
the kingdom as of hereditary right. But if the marquis Con-
rad and his wife, the sister of queen Sibylla, should happen
to survive him, they should succeed him in the kingdom, and
their heirs should in succession wield the sceptre and pos-
sess the same by hereditary right. And, in the meantime, all
the revenues of the kingdom were to be halved between them,
the royal dignity excepted, which was to belong to Guido
alone, so long as he should live. Conrad, also, was to have
Tyre, Sidon, and Baruth, and to hold the same by hereditary
right ; while he and his heirs were always to perform the due
and customary services for the same to the king of Jerusalem.
Geoffrey of Lusignan, also, the king's brother, was to have the
earldom of Joppa and Caesarea, and to hold the same by here-
ditary right ; and he and his heirs were always to perform the
due and customary services for the same to the king of Jerusalem.

On the twenty -ninth day of the month of July, Philip, king
of France, gave to Conrad, marquis of Montferrat, the moiety
of the city of Acre that belonged to himself, On the same



218 ANXALS OF ROGER DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1191.

day, the king of France again asked the king of England to
agree to his return home, but he could on no terms obtain his
sanction to his withdrawal, unless he should first swear upon
the Holy Evangelists that he would well and faithfully protect
the territories and subjects of the king of England until his
return, and would inflict no injury or grievance upon them, or
allow the same to be done by any one else. After this, the king
of France appointed the duke of Burgundy chief of his army,
giving up to him a great part of his treasure. Before his de-
parture, he also gave to Raymond, prince of Antioch, one hun-
dred knights and five hundred men-at-arms for the defence of
his territory against the pagans, and gave to each of the knights
forty marks of silver as his pay from the feast of Saint Michael
until Easter, appointing Robert de Quincy their governor and
captain. The king of England also, on the same day, gave to
the prince of Antioch five great ships, laden with horses, arms,
and provisions. On the thirtieth day of the month of July,
the king of France and the king of England divided among
themselves all the pagans who had been captured at Acre. On
the thirty-first day of the month of July, that is to say, on the
last day of that month, on the feast of Saint German, the king
of France departed from Acre, and, taking with him Reginald,
bishop of Chartres, and Peter, count de Nevers, went to Tyre ;
whither he also took Karakois and all the other pagans be-
longing to him, and made a stay there of two days.

On the third day of the month of August, the king of France
left Tyre, giving into the charge of the marquis Conrad all
his pagan prisoners. On the same day, the king of England
caused his ships to be laden, saying that he would go to Ascalon
to lay siege to it, and ordering all to follow him. On the fifth
day of the month of August, the king of England sent Hubert
Fitz-Walter, bishop of Salisbury, to Tyre, for the pagans
whom the king of France had taken thither, in order that he
might bring them back; but Conrad refused to let them go. On
his return, he related to the king the answer he had received from
Conrad, on which the king was enraged, and swore that he
would personally go to Tyre for the purpose of bringing them
away by force, unless Conrad should speedily let them go. On
this, the duke of Burgundy made answer to the king, saying :
" My lord, allow me to go, and I will bring them back ;" and
accordingly, he went and brought them back.

For the day that had been named was now approaching upon

which the pagans were to perform their stipulation, and to be
set at liberty. However, upon that day, the pagans neither
produced the Holy Cross, nor the Christian captives, nor yet the
money which they had promised for the safety of their life and
limbs : in consequence of which failure, all those pagans were
sentenced to undergo capital punishment. When this was told
to Saladin, he sent word to the king of England and the whole
army of the Christians, that if they cut off the heads of his
pagan subjects, he himself would strike oif the heads of all
the Christians whom he had in his power.

On the fourteenth day of the month of August, being the
fourth day of the week, on the vigil of the Assumption of
Saint Mary, the Mother of God and ever a virgin, the king of
England went beyond the outer trenches and pitched his tents
near the army of the pagans, and remained there some days,
having issued orders that all his army should attend him;
few, however, did so, in consequence of the deficiency of horses
and arms. On the same day, Saladin sent to the king of Eng-
land costly presents, and requested him to put off the day on
which he had proposed to cut off the heads of the pagans ; but
the king declined to put off the day any longer, or to accept
the presents of Saladin. On Saladin seeing and hearing this,
he caused the heads of all the Christians, whom he had in
his hands, to be cut off ; which was accordingly done on the
eighteenth day of the month of August, being the Lord's day.
On the same day, the king of England moved his army, and
drew near to the army of Saladin, and had an engagement
with him, on which occasion many fell on both sides both
killed and wounded, among whom, Peter Mignot, one of the
household of the king of England, was slain.

The king of England, although he heard of the death of the
Christians who had been slain, was still unwilling to anticipate
the time which he had fixed upon for taking off the heads of
the pagans. However, on the seventeenth day of the month
of August, being the third day of the week and the thirteenth
day before the calends of September, the kingjrf England
caused all the paganswho belonged to hirn^Jrom tFe "capture
of Acre to be led out before the army of Saladin, and their
heads to be struck off in the presence of all. The duke of
Burgun3y~arso caused the heads oFEe~ pagans to be cut off
who had belonged to the king of France, both within the city,

f without, and near the walls of the city.

Still, the king of England and the duke of Burgundy pre-
served some of the pagans for their ransom, whose names
were as follow : Mestoc, Karakois, Hessedin, the son of
Caulin, Hessedin Jordic, Passelari, Kamardoli, and Kaedin.
The number of the pagans thus slain was five thousand, all of
whom the Christians disembowelled, and found much gold and
silver in their entrails, while they preserved their gall for medi-
cal purposes. On the twenty-first day of the month of August,
after the slaughter of the pagans, the king of England delivered
into the charge of Bertram de Verdun the city of Acre, and the
queen of England, the queen of Sicily, and the daughter of
the emperor of Cyprus. On the twenty-second day of the
month of August, being the fifth day of the week, the king of
England crossed the river of Acre with his army, and, pitching
his tents between that river and the sea, on the sea-shore be-
tween Acre and Cayphas, remained there four days. After
this, he proceeded along the sea-shore towards Joppa, while
his ships sailed near him on the sea with his provisions and
engines of war, in order that if he had any necessity for so doing,
he might be enabled to return to his ships. Saladin and his army
in the meantime proceeded along the mountain passes, not far
from the king's army, that he might impede his passage.

In the month of September, on the third day after the ex-
altation of the Holy Cross, when the king of England and his
army had passed the straits of Merle, and the duke of Bur-
gundy with the Templars and Eranks was keeping the rear-
guard, and the king of England had hoisted his standard in
the midst of them, and had delivered his dragon 27 to Peter de
Pratelles to carry, against the claim of Robert Trussebut, who
had claimed to carry the same according to the right of his
predecessors, Saladin made a fierce attack upon the duke of
Burgundy and those who were with him. But no Christian
was slain on that occasion, with the sole exception of Jacques
de Avennes, who, with a few men withstood Saladin and his
army ; as the duke of Burgundy took to flight. On this, the
king of England, hearing the noise in the rear, wheeled about
and manfully engaged with the army of Saladin, and gained a
victory over him, slaying three thousand of the pagans ; after
which he remained there three days. The king then wrote to
his deputies and friends to the following effect ;

A.D. 1191. LETTEE OF RICHARD, KING OF ENGLAND. 221

The Letter of Richard, king of England, on the departure of the
king of France from Acre.

" Richard, by the grace of God, king of England, duke of
Normandy and Aquitaine, and earl of Anjou, to N., his dearly
beloved and faithful subject, greeting, Know, that after the
capture of Acre, and after the departure of my lord the king
of France from us at Acre, who there basely abandoned the
purpose of his pilgrimage, and broke his vow, against the
will of God, to the eternal disgrace of himself and of his
realm, we took the road to Joppa j and when we approached
near Assur, Saladin met us with a mighty host of his Sara-
cens, and made an attack upon us. However, by the mercy
of God, we lost not a man on this day, with the exception
of one of extreme valour, and much endeared to the whole
army by his merits, namely, Jacques de Avennes, who was
ever ready and devoted, like a stay and support to the army,
in all holiness and in the sincerity of the faith, for many years
past, to serve God in the army of the Christians. After this,
by the will of God, we arrived at Joppa. We fortified that
city with trenches and a wall, making it our purpose every-
where, to the very best of our power, to promote the interests
of Christianity. Also, on a second day, being the vigil of the
Nativity of Saint Mary, Saladin lost an infinite number of his
great men, and taking to flight, as though bereft of the benefit
of all aid and counsel, laid waste the whole of the land of
Sulia. Further, on the third day before the rout of Saladin, we
were wounded in the left side with a javelin, but by the grace
of God have now recovered from the effects thereof. Know,
also, that by the grace of God, we hope within twenty days
after the Nativity of our Lord, to recover the Holy City of
Jerusalem, and the Sepulchre of our Lord, after effecting
which we shall return home. Witness ourselves at Joppa, on
the first day of October."

same subject.

City of Jerusalem, the City of the living God, in favour of which
his name was invoked, the earth was alarmed and trembled,
because the King of heaven had lost His own land, the land
upon which His feet had stood. But the blessing of God being
diffused from the Apostolic See throughout the whole earth,
the friends of the Cross of Christ, as your holiness is not un-
aware, vying with each other, pressed onwards to -assume the
sign of the Cross on their foreheads and on their shoulders, and
to avenge the injuries done to that Holy Cross. Among these
and ourselves was divided the task undertaken by us of thus
serving the living God, on assuming the sign of the Cross for
the purpose of defending the scenes of His death which had
been made holy by His precious blood, and which the enemies
of the Cross of Christ had hitherto disgracefully profaned ; and
within a short time after the arrival of my lord the king of the
Franks at Acre, there, by the guidance of the Lord, did we
also arrive ; shortly after which the noble city of Acre was surren-
dered to my lord the king of the Franks and ourselves, the lives
being saved of the Saracons who had been sent for the purpose
of defending and protecting it, and an agreement being fully con-
firmed on the part of Saladin that he would give up to us the
Holy Cross, and one thousand five hundred captives alive, a day
being appointed for the due performance of the said covenants.
However, the time having expired, and the stipulation which
he had agreed to being utterly disregarded, we put to death
about two thousand six hundred of the Saracens whom we held
in our hands, as we were bound to do ; retaining, however, a
few of the more noble ones, in return for whom we trusted to
recover the Holy Cross and certain of the Christian captives.
After this, the king of the Franks having returned home, and
the ruins and breaches in the walls of the city of Acre being
duly repaired, and the city properly fortified with trenches and
a wall, we agreed that at Joppa we would promote the interests
of Christianity and pursue the object of our vow ; and, together
with ourselves, the duke of Burgundy with the French placed
under his command, the count Henry with his men, and many
other earls and barons, and an innumerable body of people,
determined to proceed. As between Acre and Joppa there
was a very considerable distance, and a very long road, we
at length, after much toil, and a severe loss of men, came down
to Ca3sarea. Saladin, also, on the same march lost a great num-
ber of his men. After the people of God had taken breath for a



A.D. 1191. LETTER OP PJCBLABD TO THE ABBAT OF CLAIEVAL. 223

time at that place, we pursued our intended route towards
Joppa. Our vanguard having gone before and pitched their
tents at Assur, Saladin with a mighty host of Saracens made
an attack upon our rear-guard; on which, by the favouring grace
of the Divine mercy, he was put to flight by only four battalions
who faced about against him, and for a whole league was
pursued in his flight by the entire troops of the Christians ;
in consequence of which, such a slaughter took place of the
more noble Saracens whom Saladin had with him, namely, in
the vicinity of Assur, on the vigil of the Nativity of Saint Mary
the Virgin, being Saturday, that Saladin had experienced none
like thereto on any one day in the preceding forty years. We,
however, by the grace of God, lost not one that day, with the ex-
ception of one very valiant man, Jacques de Avennes, and much
endeared to the whole army by his merits, who was ever ready
and devoted, like a stay and support to the army, in all holiness
and in the sincerity of the faith, for many years past, to serve God
in the army of the Christians. After this, by the guidance of
the Lord, we arrived at Joppa, and strengthened that city with
trenches and a wall, making it our purpose in every quarter to
promote the interests of Christianity to the utmost possible ex-
tent. Since the day of the discomfiture of Saladin above-men-
tioned, he has not dared to engage with the Christians, but, like
a lion in his den, has been secretly lying in ambush in the more
elevated places for the purpose of slaying the friends of the
Cross like sheep destined for slaughter. Accordingly, on hearing
that we were marching towards Ascalon with hasty steps, he
overthrew that place and levelled it with the ground, and has
now deserted and set at nought the whole land of Syria, as
though he had been utterly bereft of the benefit of all counsel
and assistance ; in consequence of which, we consider it to be a
ground for sanguine hopes, that in a short time, by the bounty
of God, the inheritance of the Lord will be entirely regained.
And as the inheritance of the Lord has already in some mea-
sure been regained, and we have in the recovery thereof en-
dured all the heat and burden of the day, and have now ex-
hausted all our money, and not only our money, but our strength
and body as well ; we do notify unto your brotherhood that we
are not able to remain in the country of Syria beyond the
festival of Easter. The duke of Burgundy, with the Franks
placed under his command, count Henry, with his men, and the
other earls, barons, and knights, who, in the service of God have



224 ANNALS OF ROGER DE HOVEDEJT. A.D. 1191.

expended their means in behalf of God, will return home, unless
through the skilful effects produced by your preaching, timely
provision shall be made for them, in men, by whom the land
may be peopled and defended, and in money, which they may
expend more freely in the service of God. Wherefore, falling
at the feet of your holiness and shedding tears, we do proffer our
humble entreaties, and do most earnestly beseech you that in
such manner as becomes your duty and your honor, you will
make it your endeavour to induce the princes and noblemen
throughout all Christendom, and the rest of the people of God,
to give their services to the living God, and to prompt them
so to do. And therefore, after the said festival of Easter, let
it be for them to defend and protect the kingdom of the Lord,
of which we, by the mercy of God, will, by the said time of
Easter, more fully gain possession. And be it the care of your
diligence to act with such earnestness in this respect, that no-
thing may through neglect on your part be lost, of that which
the common advantage of all Christendom so ardently awaits.
And for this reason it is that we do at this early period direct
to your holiness our letters with reference to the interests of
Christianity ; to the end that we may not be reproached
with slothfulness and negligence, in case we had in any way
neglected to forewarn a man of such position and of so holy
a life on the urgent interests of Christendom. Therefore, in
such manner as before we had resolved on this expedition,
you encouraged us and the rest of the people of God to enter
the service of God, and to restore His inheritance to Him, so
now as well does the most urgent necessity call upon you,
with all earnestness to arouse the people of God to act as here-
inbefore mentioned. Witness ourselves, at Joppa, on the first
day of October."

It is also to be observed that, immediately after the rout
of Saladin, the pagans who were in Ascalon and Joppa
abandoned those places, not daring to await the arrival of
the king of England ; accordingly, the king of England found
them both deserted, and fortified them with castles and trenches.
Shortly after this, the king of England having gone one day
to some gardens about a mile from Joppa, to walk there, he
fell asleep, on which a multitude of pagans surprised him,
and aroused the king from his slumbers ; immediately on which,
he mounted his horse, and manfully withstood the Saracens.
However, William de Pratelles, one of his household, was there



A.D. 1191. TREATY BETWEEN THE CHANCELLOR AND THE EARL. 225

taken prisoner, and Reginald, his comrade, was slain ; one also
of the king's chargers was taken there, and its leader slain,
and the king only escaped through his prowess. When the
king was mounting his horse, his belt, enriched with gold and
precious stones, fell off, which was found by William de Corne-
burg, and afterwards restored to the king. Saphadin, the
brother of Saladin, also sent back his' horse to the king, who
returned to Joppa. After this, the king fortified the castle of
Planes, and the castle of Maen, and stayed at Joppa till nearly
the Nativity of our Lord.

In the meantime, a serious dissension arose in England
between the king's chancellor and John, earl of Mortaigne,
the king's brother, relative to the castle of Lincoln, which the
chancellor besieged, having expelled Gerard de Camville from
the keepership and the office of sheriff of Lincoln ; which former
office the chancellor gave to William de Stuteville, and made
him sheriff as well. But while the said chancellor was be-
sieging the castle of Lincoln, the castle of Nottingham and
the castle of Tickhill, which belonged to the king, were sur-
rendered to earl John, who immediately sent word to the
chancellor that, unless he quickly gave up the siege, he would
visit him with a rod of iron.

Consequently, the chancellor, being alarmed at the com-
mands of John, earl of Mortaigne, broke up the siege ; and,
through the mediation of many of the bishops, and other
faithful servants of our lord the king, they appointed a day
for an interview, at which an agreement was made between
them on the following terms :

" Be it known to all men to whom this present writing shall
come, that the dispute that has arisen between the earl of
Mortaigne and our lord the chancellor has been, through the
mediation of the archbishop of Rouen, and the bishops of
Durham, London, Winchester, Bath, Rochester, and Coventry,
and other faithful servants of our lord the king, set at rest ;
inasmuch as the earl of Mortaigne has restored to our lord the
king, by the hands of the lord archbishop of Rouen, the
castles of Tickhill and of Nottingham, to be given into the
charge of William Marshal and of William de Wendenal ;
that is to say, the castle of Nottingham to William Marshal,
and the castle of Tickhill to William de Wendenal ; which
said castles they shall, having made oath thereto, keep to the
honor of and in fealty to our ]ord the king, until such time as

he shall return ; and when he shall return, then they shall do
therewith according to his will and command. And if, which
God forbid, it shall so happen that our lord the king shall
depart this life during the pilgrimage, then the said per-
sons shall, without detaining the same or any delay, deliver
up the before-mentioned castles to the said earl. And if it
shall so happen that, in the meantime, our lord the chan-
cellor shall be guilty of any excesses against the said earl,
and, on being requested to make amends for the same with
out delay, in conformity with the advice and opinion of the
said lord archbishop of Eouen and others of the household
of our lord the king and of his court, shall refuse so to do,
then they shall restore and give up the said castles to the
said earl. These other castles also, with the honors thereof
granted to him by our lord the king, have been delivered into
the charge of faithful servants of our lord the king ; that is
to say, the castle of Wallingford has been given up to the lord
archbishop of Eouen, the castle of Bristol to the lord bishop
of London, the castle of the Peak to the lord bishop of Coven-
try, the castle of Bolsover to Eichard of the Peak, and, if the
said Eichard should decline it, the lord bishop of Coventry is
to take it, the castle of Eye to Walter Eitz-Eobert, the castle of
Hereford to earl Eoger Bigot, the castles of Exeter and of Laun-
ceston to Eichard Eevel ; who have in like manner sworn that,
as they owe fealty to our lord the king, they will faithfully keep
the same for his service. And, further, three castles, which
belong to the crown of our lord the king, have been delivered
in trust as follows : the castle of Windsor to the earl 01
Arundei, the castle of Winchester to Gilbert de Lacy, and the
castle of Northampton to Simon de Pateshull, who have in
like manner sworn that, as they owe fealty to our lord the
king, they will faithfully keep the same for his service. It
has been further agreed, that bishops, abbats, earls, barons,
vavasors, and freeholders shall not, at the will of justices or
deputies of our lord the king, be disseised of their lands and
chattels, 28 but shall be dealt with by judgment of the court of
our lord the king, according to the lawful customs and assizes
of the realm, or according to the command of our lord the
king. And in like manner the lord John shall cause similar
provisions to be made in his lands. And, if any person
shall presume to do otherwise, at the prayer of the before-
23 " Caballis," in the text, is clearly a mistake for " catallis."

named earl, the same shall be rectified by the lord archbishop
of Rouen, if he shall be in England, and by the justices of our
lord the king, and by those who have thus sworn to keep the
peace; and, in like manner, at their prayer, the said John
shall cause due reparation to be made. All new castles built
after the departure beyond sea of our lord the king on his pil-
grimage, whether begun or whether finished, shall be razed,
and no other new ones shall be fortified until the return
of our lord the king, except in manors demesne of our lord
the king, if need there shall be, or in case such shall be
done in the service of some person named by the precept of
our lord the king, conveyed hither by letter or by some trusty
messenger. Gerard de Camville shall be reinstated in the
office of sheriff of Lincoln, and on the same day a proper day
shall be appointed for him to make his appearance in the court
of our lord the king, there to abide his trial ; and if in the
judgment of the court of our lord the king proof can be given
that he ought to lose that office as also the keepership of the
castle of Lincoln, then he is to lose the same ; but, if not, he
is to keep it, unless in the meantime an agreement can be come
to relative thereto on some other terms. And the lord John is
not to support him against the decision of our lord the king,
nor is he to harbour such outlaws, or enemies to our lord the
king, as shall be named to him, nor allow them to be harboured
on his lands. But if any person shall be accused of any offence
committed against our lord the king, it shall be lawful for
the earl to harbour him in his lands so long as he shall offer
to make due redress in the court of our lord the king. To main-
tain and observe this treaty of peace in good faith and without
evil intent, the said earl, and chancellor, and fourteen barons,
on the two sides, have made oath at the hand of the said lord
archbishop of Rouen ; namely, on the part of the chancellor,
the earl of Arundel, the earl of Salisbury, the earl Roger
Bigot, the earl of Clare, Walter Fitz-Robert, William de
Braove, and Roger Fitz-Remfray ; and, on the part of the earl,
Stephen Ridel, his chancellor, William de Wendenal, Robert
de la Mare, Philip de Lurcester, William de Kahannes, Gilbert
Basset, and William de M ontacute . And if within the time of the
truce anything shall have been taken or intercepted on either
side, it shall be lawfully returned and made good. And this
treaty has been made, saving in all things the authority and
commands of our lord the king ; but so that if, before his re-

turn, our lord the king shall be unwilling that this treaty shall
hold good, the before-named castles of Nottingham and Tick-
hill shall be restored to the lord John, whatever commands
our lord the king may give relative thereto."

In the same year, a short time after the above-mentioned
treaty of peace made between the chancellor and the earl,
Geoffrey, the archbishop elect of York was consecrated by
"William, archbishop of Tours, by command of Celestinus,
the Supreme Pontiff ; and, immediately after his consecration,
being unmindful of the oath which he had made to the king, his
brother, to the effect that he would not return to England till
after the expiration of three years from the time that the king
left England, he hastened to return to England. However, on
his arrival at Witsand, in Flanders, for the purpose of crossing
over to England, he was forbidden on part of the chancellor
to presume to return to England, contrary to the tenor of the
oath which he had taken before the king ; but the archbishop
refused at his command to abandon his purpose; wherefore,
the chancellor ordered him to be seized, if he should come into
England.

Accordingly, the archbishop of York came over to England,
and landed at Dover, in the month of September, while the
servants of the chancellor were standing on the shore for the
purpose of laying hands on him. Being, however, forewarned
of this, before he left the ship he changed his clothes, and
mounting a horse in whose speed he had confidence, fled to a
monastery of monks in that town. It was about the sixth
hour of the day, and the monks had begun mass, and the Epis-
tle was being read, in which they had just come to the passage
where the holy Apostle says : " He that troubleth you shall
bear his judgment, whosoever he be ;" 29 and again, in the same
Epistle, " I would they were even cut off which trouble you," 3
when the archbishop of York entered the church, putting his
trust in the Lord ; and he received the same as a pleasing
omen, referring it to the lasting quiet of his own holy office,
and the approaching confusion of the chancellor.

Upon this, the servants of the chancellor whom he had sent
to apprehend him, besieged the church on all sides, so that he
could not come forth without falling into their hands ; and one
day, after the celebration of the mass, while the said arch-
bishop, clad in his sacerdotal habiliments, was still standing
29 Gal. v. 10. 30 Gal. v. 12.

at the altar, these sinister satellites effected an entrance into
the church, and laid violent hands upon him, and dragged him
forth from the church. After dragging him out, or rather tear-
ing him away therefrom, they vilely and ignominiously led
him through the mud of the streets, and along the lanes, while
the people stood shouting after them : " cowards ! why do
you take him in this manner ? What harm has he done ? He
is an archhishop, the brother of a king, and the son of a king ! "

However, not attending to the words of the people, they took
him to Dover castle, and delivered him into the custody of
Matthew de Clare, the constable thereof. "When this was told
to earl John, the brother of the said archbishop, he enquired
of the chancellor if this had been done by his order, on which
he admitted that it was, and did not deny it ; whereupon the
earl gave orders that the archbishop should be set at liberty,
which was done accordingly.

On his arrival at London, he made complaint to earl John,
and the bishops, and other nobles of the kingdom, respecting
the injuries done to him and his people by the chancellor
and his men; and the earl gave orders that the chancellor
should take his trial in the king's court for the injury which he
had done to his brother the archbishop of York, and to Hugh,
bishop of Durham. On the chancellor delaying to do this from
day to day, the earl John, and the archbishop of Rouen, and the
bishops and principal men of the kingdom, named a peremp-
tory day for his appearance at Reading : on which day there
came thither the earl of Mortaigne, and nearly all the bishops,
earls, and barons of the kingdom ; but though they waited
there after the peremptory day, expecting the arrival of the chan-
cellor, he declined to come, or even to send a message. Upon
this, earl John, and the bishops who were with him, prepared
to set out for London, that being there met by a more consider-
able number of persons, they might enjoy the benefit of the
advice of the citizens of London, what to do as to their chan-
cellor, who had created this confusion in the kingdom, and re-
fused to take his trial.

On the chancellor hearing this, he left "Windsor and has-
tened to London, and, while on the road, it so happened that
his household and knights met the knights of earl John, on
which a sharp engagement took place between them. In this
affair one of the knights of earl John, by name Roger de Planis,
lost his life ; however, the earl prevailed, and the chancellor and

his men taking to flight, he entered London, and took refuge
with his people in the Tower of London. Earl John, and nearly
all the bishops and earls of England, also entered London on
the same day, namely, the third day after the octave of Saint
Michael, and, on the following day, the said earl John, the
king's brother, and the archbishop of Rouen, and all the bishops,
and the earls, and barons, met the citizens of London in Saint
Paul's Churchyard, and there made accusation against the said
chancellor of many offences, and especially the injuries he had
done to the lord archbishop of York and the lord bishop of
Durham.

The associates also of the said chancellor whom the king had
associated with him in the government of the kingdom, ac-
cused him of many offences, saying that, despising their advice,
he had transacted all the affairs of the kingdom according to im-
pulse and his own will. The archbishop of Rouen also, and
"William Marshal, earl of Striguil, then for the first time pro-
duced before the people the sealed letters from our lord the king,
in which the king had sent orders from Messina that they should
be associated with him in the government of the kingdom, and
that, without the advice of them and the other persons so ap-
pointed, he was not to act in the affairs of the king and the
kingdom, and that if he should do anything to the detriment
of the kingdom, or without the consent of the persons before-
named, he should be deposed, and the archbishop of Rouen
substituted in his place.

It seemed good therefore to John, the king's brother, and all
the bishops, earls, and barons of the kingdom, and to the
citizens of London, that the chancellor should be deposed, and
they accordingly deposed him, and substituted in his place the
archbishop of Rouen, who was willing to do nothing in the
government of the kingdom except with the will and consent
of the persons assigned to him as associates therein, and with
the sanction of the barons of the exchequer. On the same
day, also, the earl of Mortaigne, the archbishop of Rouen, and
the other justiciaries of the king, granted to the citizens of
London the privilege of their commonalty ; and, during the same
year, the earl of Mortaigne, the archbishop of Rouen, and the
other justiciaries of the king, made oath that they would so-
lemnly and inviolably observe the said privilege, so long as the
same should please their lord the king. The citizens of Lon-
don also made oath that they would faithfully serve their lord

king Richard, and his heirs, and would, if he should die with-
out issue, receive earl John, the brother of king Richard, as
their king and lord. They also swore fealty to him against
all men, saving always their fealty to king Richard, his brother.
Upon this, the chancellor, being deposed, made oath that he
would surrender all the castles throughout England, and im-
mediately surrendered to him the Tower of London ; and he
delivered it to the archbishop of Rouen, as also Windsor, and
some other castles, but not all of them.

On this occasion, Hugh de Nunant, the bishop of Coventry,
wrote to the following effect :

The Letter of Hugh, bishop of Coventry, on the deposition of
William, bishop of Ely, the king's chancellor,

" The things that are committed to writing are beyond
doubt bequeathed to posterity, to the end that the page that is
confirmed by the testimony of a few, may either advise for the
safety, or redound to the benefit of, many: and may what
is here set down be considered as an illustration of the truth of
the same. For many things are committed to writing by way
of caution, that the same may be done ; and many, again, that
they may not be done ; that so the church of Christ may profit
on either side, and may both seek what is to be coveted and shun
what is to be avoided. For this reason it is our wish that the
fall of the bishop of Ely should, by letters attesting the same,
be brought to the notice of all ; to the end that in this illustra-
tion humility may always find that by which to profit, and
pride that which to hold in dread. For he was a great man
among all the people of the west, and, as though gifted with
a twofold right hand, wielded the power of the kingdom and
the authority of the Apostolic See, and was in possession of
the king's seal over all lands, so as to be enabled to govern ac-
cording to his own will, and of his own power to bring all
things to completion ; even in the same degree of estimation as
both king and priest together was he held : nor was there any
person to be found to dare to offer resistance to his will. For
he said, and the thing was done, he commanded, and all means
were discovered. In his hands were the royal treasures, the
whole of the king's riches, and the entire exchequer, so much
so that all property whatsoever that swam beneath our skies
was no longer said to belong to the king, but to him. For

there was neither that which is hunted for on land, fished for
in the water, or flying in the air, which was not compelled to
be at the service of his table, insomuch that he appeared to
have shared the elements with the Lord ; leaving the heaven of
heavens alone to the Lord, and reserving the other three to
advantage by the use or rather abuse and luxurious enjoy-
ment thereof. All the sons of the nobles acted as his servants,
with downcast looks, nor dared they to look upwards towards
the heavens, unless it so happened that they were addressed by
him ; and if they attended to anything else, they were pricked
with a goad, which their lord held in his hands, fully mindful
of his grandfather of pious memory, who being of servile condi-
tion in the district of Beauvais, had for his occupation to guide
the plough and whip up the oxen; 31 and who at length, to
gain his liberty, fled to the Norman territory. The grand-
children and relatives of this man, even any females whatsoever
who were akin to him, though sprung from a poor cabin, earls, ,
and barons, and nobles of the kingdom, longed with the greatest
avidity to unite with themselves in marriage ; thinking it a
matter for pride, under any title whatever, to acquire the fa-
vour of his intimate acquaintanceship ; nor was there a churl
who longed for a field, a citizen who longed for a farm, a
knight who longed for an estate, a clerk who longed for a
benefice, or a monk who longed for an abbey, who was not
obliged to become subservient to his power and influence. And
although all England, bending the knee, was ever at his ser-
vice, still did he always aspire to the free mode of life of the
Franks, and removed his knights and yeomen, and all his house-
hold, to Oxford ; where, slighting the English nation on all oc-
casions, attended by a troop of Pranks and Flemings, he moved
pompously along, bearing a sneer in his nostrils, a grin on his fea-
tures, derision in his eyes, and superciliousness on his brow, by
way of fit ornament for a priest. For his own aggrandizement
and for the glorification of his name, he was in the habit of getting
up verses that he had picked up by begging, and adulatory jin-
gles, and enticed jesters and singers from the kingdom of France
by his presents, that they might sing about him in the streets ;
and but lately it was everywhere said that there was not such a
person in all the world. And really, if it had been the time
of the Cassars, he would with Liberius 33 have had himself styled

the living God. But when the king had given him certain
earls as his associates, in order that at least the more weighty
concerns of the realm might be managed by their counsels in
common, he could not at all endure to have any partner
therein, as he thought that the greater part of his glory would
be thrown into the shade, if he should stand in need of the
advice of any mortal being. Therefore he ruled alone, there-
fore he reigned alone, and from sea to sea was he dreaded as
though a God ; and were I to say still more, I should not be
telling a falsehood, because God is long-suffering and merciful ;
while he, ruling every thing according to his own impulses,
was neither able to observe justice when acting, nor to endure
delay in waiting the proper time. Hence it arose that he set
at nought all the letters and mandates of his lord ; that he might
not seem to have a superior, nor be supposed to be subject to
any one, having always made every one act as the servant of
his own will. Therefore, after England had for a considerable
time suffered under so heavy a burden and a yoke so insup-
portable, at length, while groaning at his deeds, she cried
aloud with all her might. Her cries went up to the Lord,
and He, rising, looked down on her from on high, who by
His own might treads under foot the necks of the proud and
haughty, and exalts the humble by the might of His arm.
The sun of justice, indeed, may shine upon the good and
the bad, still the eyes of the overwise it dazzles, and by
the brilliancy of its light brings forth fruit in the minds of the
humble. For although this chancellor may perchance have
read that it is denied us long to dwell on high, 34 and that ' He
who stands must take care lest he fall,' 35 and that, ' He who
exalteth himself shall be abased,' 36 and that before a downfall
the heart is elated ; still, being forgetful of the lot of mankind,
which never remains in the same condition, and of the volubility
of the wheel that elevates the lowly man, and, when elevated,
is wont to depress him, he was never willing to understand that
he ought to act virtuously ; but meditating iniquity in his bed,
where he was sleeping with the ministers of wickedness, and
with youths in his chamber, he added iniquity to iniquity, so
as by his pride and his abuses, through the just retribution of
God, to precipitate himself into the powerful hands of the Lord ;
so that now there was no longer any room for mercy for him, but

34 Perhaps alluding to Is. xxvi. 5. 35 Alluding to 1 Cor. x. 12.

234 A2TCTALS OF ROGER DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1191.

solely for the exercise of power. Nor indeed was there an op-
portunity for taking compassion on him or sparing him. For
it was he himself who dictated the sentence against himself,
who goaded vengeance on, who aimed at crimes so great, that
he thereby provoked the anger not only of men, but still more,
of God. For although the Lord can do all things, still He is
unable to condemn a man who is innocent, or to save one who
is guilty, nor would He spare him if the guilty man should
chance to be obstinate in his guilt. For against an obstinate
mind and the forehead of a harlot may be brought the hard-
ness of real adamant, so as to be worn away thereby ; for
nothing is there so strong but that it must give way before
what is stronger. As, therefore, a man so powerful could not
be overcome by man, the Father of mercies and the God of all
consolation came to the aid of the people who supplicated
God, and supplanting the hand of mercy in his case, hurled
him down from his power, and brought this accuser, or rather
destroyer, to such a pitch of giddiness of mind, that he was
unable to recover or arouse himself therefrom ; but He so hard-
ened his heart, blinded his mind, and infatuated his counsels,
that he first besieged the archbishop of York in a church, then
seized him, and after seizing him, violently tore him away ; after
tearing him away, strongly bound him ; after strongly binding
him, dragged him along ; and after dragging him along, threw
him into prison. And although there was a concourse of
people who exclaimed, 'What has this righteous man and
friend of God been guilty of, that he should be taken to prison ?
his innocent blood is condemned without a cause,' still, pity
could not listen where pride reigned, and God was not heard
where the tyrant held sway. For the said archbishop was com-
ing from the country of Normandy with his pastoral staff and
mitre, and ring, and superhumeral, which in later times has
been styled the pall. And although he was the son of king
Henry, of happy memory, and the brother of king Richard,
who now reigns, and the brother of John, earl of Mortaigne,
still, his royal blood could be of no service to him ; and al-
though he had been recently consecrated, the recent perform-
ance of that sacrament could not avail him. Consequently, it
was in public the universal cry of the laity throughout the
whole island, ' Perish he who hastens on the ruin of all things !
that he may not crush all, let him be crushed. If he has



A.D. 1191. LETTER OF THE BISHOP OF COVENTBY. 235

done this in a green tree, what will he do in a dry one?" 37
And behold ! under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, all persons
meet together from the north^ and from the sea, and from all
parts of the whole island, and flock in crowds, that the arch-
bishop may be set at liberty. But the cords of his sins tight-
ening apace around the chancellor, and his conscience strongly
accusing him, clad in a coat of mail, he flies from before the faces
o/ men, and hides himself, and shuts himself with his people in
the Tower of London. As we entered the city at a late hour,
many of his household in arms attacked us with drawn swords,
and slew one of our knights, a noble man, and wounded a
great number. However, in the morning a council was held
by nearly all the nobles of the kingdom, in presence of the
lord John, the king's brother, the archbishops of Rouen and
York, and the bishops of Durham, London, Winchester, Bath,
Rochester, Norwich, Lincoln, Hereford, Saint David's, and
Coventry ; and in the presence of all the people of the city,
and of the justiciaries of our lord the king, who approved
thereof, we did, with the assent of all, agree that such a person
should thenceforth no longer rule in the kingdom of England,
by whom the Church of England was reduced to a state of igno-
miny, and the people to want ; for, to omit other matters, he
and his revellers had so exhausted the whole kingdom, that
they did not leave a man his belt, a woman her necklace, a
nobleman his ring, or anything of value even to a Jew.
He had likewise so utterly emptied the king's treasury, that in
all the coffers and bags therein, nothing but the keys could
be met with, after the lapse of these last two years. On the
third day he positively promised, and gave his word by one of
his followers, in the presence of all, that he would not leave
the island until certain castles which he kept in his own hands,
and had given into the charge of some foreigners, unknown
and obscure persons, and which were then named, should have
been fully surrendered by him and given into the charge of
certain persons named ; for the performance of which he gave
his brothers and his chamberlain as hostages. He then
hastened to Canterbury, that there, as became him, he might
assume the cross of pilgrimage, and lay aside the cross of the
legateship, which for a year and a half since the death of pope
Clement, he had wielded to the prejudice of the Church of
Rome, and to the detriment of that of England. For all the
37 St. Luke xxiii. 31.

churches of England had that cross put to their ransom ; that
is to say, had compelled them to submit to the extortion of
fines ; nor was there any one exempt from feeling the blows
of that cross. And then, besides if by chance it happened that
he entered the house of any bishop, you will be able to learn
from him that his entertainment cost him the price of one or
two hundred marks. After he had remained in the castle of
Dover some days, unmindful of his profession and of the obli-
gation of his promise which he had given, forgetful also of his
brothers, whom, having given as hostages, he was disgracefully
exposing to peril of death, he determined to set sail, and as he
did not care to do this openly, he hit upon a new kind of stra-
tagem, and pretending to be a woman, a sex which he always
hated, changed the priest's robe into the harlot's dress. Oh
shame ! the man became a woman, the chancellor a chancel-
loress, the priest a harlot, the bishop a buffoon. Accordingly,
although he was lame, he chose to hasten on foot from the
heights of the castle down to the sea-shore, clothed in a wo-
man's green gown of enormous length instead of the priest's
gown of azure colour ; 38 having on a cape of the same colour,
with unsightly long sleeves, instead of a chasuble, a hood on
his head instead of a mitre, some brown cloth in his left hand,
as if for sale, instead of a maniple, 39 and the staff of the huckster
in his right in place of his pastoral staff. Decked out in such
guise the bishop came down to the sea-shore, and he who had
been accustomed much more frequently to wear the knight's
coat of mail, wondrous thing ! became so effeminate in mind,
as to make choice of a feminine dress. 40 Having seated himself
on the shore upon a rock, a fisherman, who immediately took
him for a common woman, came up to him ; and, having come
nearly naked from the sea, perhaps wishing to be made warm,
he ran up to this wretch, and embracing his neck with
the left arm, with his right began pulling him about, upon
which he almost immediately discovered 41 that he was a

a mistake for " amictum." 41 This passage has been necessarily

modified in the Translation ; it stands thus in the text " Cucurrit ad

man. At this lie was greatly surprised, and, starting back,
iit a fit of amazement, shouted out with a loud voice, ' Come
all of you and see a wonder ; I have found a woman who
is a man ! ' Immediately on this, his servants and acquaint-
ances who were standing at a distance came up, and with
a gentle kind of violence pushed him back and ordered him
to hold his tongue ; upon which the fisherman held his peace
and the clamour ceased, and this hermaphrodite sat waiting
there. In the meantime a woman, who had come from the
town, seeing the linen cloth, which, he or rather she, was
carrying as though on sale, came and began to ask what was
the price, and for how much he would let her have an ell.
He, however, made no answer, as he was utterly unacquainted
with the English language ; on which she pressed the more ;
and shortly after another woman came up, who urgently
made the same enquiry, and pressed him very hard to let her
know the price at which he would sell it. As he answered
nothing at all, but rather laughed in his sleeve, they began to
talk among themselves, and to enquire what could be the mean-
ing of it. Then, suspecting some imposture, they laid hands
upon the hood with which his face was covered, and pulling it
backward from his nose, beheld the swarthy features of a
man, lately shaved, on which they began to be extremely as-
tonished. Then rushing to the dry land, 42 they lifted their
voices to the stars, crying out, ' Come, let us stone this monster,
who is a disgrace to either sex.' Immediately a crowd of
men and women were collected together, tearing the hood from
off his head, and ignominiously dragging him prostrate on the
ground by his sleeves and cape along the sand and over the.
rocks, not without doing him considerable injury. In the
meanwhile his servants made an attack two or three times on
the multitude for the purpose of rescuing him, but were not
able, as all the populace were inflicting vengeance upon him
with insatiate eagerness, reviling him, inflicting blows and spit-
ting upon him ; and after much other disgraceful treatment,
they dragged him through the whole of the town, and then,
dragging him, or rather dragging him to pieces, they shut him
up in a dark cellar with a guard over him, for a prison. Thus

cumstances by all the chroniclers, and no doubt the bishop of Coventry
was wishful that it should lose nothing in his way of telling it. The first
part of this extract is exceedingly improbable.

was he dragged who had dragged another, made captive who
had been the captor, bound who had been the binder, incarce-
rated who had been the one to incarcerate, that so with the ex-
tent of the offence the extent of the punishment might seem to
be commensurate. For he became an object of extreme disgrace
to his neighbours, of dread to his acquaintances, and was made
a laughing-stock for all the people. I only wish that he had
polluted himself alone, the priest, and not the priestly office.
May, then, the Church of Eome make due provision that such
great guiltiness may be punished in such a way, that the
offence of one may not contaminate all, and that the priestly
authority may not be lessened thereby. And further, may the
king of England take all precaution to appoint such a person
over his realm, that by him the royal dignity may be preserved,
and his authority may suffer no diminution through him ; but
rather that the clergy and the people may have cause to congra-
tulate themselves upon his government."

The Letter of Master Peter of Blois on behalf of William, bishop
ofEly*

" To his former lord and friend, Hugh, so called, bishop of
Coventry and Chester, Peter of Blois, archdeacon of Bath, may
he remember God with fear. The excesses of a traitorous
faction this day reveal to what lengths malice may proceed,
what envy may be guilty of. The bishop of Ely, one beloved
by God and men, a man amiable, wise, generous, kind, and
meek, bounteous and liberal to the highest degree, had by the
dispensations of the Divine favour, and in accordance with the
requirements of his own manners and merits, been honored
with the administration of the state, and had thus gained the
supreme authority. With feelings of anger you beheld this, and
forthwith he became the object of your envy. Accordingly, your
envy conceived vexation and brought forth iniquity ; whereas
he, walking in the simplicity of his mind, received you into the
hallowed precincts of his acquaintanceship, and with singleness
of heart, and into the bonds of friendship and strict alliance.
His entire spirit reposed upon you, and all your thoughts unto
him were for evil. ' Woe/ says Ecclesiasticus, < to a double

this letter, " Peter of Blois took Hugh to account for this satire,which was

heart and to wicked lips, and to the sinner that goeth two
ways.' 44 The face of the hypocrite veiled the wickedness of
the conscience within with a kind of pretence of friendship,
and in secret you were inflicting upon an innocent man the
injuries caused by a seditious and petulant tongue. Solo-
mon says, ' Curse the whisperer and double-tongued : for such
have destroyed many that were at peace.' 45 All his in-
ward thoughts did he pour forth into your bosom : you he
looked upon as a second self, and yet you, to find a pretence for
causing his fall, thought fit to ply him with the adulation of a
betrayer. Oh detestable treachery ! Judas betrayed with a kiss,
you with words ; without, you made a show of the regard of an
attentive Mend, and your tongue was planning treachery. As
you sat, you spoke against your brother, and in the way of the
son of your mother did you lay a stumbling-block. ' Woe to
that man by whom the offence cometh.' 46 This guilty conduct,
indeed, has branded you with the lasting stain of bad opinion,
and if by the bounty of nature you had received any commend-
able points, this fault has done away with them for ever. In
like manner, Joab acted valiantly on many occasions, but his
treachery to Amasa and Abner, blackened in him all the glories
of his valorous deeds. Oh lips of detraction ! Oh tongue of abuse
and treachery ! What, Lord shall be applied to this treacherous
tongue ? Would that arrows might be applied thereto, that they
might pierce it through and through, and that desolating coals
of fire might consume it; would that thou, Seraph, who with the
live coal from heaven 47 didst purge the lips of the prophet,
wouldst with the flames of hell, in purging his whole face and
tongue, destroy the same, that so we might be able to sing and
say, ' In cleansing him thou hast destroyed him.' Lips conse-
crated by the Gospel, are never ceasing to babble forth their lying
words to the winds. That is entirely devoted to vanity which
was due and owing to truth. But the man of froward tongue
will not be guided on the earth ; wherefore, 'let him that stand-
eth take care lest he fall,' for before ruin the heart is exalted.
Do you exult, unhappy man, and make it your boast that you
have supplanted an innocent man ? But know beyond a doubt,
that he has been thus laid low for both the downfall and the
uprising of many, for the uprising of himself and of his people,

and for the downfall of yourself and your accomplices. This
punishment will fall upon your own head. 47 For every deceit
suffers from its own recoil : from your treachery 48 nought but
the fruit of sorrow will you gather; and you have commenced the
web, that you may be wrapped in a double cloak. It is Isaiah
who says, ' Ye who begin the web and put your trust in the
darkness of Egypt, await the day of bitterness.' 49 You pub-
licly make it your boast and vaunt that it was you who created
this tumult, that it was you who deceived him when not on
his guard, and that it was you induced the multitude to attack
with arms an unarmed man, and an innocent man with insidi-
ousness. "Why boast of your malice, you, who are so powerful
in your iniquity ? Why vaunt of your malice, which in most
countries, as your infamous character has become circulated, is
in the mouths of all classes ? But about you and persons like
you it may justly be said, ' They rejoice when they have done
evil, and they exult at things that bring the greatest disgrace.'
Besides, it is the remark of the wise man, that he ' who rejoiceth
at the ruin of another, shall be punished ;' 50 and Solomon says,
* Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth lest the Lord see it,
and He turn his wrath upon thee.' 51 Indeed, it was always
the usual accomplishment, and one peculiar to your family, to
sow the materials for dissension ; and the pestilent branch has
contracted its evil qualities from the root of the noxious tree.
Oh evil generation ! Oh provoking race ! ' Oh generation of
vipers, who hath taught you to nee from the wrath to come?' 52
Do you think that God will not behold this, and require an
account thereof? It was for this same reason that the wicked
man caused the anger of the Lord, ' For he said in his heart,
he will not require the same.' 53 But, beyond a doubt, the Lord
will require it ; He will also require to know as to whose mis-
fortunes you are now boasting ; and at a future day, by the
bounty of the Lord, he shall breathe again. For wisdom will
not forsake the righteous man when sold, and in time shall he
gain respect. It rather befitted the gravity of your rank to
promote peace among the people, to allay sedition, and espe-

cially in England, which, receiving you poor enough, amplified
you with mighty honors. Also, when speaking to those who
were in the Babylonish captivity, he says : ' Seek the peace of
the city, in which the Lord hath caused you to be carried away
captives, for in the peace thereof shall ye have peace.' 54 On
another occasion I wrote to you, and with salutary warning
entreated you to abstain from such courses. However, the
harp of David never fully allayed the madness of Saul ; and
your hand has been extended to the commission of such deeds
as these. Therefore, remember, man, if only man you are, re-
member, I say, your condition ; remember the shortness of
this life ; remember the strict and dreadful judge ; remember
the punishment so fearful, so terrible, so interminable, and so
intolerable, which is reserved for you to everlasting, if you
desist not from such a course of wickedness."

In eight days after this, John, earl of Mortaigne, gave orders
that the chancellor should be liberated from prison, and should
take his departure. Accordingly, he took his departure, and,
crossing the sea, landed at Witsand, in Elanders. But while
he was on his road, some nobles of that country, whom he had
injured while in England, laid hands upon him, and kept him
till he had made satisfaction to them. Proceeding thence, he
arrived at Paris, and gave to Mauricius, the bishop, sixty marks
of silver, upon condition that he should be received there with
a procession, which was accordingly done. After this, he
returned into Normandy ; but, by the command of the arch-
bishop of Rouen, he was considered there as an excommuni-
cated person, and in every place to which he came, throughout
the whole of the archbishopric of Rouen, an end was put to
Divine service as long as he was staying there.

On this, he sent messengers to pope Celestinus, and to his
lord the king of England, informing them, how John, earl of
Mortaigne, and his accomplices, had expelled him from the king-
dom; and, complaining of the injuries done him, he demanded
restitution of what had been taken from him, at the same time
making offer, on his part, to obey the law, and further stating,
that if his acts and expenditure should not prove satisfactory
to his lord the king, he would in all things give satisfaction
according to his demands. Upon this, the Supreme Pontiff was
provoked to anger, and wrote, to the following effect, to all
the archbishops and bishops of England :

The Letter of pope Celestinus to the prelates of England, in
behalf of William, bishop of Ely.

" Celestinus the bishop, servant of the servants of God, to
his venerable brethren the archbishops and bishops throughout
the kingdom of England appointed, health, and the Apostolic
benediction. Whereas our dearly beloved son in Christ,
Richard, the illustrious king of the English, having assumed
the cross, and prepared himself for avenging the injuries done
to the Redeemer, has therein, like a prudent man and one who
seeks the Lord, considered that the cares of governing his
kingdom ought to be postponed to the performance of his duty,
and has left the same under the Apostolic protection : it is,
therefore, our wish and our duty, with the greatest zeal, to
preserve the integrity and the rights of his realm, and the
honor of himself, in the same degree that, trusting in our pro-
tection, he has exposed his person and his property to the
greatest danger for the upholding of the holy religion, and is
known, in obedience to the Creator, to have behaved himself
in a praiseworthy manner, the Lord dealing with him and
giving good tokens of success, and most zealously, as is mani-
fest from his exploits. Therefore, inasmuch as we have heard
that certain attempts have been made upon his kingdom itself,
as well as against your venerable father, William, bishop of Ely,
the legate of the Apostolic See, to whom he has committed the
government of his kingdom, both by John, earl of Mortaigne,
and certain other persons, which in themselves contain some
grounds of suspicion, and, if they are true, are known to re-
dound in no slight degree to contempt of the Apostolic See,
we have deemed it our duty at this early period to meet
such presumption, inasmuch as from delay very great injury
might possibly accrue to the king before - named and the
land of Jerusalem, and to ourselves and the Roman Church.
Wherefore, by these Apostolic writings, we do command the
whole of you, and in virtue of your obedience enjoin you, that
if (as has been reported to us) the said earl or any one else has
dared to lay violent hands on the bishop before-mentioned, or
to seize him, or to extort from him any oath by means of vio-
lence, or to keep him in confinement, or in any way to change
the state of the kingdom from the position in which it was
placed by his serene highness at his departure, in such case,
all pretexts and excuses laid aside, you will meet together,



A.D. 1191. LETTEE OF WILLIAX, BISHOP OP ELY.' 243

and, with candles lighted and bells ringing, all appeals and
excuses, and all respect for persons on your part utterly laid
aside, publicly announce as under the ban of excommunication
the said earl, and all his counsellors, advisers, accomplices, and
abettors in the said acts of presumptuous daring. You are
also to cause them, when thus excommunicated, to be strictly
avoided by all, both in their own lands as also in others which
they may have invaded, and you are entirely to forbid the cele-
bration there of divine service, except penance and the baptism
of children, all obstacle thereto by appeal being entirely re-
moved ; until such time as, the said legate having been released
from confinement as well as from the stringency of his oath,
and the kingdom having been replaced in the same position in
which it was left by the said king at his departure, envoys
shall come to the Apostolic See, with the testimony of letters
from him and from yourselves as well, for the purpose of ab-
solution. And know for certain that if, in the execution of
this our precept, you shall be negligent or remiss, we have
resolved, with the help of God, to inflict upon you no less a
punishment than if the said injury had been done to our own
person, or to one of our brethren. Given at the Lateran, on the
fourth day before the nones of December, in the first year of
our Pontificate."

Upon the authority, therefore, of these letters of the Supreme
Pontiff, the said bishop of Ely wrote to Hugh, bishop of Lin-
coln, to the following effect :

" William, by the grace of God, bishop of Ely, legate of
the Apostolic See, and chancellor of our lord the king, to his
venerable brother and most dearly beloved friend, [Hugh], by
the same grace, bishop of Lincoln, health, and sincere love
and affection. The more full the confidence that we feel in
your affection, the greater the constancy we have found in
you, so much the more confidently do we entrust to your dis-
creetness, and to that of the Church of God, the interests of
our lord the king, and our own, to be duly watched over ;
putting our trust in God as to you, that your brotherly love
will, in your pontifical character, show all due regard to the
Apostolic precepts and our own. We do, therefore, in virtue
of your obedience, enjoin, and, on the strength of the autho-
rity which has been conferred upon us, command you, that, for
the purpose of performing the Apostolical mandate issued to
all the archbishops and bishops of England, as also to all other
your brethren whatsoever, you will with all speed convene the

same, to the end that the iniquity of the laity may no longer
cast a slur on the Church of God and its priesthood, and lest,
through any tergiversation or dissimulation, their malice may
be imputed as a crime to yourselves. But as to the order
which our lord the pope has given with regard to the person
of John, earl of Mortaigne, we have modified the same, defer-
ring the occasion until the Lord's day when "l&to mihi" bb is
sung ; to the end that, if in the meantime he shall think fit to
repent, we may return thanks to God for the same, and in his
behalf, in the sight of our lord the pope, and of our lord the
king of England, the champion of Him who was crucified,
pour forth our affectionate prayers, that he may be deemed
deserving of pardon for his offence, and give him our stre-
nuous aid and all efficacious attention, saving always our
fealty to our lord the king, and the honor of our priestly
office. Eut, on the lands of those excommunicated, you are
to permit the celebration of no Divine service, the baptism of
children and penance excepted. The names of those who have
been excommunicated by our lord the pope, and have been
denounced as such by ourselves, of whose doings the evidence
is so notorious that it cannot by any equivocation on their part
be invalidated, are as follows : Walter, archbishop of Rouen,
Godfrey, bishop of Winchester, Hugh, bishop of Coventry,
William Marshal, Geoffrey Fitz-Peter, William Bruyere, Hugh
Bardolph, Richard Malebisse and his brother Hugh, James
and Simon Fitz- Simon, Simon de Avranches, Roger Fitz-
Remfray, Gilbert and Rainfrid his sons, Gerard Camville, earl
of Salisbury, John Marshal, earl of Mellent, Gilbert Basset,
Thomas Basset, Henry de Yere, Jocelyn Fitz-Remfray, Stephen
Riddel, chancellor of the earl of Mortaigne ; whom, both as
bishop and as his legate, we do denounce to you as excommuni-
cated ; as also Master Benedict, who, contrary to the statutes
of the king and the kingdom, and against our prohibition, has
dared to employ the seal of our lord the king, together with John,
archdeacon of Oxford. In addition to this, we do distinctly
and in especial order you publicly to denounce, as excommuni-
cated, Hugh, bishop of Coventry, whom we have solemnly
excommunicated, not only because in word and deed he has
disowned the bishop, and because he gave his bodily oath at
the hand of Baldwin, archbishop of Canterbury, of pious
memory, as to not holding courts, but also because he has been

A.D. 1191. THE BISHOP OF ELY IS DISGRACED. 245

manifestly a counsellor and adviser to the entire subversion
of the realm of England, a disturber of the peace, and a public
advocate against the royal dignity and interests ; and to cause
him to be strictly avoided by all, that in future a sheep so
diseased may not be able to blemish and corrupt the flock of
the Lord. But Hugh Bardolph, who took no part in our ex-
pulsion and confinement, we do except from the said sentence
of excommunication, if, immediately upon being warned, he
shall surrender the castles of Scarborough, and those throughout
the whole of Yorkshire and Westmoreland which he holds in
his hands, to William de Stuteville. You are also to forbid all
persons in your diocese, under pain of excommunication, to do
anything in obedience to those who conduct themselves in
England as though they were justices, or in any way to obey
a power founded on violence and usurpation. Farewell."

The said bishop of Ely also wrote to Hugh, bishop of Lin-
coln, to the following eifect :

" William, by the grace of God, bishop of Ely, legate of
the Holy Apostolic See, and chancellor of our lord the king,
to his venerable brother and friend, by the same grace, bishop
of Lincoln, greeting. By that authority which has been con-
ferred upon us, we do command you, and in virtue of your
obedience enjoin, that you seize and take into your own hands,
and retain possession of, the archdeaconry and all the revenues
of John, archdeacon of Oxford, until such time as you shall
have received commands from the Apostolic See, or from our-
selves ; inasmuch as with his uncle, the Pilate of Eouen, he is
disturbing the peace and tranquillity of the kingdom of Eng-
land, and is seeking to do whatever mischief he possibly can
to our lord the king and to his realm, as being an enemy of
the realm and to ourselves. For, by the authority of our lord
the pope, we have placed him under the ban of excommuni-
cation. Farewell."

The said bishop of Ely also wrote to a similar effect to some
others of the bishops of England ; though not one of them per-
formed the commands of either the Apostolic See or of him-
self; as they did not consider him as legate, or as the king's
chancellor. But the said archbishop of Eouen, and the other
justices of England, deprived him of his bishopric, and col-
lected his revenues for the behoof of the king, in return for
the king's treasures which he had made away with.

After this, the said justices and all the bishops, earls, and



246 AKNALS OF EOGEE DE HOVEDEtf. A.D. 1191.

barons of England joined in a letter, and wrote word to the
king how his chancellor had laid waste the kingdom of Eng-
land and his treasures, and how, by the common consent of
the kingdom, he had been deposed. On the other hand, the
chancellor wrote to the king, signifying how that his brother
John had taken possession of his kingdom, and would place the
crown on his own head, unless he should make haste and return
with all speed.

Of the return of Philip, king of France, from Acre, and of his
journey.

But now let us return to the king of France, who, in the
meantime, leaving the object of his pilgrimage unperformed,
had departed from the land of Jerusalem with fourteen galleys,
and had passed before the city of Baruth, which was then in
the hands of the pagans ; but he did not attack them. He next
passed before the city of Sibelet and before the castles of Bitte-
rus and of Hesse, and then came to the city of Tripolis, where
he made a stay of some days. Departing thence, he passed
before the castle of Arches, the castle of Albe, and Le Culiat,
a castle of the Hospitallers. He next came to the episcopal
city of Turcusa. It is worthy of remark, that before Turcusa
there is an island in the sea, Aredosa by name, for which reason
Turcusa is called the " Aredosan city." He next came to the
good harbour of Maureda, departing from which place he passed
before Margat, a castle of the Hospitallers, where Isaac, em-
peror of Cyprus, was kept confined in chains. He next came
to the city of Valentia, then to the city of Sibel, then to the
city of Melida, and then to the port of Saint Simeon. He
next arrived before the city of Antioch, departing from which
he came to the port of Bunel, then to the port of Alexandrietta.
After this, he entered the land of the Armenians, which is
called Armenia, and is the territory of Rupin de la Montaigne,
being held under the prince of Antioch. He next came to a large
river, the name of which is Thil, where there is a good city,
which in like manner is called Thil. He then came to a
large river called Curk, where there is a fine city deserted,
also called Curk. He next came to a third large river, which
is called Salef, where, upon this river, there is a large city,
which is in like manner called Salef. It was in this river Salef
that Frederic, emperor of the Eomans, was drowned, when he
was leaving the territories of the sultan of Iconium.



A-D. 1191. EETTJEN OF THE KING OF FEAtfCE FKOM ACHE. 247

It is also worthy to be known, that from this territory caine
those three kings who offered to our Lord Jesus Christ three
precious gifts, namely, gold, frankincense, and myrrh. Their
names were as follow : Jesphar, Pabtrar, 55 and Melchior ; ol
whom one was king of Salef, which is called the 'Island,' ano-
ther the king of Malnustre, and the third was the king of Ter-
zol, that is to say, Tarsis, as to which it is said in the Psalms, 5fi
" The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents."
It is also worthy to be known, that these three rivers, Salef,
Curk, and Thil, rise in Turkia, which is the name of the land
of the Turks, who are subjects of the sultan of Iconium ;
these divide the land of the Turks from the land of Rupin de
la Montaigne, and fall into the sea near the gulf of Satalia.
The river also, which is called Salef, is opposite to the island
of Cyprus, and is not distant from it more than fifty miles, ac-
cording to the calculations of mariners, as people can easily
see from one shore to the other. 57

When the king of France had left this river Salef, he passed
near some very high mountains, which are called Cathimerdes.
He next passed before a castle, the name of which is Nesse-
kim, and then came to a fine city called Stamere, in which
there is a noble abbey of the Griffons. He next passed a de-
serted castle, which is called the castle of Eote, and then came
to a river, which is called Scalendros : this river divides the
territories of the Armenians from those of the emperor of Con-
stantinople. Here, on one side of this river, in the territory
of the emperor of Constantinople, is a castle, which is called
Antiochet, 58 while on the other side of the same river, in
Armenia, there is a castle, the name of which is Isanci. When
the king of France arrived at the castle of Antiochet, Constan-
tine, the lord of the castle, received him with marks of joy,
and supplied him and his people with all necessaries. The
king of France made a stay there of eight days, and dubbed the
eldest son of the said Constantino a knight. It is also worthy
to be known, that the whole land which extends from the
river Scalendros towards the north as far as the sea is the ter-
ritory of the emperor of Constantinople, which is called Ro-
mania, that is to say, Graacia.

After taking his departure thence, he immediately entered
the gulf of Satalia. It is called a gulf, when water ex-
tends inward between two lands, and forms a bay. Satalia
is a very fine castle, and from it the gulf takes its name.
Upon this gulf are two castles and cities, both of which are
called Satalia ; but one of these is deserted, and is called Old
Satalia, while the other is called New Satalia, and was found-
ed by Manuel, emperor of Constantinople. Crossing the gulf
of Satalia, the king of France passed a mountain, which is
called Siredune, at the end of the gulf of Satalia. He then
passed a very high mountain, the name of which is called
Eesut. He next came to a river, which is called Winke, 59
upon which there is a deserted castle, which is in like manner
called Resut. This river Winke is also called the Port of the
Pisans, because the Pisan pirates often frequent the harbour.
When the king of France came thither, he found there four
galleys belonging to the pirates, which he took ; but the pirates,
leaving the galleys, fled to the mountainous parts, and so
escaped from his hands.

He next came to the city of Mirrhea, of which Saint Nicho-
las held the bishopric, and which the Greeks call Stamira ; after
which he arrived at a good harbour, and one secure from all
winds and tempests, the name of which is Karkois ; on both
sides of which harbour there were in ancient times fine and
populous cities, the names of which were Cake ; there are also
vast ruins there of walls to the present day, but no one lives
there, through fear of the pirates. They next passed the Isles
of Yse, in one of which there is a castle which is called the
castle of Huge.

Here formerly dwelt a damsel, whose name was Yse, and
from whose name these islands were so called. The natives
tell the story that a certain knight loved this damsel, but she
declined to assent to his wishes so long as she lived. How-
ever, on her death, the knight came and lay with her, saying,
" What I could not do with her when alive, I have done with
her when dead ;" on which Satan immediately entered into
her, and said, " Behold, thou hast begotten by me a son, and
when he is born I will bring him to thee." After nine months,
when the time of travail came, she brought forth a still-born
son, and brought him to the knight, and said, " Behold thy

59 There can be no doubt that most of these names are in a most cor-
rupt state.



A. D. 1191. RETURN OF THE KING OF FRANCE FROM ACRE. 249

first-born son, whom thou didst beget ; cut off his head and
keep it in thy possession. And whensoever thou shalt wish
to vanquish thine enemy, or to lay waste his lands, let the
features of the head so cut off be disclosed, and let them look
upon thy enemy or his lands, and immediately they shall be
destroyed ; and when thou shalt wish to cease so to do, let the
features be covered up again, and tribulation will cease;"
which was accordingly done. Now, a considerable time after
this, the knight married a wife, who often made enquiry
of him, by what art or device he thus destroyed his ene-
mies without arms and without an army ; however, he was
unwilling to tell her, but rebuked her, and made her hold her
peace. But it so happened, that one day, when the knight was
away from home, she approached a chest, in which she hoped
to find this secret of her lord, by means of which he wrought
such mischiefs, and accordingly found in the chest this abomi-
nable head ; on which she immediately ran away, and threw
it into the gulf of Satalia. The mariners have a story that
whenever this head lies with the face upwards, the gulf is in
such a state of commotion that no ship can possibly cross it ;
but when the head lies with the face downwards, then a ship can
pass over. " Let the Jew Apella believe this, I will not." 60

There is also another wonderful thing that takes place once
a month in every year. It seems as though a black dragon of
vast size comes in the clouds of heaven, and plunges his head
into the gulf of Satalia, and sucks up the water, drawing it
up with such violence, that if any ship should chance to be
there, even though it should be laden, it is drawn up and car-
ried aloft. It is therefore necessary for those who wish to avoid
this peril, as soon as they have seen the monster, immediately
to make a great tumult and raise loud cries, beating pieces
of wood together, in order that on hearing the noise the
dragon may be driven away from them. We, however, affirm
that this is not a dragon, but the heat of the sun, that attracts
to itself the waters of the sea. 61

After the king of France had left the Isles of Yse, he passed
near a great mountain, on the summit of which is situate the
city of Patara, upon which Saint Nicholas was born, and
where he lived for a long time. He next passed near a very
lofty mountain, Turkia by name, which divides the territory

60 From Juvenal. 6l He evidently alludes to waterspouts, and the

method of breaking them by means of sound



250 ANNALS OF EOGEE DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1191.

of the emperor of Constantinople from that of the sultan of
Iconium. After this begins Eomania, which is also called
Graecia. The whole of Eomania is land on the continent, and
under the dominion of the emperor ; in the sea there are also
many islands, which are called the Isles of Eomania. The
capital of Eomania is the city of Constantinople. Eomania is
joined to Sclavonia, Hungaria, Istria, and Aquileia.

The names of some of the principal islands which are in
the Grecian sea are as follow : The island of Sicily, which
belongs to the king of Sicily; the island of Crete, which is
large and fertile, and in the middle of which is a large moun-
tain, called the Mountain of the Camel ; the island of Ehodes ;
the island of Cyprus ; the island of Biscopia ; the island of
Ischia, in which island grows abundance of the substance
called mastic ; the island of Ysania ; the island of Ynexea ;
the island of Stuple ; the island of Mil ; the island of Quales ;
the island of Cuuerfu ; 62 the island of Serfent ; the island of
Sasent; the island called Falede-Campan ; the island of Andros,
and the island called Tine. Many however, of these, are de-
serted, through fear of the pirates, and in many of them
pirates dwell. There are also some other islands, of which we
have previously made mention, and many besides which are
not mentioned in this book.

When the king of France had passed the Cape of Turkia,
he came to the isle of Ehodes, and remained there some days
at the city called Ehodes, which was built by Herod, who
caused the head of Saint John the Baptist to be cut off, and
given to the dancing damsel in a charger. Between the isle of
Ehodes and Eomania there is a broad expanse of sea, twenty
miles wide, according to the mariners. It is also worth know-
ing, that when the isle of Ehodes has been reached, one third
of the voyage has been accomplished between Acre and Brin-
disi. Between Acre and Brindisi the distance is computed at
one thousand eight hundred miles ; and between Marseilles
and Sicily it is computed at one thousand six hundred miles ;
and between Sicily and Acre the distance is computed at one
thousand six hundred miles. In the middle of the passage
between Marseilles and Sicily lies the island of Sardinia ; and
in the middle of the passage betwen Sicily and Acre is the
island of Crete. It is also worthy to be known, that, if they
have a fair wind who are desirous to proceed from Marseilles
62 Here we can recognize a name known to us, Corfu.



A.D. 119L DESCRIPTION OF THE AECHIPELAGO. 251

to Acre, they will leave the island of Sardinia, the island of
Sicily, and the island of Crete at a great distance on the
left side of the ship ; and, if they keep straight on in their
course, 63 will not see land until they see the land of Sulia. This
way also is the shorter and safer one ; but they must take care
not to steer their course too much to the right hand side of the
ship, on account of Barbary and many other islands in which
the pagans live under the rule of the emperor of Africa. But gal-
leys cannot go by that route, or even attempt it ; for, if a storm
overtakes them, they will quickly founder ; for which reason
they are obliged always to coast along the shore. The person,
too, who wishes to pass along the coast of Romania, from the
Cape of Turkia, will have to pass a very lofty mountain, which
is called Serfent, near which mountain begins the Arm of
Saint George, through which you pass to the city of Constan-
tinople.

Next, on the coast of Eomania, is Maluaise, a large moun-
tain. Then comes the gulf of Witun, at the head of which
gulf is a fine and well-fortified castle, which is called Maine.
At the head of this gulf also is a fine large episcopal city,
which is called Curun, where grow such large quantities of
olives, that it is said that jn the whole world there is no place
where there is made such vast quantities of olive oil. At the
mouth of the said gulf of Witun is the deserted city of
Muscun, which was destroyed by Roger, king of Sicily ; and,
before the entrance of this city are two islands : one of which
is called Sapientia, and the other the Isle of Vultures. After
passing this, not more than about twenty miles from the land
there is a crag of round form, and very dangerous, being nearly
sunk in the waves, the name of which is Tiffat. Between this
crag and Muscun, the distance is computed to be fifty miles.
It is necessary for those who pass this way not to take their
ships out to too great a distance from the shore, until they
have passed this dangerous spot.

Beyond this, about a hundred miles from this perilous
spot, is an island out at sea called Serfent : this, and two other
islands, one of which is called Cephalenia, and the other Jagert,
are islands belonging to Margarite. Next comes port Guiscard.
It deserves to be known that Robert Guiscard was born in
Normandy, and, being made a knight, was long one of the

Richard.

household of Henry, king of England, son of "William the
Bastard. Although he was a knight of prowess in arms, he
was still unable to find any favour with the king, whereby to
enrich himself. In consequence of this, with his wife and
children and brother, he left Normandy and went to Rome ;
where, having received from the Supreme Pontiff permission
and advice to subjugate the barbarous nations, a great multi-
tude of valiant men resorted to him as his adherents. On
this, he departed thence, and, entering Apulia, on seeing that
it was a fine and fertile country, and that its inhabitants were
unskilled in arms, he often attacked them with a strong and
armed hand, and conquered them, and took possession of their
territory. The whole of Apulia, Calabria, and the principality
of Capua he also subjugated, and, taking them out of the hands
of the emperor of the Romans, gave them to his son Tancred.

He then collected a large fleet, boasting that he would in-
vade the empire of Constantinople, and subjugate the whole
thereof. In the meantime, while his fleet was being equipped,
it happened that he, and Tancred, and Boamund, his sons, on
the same day, fought with our lord the pope, the emperor of
the Romans, and the emperor of Constantinople ; Robert Guis-
card himself engaging with the emperor of Constantinople,
one of his sons with the pope, and the other with the em-
peror of the Romans ; and he, and each of his sons, gained
a victory on one and the same day. After this, Robert Guis-
card embarked on board of his fleet, and his wife with him, and
subjugated the island of Cuuerru, the island of Crete, the Isle
of Rhodes, and many other islands, which he took from the em-
peror of Constantinople. He next came to the harbour which
now, after his name, is called Port Guiscard. While he was
preparing to proceed thence, and to enter Romania, the empe-
ror of Constantinople, being in great dread of his approach, sent
word to his wife, that, if she would put to death the said
Robert Guiscard, and so free his territories from all dread of him,
he would marry her, and make her empress of Constantinople.

On this, the woman agreed to what the emperor requested ;
and, having gained an opportunity both as to time and place,
gave her husband, Robert Guiscard, poison to drink : on which
he died, and was buried in the island which to this day is called
Port Guiscard, and the whole of his army was dispersed. The
woman fled to the emperor of Constantinople, who imme-
diately fulfilled all his promises, and married her, and had her



A.D. 1191. EOGER CROWNED THE FIRST KING OF SICILY. 253

crowned empress ; and when all the proper solemnities had
been performed, both as to the marriage, the coronation, and
the nuptial ceremonies, so becomingly, that she said to the
emperor, " My lord, you have now graciously performed all
the terms of our agreement, " the emperor caused silence to be
made, and in the presence of all, showed the agreement which
he had made with her, and how she had put her husband to
death, and then requested them to pronounce judgment upon her;
on which, they condemned her to death. Accordingly, she was
removed from the nuptial ceremony to the place of punish-
ment, and was thrown upon a lighted pile, and reduced to
ashes.

Roger, the brother of the said Guiscard, waged war with
the people of Sicily, and subjected the whole of that island,
and became the earl of Sicily. This Sicily is a large island,
and, before the said Roger subdued it, was inhabited by pa-
gans, and under the dominion of the emperor of Africa. But
Roger before-mentioned, having expelled the pagans, esta-
blished the Christian religion, and erected in it two arch-
bishoprics and six bishoprics. After this, he married a wife,
by whom he had an only son, whom, after his own name, he
called Roger, and made him duke of Apulia, and gave to him
Calabria and the principality of Capua, after the decease of
Tancred, the son of Robert Guiscard, without issue. The said
Roger, earl of Sicily, then died ; on which, his son Roger,
duke of Apulia, succeeded him in the earldom of Sicily, and
shortly after, with the consent of his earls and barons, caused
himself to be crowned king of Sicily; and thus the said
Roger was crowned the first king of Sicily. He married a
wife, and by her had two sons and one daughter ; the first of
whom was called Roger, and the other William, 64 while his
daughter was called Constance. He gave to his eldest son the
dukedom of Apulia and the principality of Capua. This son
married against the will of his father, and by his wife had an
only son, whom he called Tancred; after which he died, in the
lifetime of his father.

After this, his father died, who was king of Sicily, and was
succeeded in the kingdom by his son William, who married,
and by his wife had an only son, whom he called William,
after his own name. This William, last-mentioned, succeeded
his father in the kingdom, and gave to Tancred, the son of his

uncle, the earldom of Laleche. He also gave Constance, the
sister of his uncle, in marriage to Henry, king of the Germans,
son of Frederic, emperor of the Romans. He also caused the
kingdom of Sicily to be secured to him on oath in succession
to himself, in case he should die without issue ; shortly after
which, "William, king of Sicily, married Joanna, daughter of
Henry, king of England, son of the empress Matilda ; he died
however, without issue.

On his decease, Tancred, the earl of Laleche above-men-
tioned, unmindful of the oath which, with the rest, he had taken
to Henry, king of the Germans, usurped the kingdom of Sicily,
and was crowned king thereof. On Henry, emperor of the
Romans, hearing of this, he levied a large army and entered
the territory of king Tancred, bringing with him his wife
Constance, who was heir to the kingdom of Sicily ; and then
laying siege to Salerno, within fifteen days, that place was sur-
rendered to him and his wife, whom he left there. Proceeding
thence he laid siege to Naples, where having stayed six weeks,
in that time he lost nearly the whole of his army through pesti-
lence ; he himself also fell sick and nearly died. When he saw
that he could not effect his object, he took his departure, and
went to his city of Milan. On the people of Salerno hearing
of this, they laid hands on their mistress, the empress Constance,
and detaining her, delivered her to Tancred, king of Sicily ; on
which the emperor of Germany, grieving and in confusion at
the loss of his wife, wrote to pope Celestinus, that by his aid
he might recover her : and after some time, by the intervention
of our lord the pope, he was restored to him.

"When Philip, king of France, had taken his departure from
the isle of Rhodes, and had come to the coast of Romania, he
passed a great mountain which has the name of the Cape of
Melia ; after which he came to the gulf of Witun, and passed
by the castle of Maine. He next came to a city which is called
Curun, and then to a deserted city, the name of which is Mun-
zum, which lies at the end of that gulf. He then passed by
the island of Triffat, and then came to the islands, of which the
one is called Cephalenia and the other Fale de Compar. These
two islands are called 66 Port Guiscard. On the opposite
side, in Romania, there is a town called Saint Salvator, where,
at nearly all seasons, pirates are lying in wait for passers-by.

c6 This does not agree with what he has said before as to Cephalenia
and Port Guiscard. See p. 251.

A.D. 1191. DESCRIPTION OP THE COAST OF EOMAN1A. 255

On the king of France departing thence, he came to the island,
the name of which is Cuuerfu. At the entrance of the isle of
Cuuerfu, towards the land of Sulia, there are dangerous sands,
extending through the middle from the island of Cuuerfu to
the coast of Romania; the sea being not deeper upon the
sands than four ells and a half. The island of Cuuerfu is large
and fertile, and yields a yearly revenue to the emperor of Con-
stantinople of fifteen quintals of gold a quintal being a hun-
dred pounds. The island of Cuuerfu is six miles distant from
Romania, and in some places the sea is so narrow between
Cuuerfu and Romania, that from one shore to the other one
man may be heard by another. The length of Cuuerfu is fifty
miles ; and between Cuuerfu and Apulia, the distance is com-
puted to be one hundred miles. Cuuerfu can easily be seen
by those in Apulia, but not the converse, because Apulia lies
low, and Cuuerfu is high land.

At the extremity of the island of Cuuerfu, in Romania,
there is a deserted castle, the name of which is Butentrost, in
which the traitor Judas was born. After this, when you have
almost come to the entrance of the straits, there is a deserted
city at the extremity of the island of Cuuerfu, which is called
Gaszope, in which there is such a vast quantity of serpents that
no one dares to land near it on that side. Just opposite to
it, on the coast of Romania, is a deserted city, the name of
which is Santa Carenta, where there is a good harbour, wide
and deep. At the mouth of this harbour, at the entrance of the
straits, there is a rock resembling a half-ruined tower, which
extends almost to the middle of the harbour and lies concealed
beneath the waves, so that it is necessary for those passing by
to hug the shore of the island of Cuuerfu. At the extremity of
the island of Cuuerfu are four islands, the name of one of
which is Fanum. After this, about forty miles from the island of
Cuuerfu, there is a lofty mountain on a cape of Romania, which
is called Paxo ; from this mountain to Octrente, 67 an archiepis-
copal city in Apulia, is a distance of fifty miles ; and from this
mountain to Brindisi, a hundred miles.

At this mountain, called Paxo, begins the Gulf of Venice,
which is a hundred and fifty miles in length and a hundred in
width. Persons passing up this gulf, on their way to Venice,
will leave behind Romania, Sclavonia, and Istria. In Apulia,
on the sea-coast, are the ports known by the following names :
6 ? Otranto.



256 ASTNALS or EOGEE DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1191.

the first port of Apulia is called Leuke ; next to which is a
port called Castre, then the port called Octrente, next the
port called Leliche, and then the harbour called Brandiz, the
same as Brindisi. After this, you come to the port of Mono-
pola, and the port of Bar, where Saint Nicolas reposes ; then
the port of Trani, and next the port of Barlet. You next
come to the port of Sipontum, then the port of Bestia, and
then that of Tremula. This port of Tremula is the last port
of Apulia. After this comes Ortona, the first port of the ter-
ritory of Venice ; then the port of Atri, and then the port of
Pescara ; after which you come to the ports of Ancona, and of
Ravenna, and then to Venice, a splenoid city with a fine har-
bour.

When the king of France had arrived at Cuuerfu, he sent
envoys to king Tancred, and asked his permission to pass
through his territories, which was accordingly granted him.
He then came to Apulia, where he landed at Octrente, on the
sixth day before the ides of October, being the fifth day of the
week. Proceeding thence, he sent his forerunners to Henry,
emperor of the Romans, and asked his leave to pass through
his territories ; which permission was granted him. On his
arrival at Rome, he said many evil things of the king of Eng-
land, in presence of our lord the pope and of all the car-
dinals, asserting that the king of England had forced him to
leave the land of Jerusalem, and accusing him of treachery.
However, neither our lord the pope nor the cardinals put any
faith in his words, knowing that this proceeded rather from
envy than from any bad conduct on the part of the king of
England. Our lord the pope, however, received him with all
honor and attention, and supplied him with all things neces-
sary for a period of eight days. Moreover, in consideration of
the love of God and his own affection, he devised a new method
of relief for the pilgrims ; for, both the king, and all who
had come with him, or who came after him, he absolved from
their vows, and from going on the expedition to Jerusalem,
and, even though they had not performed their vows, he still
distributed palms among them, and hung crosses from their
necks, thus enacting that they were pilgrims. After this, the
king of France prevailed upon the emperor of the Romans to
lay hands upon the king of England, in case he should pass
through his territory.
The king of France, upon arriving at length in his own terri-

tory, defamed the king of England with his neighbours, mak-
ing many charges against him. Producing also the charter of
the king of England which had been executed at Messina, he de-
manded of William Fitz-Ralph, the seneschal of Normandy, his
sister Alice, whom the king of England was to have taken to wife;
the seneschal of ISTormandy, however, refused to give her up.

In the same year, Hugh, bishop of Lincoln, while making
his visitation of the houses of the religious in his diocese,
came to the abbey of the nuns at Godstow, which lies between
Oxford and Woodstock. On entering the church to pray, he
saw a tomb in the middle of the choir, before the altar, covered
with cloths of silk, and surrounded with lamps and tapers; on
which he asked whose tomb it was, and was told that this was
the tomb of Eosamond, who had formerly been the mistress of
Henry, king of England, son of the empress Matilda, and that
he, for love of her, had shown many favours to that church. On
this the bishop made answer: " Take her away from here, for
she was a harlot; and bury her outside of the church with the rest,
that the Christian religion may not grow into contempt, and
that other women, warned by her example, may abstain from
illicit and adulterous intercourse;" which was accordingly
done.

In the same year, Hugh, bishop of Coventry, expelled the
monks of Coventry from the cathedral church of his diocese,
and placed canons secular therein. In the same year also, the
monks of Canterbury made choice of Reginald, bishop of Bath,
as their archbishop ; but just then he fell ill and died, fifteen
days after his election, and was buried at Bath. In the same
year, Hugh, bishop of Durham, in consequence of the feelings
of indignation which he entertained towards Geoffrey, arch-
bishop of York, used every possible endeavour to obtain a
release from all subjection to him, on which the said Geoffrey
wrote to him to the following effect :

The Letter of Geoffrey, archbishop of York, to Hugh, bishop of
Durham.

" Geoffrey, by the grace of God, archbishop of York and
primate of England, to Hugh, by the same grace, bishop of
Durham, greeting. While, with all ardour you have been
hastening onward with impetuous career to reach the highest
position among the clergy, you have made choice to become the
master of all others, and wish to be subject to no one. And

indeed in your case we see the words fulfilled, * I will ascend
into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God :
I will be like the most High ;' 69 while you do not keep in
mind the words, ' God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to
the humble; 570 and that < He that exalteth himself shall be
abased, and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.' 71 For
both ourselves and our church of York you are zealously, in-
deed with the ardour of an enemy, attacking, contrary to your
own profession and the obedience due to ourselves and to the
church of York ; desiring to withdraw and exempt yourself,
which may God prevent, from our jurisdiction. Wherefore we,
wishing, as becomes us, to consult the rights of our church and
our own dignity, do, by the Apostolic authority and our own,
strictly enjoin you, as being our suffragan, on the Monday
next ensuing after the feast of Saint Michael, to be present at
York at the synod held there in our mother church, and on no
pretext whatsoever to delay so to do, for the purpose of shewing
due reverence to ourselves, and of paying canonical obedience,
in conformity with the Apostolic mandate oftentimes shewn to
you by our letters and in our behalf ; as also to make answer
why for the last two years you have presumed, contrary to the
ordinances of the law, to deprive our church of York of the
processions from ancient times its due, and the oblations due on
the day of Pentecost, from Hovedenshire and Alvertonshire, 72
and why, not dreading to put your sickle in the harvest of
another, you have usurped the power to administer in spiritual
things to our clergy and those of our diocese."

On hearing this, Hugh, bishop of Durham, would neither come
to him nor do obedience or make profession thereof to him. For
he said that he had once already done obedience and made pro-
fession to the church of York, and to Roger, archbishop of that
see, and that he was not by law bound to repeat it; and, in order
that the said archbishop might not oppress him as to this
matter, he appealed to the presence of the Supreme Pontiff i
first, second, and third time, submitting himself and the cause
of his church to the decision of our lord the pope and of the
Roman Church. The archbishop, however, not paying any
regard to the appeal of the bishop of Durham, in the spirit of
his wrath pronounced sentence of excommunication against

A.D. 1191. LETTER OF POPE CELESTHfrS. 259

the bishop of Durham, relying on the mandate of our lord the
pope, in which it was stated, that if the bishop of Durham
should either be unwilling, or should improperly delay to
pay to him due obedience, he was, all appeal removed, to
compel him by ecclesiastical censure so to do. However, the
bishop of Durham, though he saw that sentence of excom-
munication was pronounced against him, after appeal made by
him to the presence of the Supreme Pontiff, determined not to
observe it, but celebrated Divine service, and caused it to be
celebrated just as boldly as before.

On this, the archbishop broke down the altars where the bishop
of Durham had celebrated divine service, and broke the chalices
with which any one had performed service in his presence in
his own diocese ; he also held as excommunicated his brother
John, earl of Mortaigne, because he had eaten in company
with the bishop of Durham after that sentence was pronounced,
and refused to hold communication with him till he should
come to be absolved, and to make due satisfaction.

When the bishop of Durham found that most people avoided
speaking, and eating or drinking with him, he sent mes-
sengers to pope Celestinus, to relate to him, first in private,
and afterwards in presence of all the cardinals, how rashly
the archbishop of York had pronounced sentence of excommu-
nication against him, paying no regard whatever to his appeal.
On learning this, our lord the pope and all the cardinals pro-
nounced the sentence to be null, and that it should not be
observed. Accordingly, our lord the pope wrote to the follow-
ing effect :

The Letter of pope Celestinus, nullifying the sentence pronounced

upon the bishop of Durham.

11 Celestinus, the bishop, servant of the servants of God, to
his venerable brethren the bishops of Lincoln and Eochester,
and to his dearly beloved son the abbat of Burgh, health and
the Apostolic benediction. Whereas the things which are
enacted by our venerable brethren our fellow bishops, with
prudent circumspection and due precaution, we ought to pre-
serve inviolate, so in like manner those things which are done
inconsiderately, it is our bounden duty to correct with a more
extended foresight, and to reinstate the same in their proper
position. Now inasmuch as our venerable brother Geoffrey, arch-
bishop of York, has pronounced sentence of excommunication

s2



260 AtfNALS OF BOGER DE HOVEDEJf. A. D. 1191.

against our venerable brother Hugh, bishop of Durham, and
certain other persons, and, messengers from them having come to
our presence, a full discussion has been held on both sides in our
consistory in relation to the said sentence and certain other mat-
ters ; we, considering that the sentence that has been fulmi-
nated against him as well as against the other persons, has
been inconsiderately pronounced, and corroborated by no
grounds of reasonable cause for the same, have, by the**advice of
our brethren, publicly pronounced that the same shall not hold
good, nullifying the same, and forbidding that it shall have any
authority whatever. To the end, therefore, that what we have
decreed may in your country be publicly promulgated, we do, by
these Apostolical writings, command you to declare through-
out your churches, that the said sentence has been nullified by
the authority of the Apostolic See ; that the faithful may in
security live in brotherly communion both with the others as
well as with the bishop so unjustly put under the said ban, and
may not in any way avoid intercourse with them on account
thereof. Given at the Lateran."

In addition to this, our lord the pope, by other letters,
directed the said bishops of Lincoln and Rochester and
abbat of Burgh, that if they should ascertain that, after appeal
made to the Roman Pontiff, the archbishop of York had
broken the altars and chalices with which the bishop of Dur-
ham, either himself or by means of another, had celebrated the
mass, then, by reason thereof the bishop of Durham should not
be bound to make any submission to the said archbishop of
York so long as the two should live. When the said arch-
bishop and bishop had come into the presence of the said
delegates at Northampton and a long discussion had taken place
on both sides in relation to the above matters, at length, by the
advice and suggestion of the lord bishop of Lincoln, the dis-
cussion was postponed till the octave of the Nativity of Saint
John the Baptist, in order that, mutually anticipating the de-
cision, they might, by the grace of God, be more easily induced
to agree to a full reconciliation, all things in the meantime
in dispute between them remaining in the same state in which
they then were. It was further resolved, that if a reconcilia-
tion could not in the meantime be effected, the letters directed
by our lord the pope to the delegates, should have the same force
that they would have had, if the said space of time had not in-
tervened ; for such time all exceptions on both sides being saved

and reserved ; it being also arranged that the citation, if it
should be necessary to be made, should be made at the end of
the said intervening time, and in like form to that used on the
day on which it had first been made, that is to say, on the day
of Saint Calixtus.

In the same year, Roger, the constable of Chester, in whose
hands the chancellor had placed the castles of Nottingham and
Tickhill, took two prisoners, Alan de Lee and Peter de Bouen-
court, of the number of those to whom he had entrusted the
charge of the said castles, and hanged them both, because they
had consented to the treachery of Robert de Crokston and Eudo
de Diville, who had delivered those castles to John, earl of
Mortaigne. The earl of Mortaigne, being exasperated at this,
laid waste the whole of his lands which were in his juris-
diction.

In the same year, "William, king of the Scots, sent his
envoys to Celestinus, the Supreme Pontiff, for the purpose of
confirming the liberties of the churches of his realm, and found
grace in the eyes of our lord the pope ; upon which our lord
the pope wrote to him to the following effect :

" Celestinus, the bishop, servant of the servants of God, to
his most dearly beloved son in Christ, William, the illustrious
king of the Scots, health, and the Apostolic benediction.
Whereas all who are subject to the yoke of Christ ought to
find favour and protection with the Apostolic See ; still those,
in especial, is it right to strengthen, with every possible en-
couragement, whose fidelity and dutifulness have been in many
instances experienced; to the end that they may be more
fully induced to gain the favour of His love, and with more
duteous affection show Him all reverence, the more they feel
assured that they shall obtain the pledge of His benevolence
and favour. Wherefore, most dearly beloved son in Christ,
holding in mind the feelings of reverence and dutifulness which,
for a long time past, we have known you to entertain towards
the Roman Church, in the page of this present writing we have
thought fit to enact that the Scottish Church shall be subject to
the Apostolic See, as an especial daughter thereof, without the
intervention of any person whatever ; in which the following
are recognized as the episcopal sees, namely, the churches
of Saint Andrew's, Glasgow, Dunkeld, Dumblane, Brechin,
Aberdeen, Moray, Ross, and Caithness. Also, it is to be lawful
for no one but the Roman Pontiff, or his legate l a later e^ to

pronounce against the kingdom of Scotland sentence of excom-
munication or interdict ; and, if such shall be pronounced, we do
hereby decree that the same shall be of no effect. We do also
add that to no one in future, who is not a native of the kingdom
of Scotland, shall it be permitted to exercise the office of the
legateship therein, except such person as for that especial pur-
pose the Apostolic See shall have commissioned from its own
body. "We do also forbid that the disputes which shall have
arisen as to possessions in that kingdom shall be brought for
judgment before judges appointed out of that kingdom, except
in case of appeal to the Church of Rome. And further, if any
writings shall appear in contravention of this statute of liberties
which have been already obtained, or if hereafter such shall
happen to be obtained, mention not being made therein of this
concession ; in such case nothing shall hence arise to the pre-
judice of yourself or your kingdom in relation to the concession
of this prerogative. And further, the liberties and immunities
granted to you, or to your kingdom, or to the churches estab-
lished therein by the Pontiffs of Rome, our predecessors, and
hitherto observed, we do hereby ratify, and do enact that the
same shall remain, to all future time, inviolate. Let no man,
therefore, presume to infringe upon the enactments of this page
of our constitution and prohibition, or in any way to contra-
vene the same. And if any one shall presume so to do, let
him know that he will incur the indignation of Almighty God
and of the holy Apostles Saint Peter and Saint Paul. Given
at the Lateran, on the third day before the ides of March, in
the first year of our pontificate."

In the same year, after the rebuilding of Cesaraea and Joppa,
the Idng of England gave them both to Geoffrey de Lusignan,
brother of king Guido. After this, the king of England for-
tified the castle of Planes, and then the castle of Maen ; and
on the second day before the Nativity of our Lord, he came
to Tours des Chanalets, and remained there during the
Kativity of our Lord ; after which, he wished to proceed
to lay siege to the city of Jerusalem ; but the duke of Burgundy
and the French refused to follow him : saying, that the king
of France, their lord, forbade them at his departure to stay
any longer in that land. In consequence of this, the king of
England was forced to desist from his purpose, as both men
and money failed him.

. In the same year, Boyac El Emir Amimoli, the emperor

of Africa, (who in the previous year had entered the territory
of the king of Portugal with a large army, and had taken a
castle called Torrenova, and laid siege to a castle called Thomar,
and abandoned them both to the Christians, through fear of
the pilgrims who had come in the fleet of the king of Eng-
land, and who, taking to flight, had pretended that he was
dead, as already mentioned, 72 ) after all the fleet of the king of
England had passed by, assembled a large army, and again
entered the territories of the king of Portugal, and took by
storm the city of Sylves, and Alcaz, and Almada, and Palmella,
and laid waste the territory of the Christians. The king of
Portugal, however, was unable to make head against his forces,
and Boyac El Emir Amimoli gave the before-named cities
which he had taken, to his brother, the king of Cordres, or
Corduba.

It is worthy of remark, that in the territories of the king of
Navarre there is only one episcopal city, the name of which is
Pampeluna ; but there are many castles in this territory ; one
of which is Tudela, situate on the river Ebro, another is
called L'Estella, and there are many others besides. In the
territories of the king of Castille there is only one archiepis-
copal city, the name of which is Tulette, 73 and which lies on
the river Tagus, and has the primacy of Spain ; in the
same state there is also an episcopal city, the bishop of which
is called the bishop of Muscerause, that is to say, Suriens. 7 *
In the same city there is a mountain from which every day
there are taken more than a hundred camel loads [of earth],
and yet it never decreases ; for although a cavern of very great
depth is thereby made, still by the next day it is filled up if
rain had fallen upon it. The earth that is taken thence is car-
ried throughout the adjoining provinces, and is sold for the
purpose of washing the hands and clothes of men, both Chris-
tians and pagans.

The archbishop of Toledo has under him eleven suffragan
bishops; namely, the bishop of Muscerause, the bishop of
Alarchas, which is near Cordres, or Corduba, the bishop of
Plazencia, the bishop of Trugel, 75 the bishop of Avila, the
bishop of Segovia, the bishop of Alarghes, the bishop of Si-
guenza, the bishop of Soyra, the bishop of Osma, the bishop
of Palencia, and the bishop of Bursa. In the kingdom also of

the king of Castille there are more than two hundred fine
castles, of which one is called Le Gruin.

In the territory of the king of Saint Jago there is one arch-
bishopric, namely, that of Saint Jago ; 76 which has under
it eleven suffragans, namely, the bishop of Leon, the bishop of
Sturghe, 77 the bishop of Auzemore, 78 the bishop of Salamanca,
the bishop of Citras Rodrike, 79 the bishop of Cooire, 80 the
bishop of Santa Maria de Lugo, the bishop of Saint Salvador de
Wede, the bishop of Yillamaur, the bishop of Orense, and the
bishop of Tiue. 81 In the kingdom of the king of Saint Jago
there are also many castles.

In the territory of the king of Portugal there is one arch-
bishopric, at a city called Braga ; which has seven suffragans,
namely, the bishop of Portigal, 82 the bishop of Cuvillana, the
bishop of Lamego, the bishop of "VViscou, 83 the bishop of Cu-
numbre, 84 the bishop of Evere, 85 on the borders of the Saracens,
and the bishop of Lisbon, on the river Tagus.

Thence extends the part of Spain, which is called Saracenic,
under the dominion of the emperor of Africa ; and here begins
the territory held by the king of Cordres, or Corduba, the
brother of El Emir Amimoli before-named ; the same place as
Corduba, the city of which Lucan says,

" Corduba me genuit, rapuit Nero, prselia dixi,
Quae gessere pares, hinc socer, inde gener." ^

Here are also the cities of Palmella, Almada, Alchaz, Sylves,
and Santa Maria de Hairun, the city of Badeluz, upon the
river Guadiana, Merida, which was formerly an archiepiscopal
city, Sibylla, 87 which also was formerly an archiepiscopal city,
and which, with Corduba, is situate on the river Guadalquivir,
the city of Granada, and the city of Jubellaria. 38

Next begins the territory of the king of Gahang, likewise
in Spain, and under the emperor of the Africans; this king also is
brother of El Emir Amimoli, and has under his rule the castle
of Gehem, and the city of Baence, the city of Aubdene, the city
of Segurra, as also the city of Malaga, where large quantities of
red morocco leather are made, and the city of Melita, on an
inlet of the sea ; each of which is situate on a river which is
called Segura. Next, still in Saracenic Spain, begins the ter-

ritory of the king of Miircia, who is a brother of the said El
Emir Amimoli ; and in whose rule are the city of Murcia, the
castle of Oriola, the castle of Urgelet, the city of Almeria, the
city of Carthagena, the castle of Chinchele, and the castle of
Lapanne de Scumpere. Next, still in Saracenic Spain, begin
the territories of the king of Valencia, who is brother of the
said Ernir Amimoli, and under whose rule are the castles of
Oedeeb, and Stuve, the city of Valencia, the city of Burrianz,
and Peniscle, and many other fortified places.

Next begins the territory of the king of Arragon, in Spain ;
at the commencement of whose kingdom is the castle of Ampost,
and next the episcopal city of Tortosa. Then comes Saragossa,
an episcopal city, then the castle of Caletau, then the castle of
Doroke, then the castle of Torol, and then Santa Maria Aben-
razin, a city on the borders of the Christians and the pagans.
Next comes Tarragona, an archiepiscopal city, then Tarra-
guna, an episcopal city, then the city of Oske, then the city
of Jake, and then the city of Bide, upon the river Segre.
After this comes the city of Wike, then the city of Barcelona,
then Sain de Urget, 88 then the city of Gironda, then the castle
of Turezla, the name of which once was Purpallar Beyond
Sea. After this come the high mountains called Portas de
Laduse, then Chastillon, and, after that, the castle d'Em-
pires.

Next to this comes the land called Roussillon, in which
there is a fine city called Alne, and then the city of Nar-
bonne, after which come the cities of Bediers, and of Agde, and
then Villeneuve, the bishopric of Magdalena, near to which
is the port of Montpellier, which is called Lates. 89 There are
also many other castles and cities in the kingdom of the king
of Arragon, as already mentioned.

In the year of grace 1 192, being the third year of the reign
of Richard, king of the English, Philip, king of France, was
in France safe and sound, at Fontaine Blaud, 90 on the day of the
Nativity of our Lord, which fell on the fourth day of the week,
insolently boasting that he would before long lay waste the
territories of the king of England. On the same day of the
Nativity of our Lord, John, earl of Mortaigne, brother of
Richard, king of England, was at Hovedene, together with
Hugh, bishop of Durham. On the same day of the Nativity

266 A^NAJIS OF KOGEB. DE HOVEDEtf. A.D. 1102.

of our Lord, queen Eleauor, mother of Hi chard, king of Eng-
land, was at Normandy, at Bonville sur Toke.

On the same day of the Nativity of our Lord, Richard, king
of England, was in the land of Sulia, at Tours, of Ascalon,
intending, after the Nativity of our Lord, to lay siege to the
city of Jerusalem ; and, on the day of Saint Hilary, he held
a conference there with the Templars and Hospitallers and the
whole army, as to besieging the city of Jerusalem. However,
they were of opinion that he ought not to move onward, but
that he should return for the purpose of fortifying Ascalon ;
on which, he proceeded to Ascalon, and fortified it, and in for-
tifying it expended a considerable time.

Fifteen days before Easter, the duke of Burgundy and the
Franks left him, saying that they would stay no longer with
him, unless he would supply them with necessaries ; but the
king declined to supply them with anything. During Lent,
the king of England fortified Blanchward, Galatia, and
Gazere ; and on Easter day he held there a general festival,
in tents outside of the town. After Easter, he rode through
the territories of the pagans, and found their corn ripe;
on which, he caused it all to be gathered by the Christians,
as forming half their supply of corn. He made a stay on the
plains of Ascalon until Pentecost, and, on the last day of
Pentecost, rode to Le Damn, a strongly-fortified castle, near
the great river Euphrates, and in this excursion took prisoners
twenty-four pagans and one Ren, who had formerly been a
Christian, and had denied our Lord Jesus Christ ; on which,
the king set him up as a mark for arrows, and he was
pierced to death. On the Monday after the close of Pentecost,
he laid siege to Le Darun, and on the Friday following took it
by storm, and found there nineteen hundred pagans alive,
whom he at once gave to Henry, count of Champagne.

In the meantime, after Easter, a great dissension had arisen
between the Pisans and the Genoese who were before Acre ;
so much so, that they slew one another ; and the duke of Bur-
gundy, at the request of the Genoese, sent to Tyre for the
marquis Conrad, wishing to appoint him king. On this, the
Pisans sent to the king of England, who at this time was stay-
ing at Ascalon, and informed him of the intentions of the
duke of Burgundy. Accordingly, the king came to Acre, and
demanded of the duke of Burgundy fifteen hundred pounds of
silver which he had lent him ; on which, the duke, not having



A.D. 1192. THE SPIES EETTJEN TO THE XlffG OF EXGLASTD. 267

wherewithal to pay, delivered to the king Carakois, the Sara-
cen, in full satisfaction of the debt.

After this, the king returned to Ascalon ; and, while he was
staying there, two of the servants of the king of the Accini,
or Assassins, who had for a long time served at the court of
the marquis Conrad, and had been members of his household,
slew the said Conrad, in his city of Tyre ; on which, they
were immediately arrested by the bystanders. This took
place on the fifth day before the calends of May. On being
interrogated, they said that they had done this by command of
the king of the Accini, their master ; upon which, one of them
was immediately put to death, while the other was flayed
alive. The Franks, however, averred that this was entirely done
by the suggestion of the king of England. After the assassi-
nation of Conrad, his wife married Henry, count of Champagne,
the nephew of the king of England and the king of France ;
immediately on which, by the choice of the whole army, the
said Henry was elected king of the land of Jerusalem. The
king of England also gave to king Guido the island of Tyre,
in exchange, to hold the same for life. After the capture of
Damn, that is to say, on the same Friday on which the king
of England had taken it, the Franks returned to Ascalon, and
placed themselves at the mercy of the king of England : on
which, the king came there to meet them, and afterwards,
with the consent of the whole army, marched forward to lay
siege to Jerusalem.

When they had come as far as Bethonople, the king rode on
with some of them to view Jerusalem ; and then proceeded
to the chapel of Saint Elias, which is three leagues distant
from Jerusalem. Here he found a certain cross of wood, said to
be made of the wood of that of our Lord, sealed up within the
walls of a chapel, which was called the Cross of the Syrians ;
upon which, he carried it away, and returned to his army. In
the meantime, his spies returned to the king of England, and
informed him that a caravan of Saladin was coming from Baby-
lon to Jerusalem, for the purpose of supplying it with provisions
and arms : the king, accordingly, believed them, and, taking
with him five thousand picked men, went to meet the caravan,
which was escorted by eleven thousand pagans. The king met
them on the vigil of the Nativity of Saint John the Baptist, at
about the first hour of the day, and, engaging with them, gained
a victory, and slew nearly the whole of them, taking possession



268 AJfNALS OF BOGEB DE HOVEDEX. A.D. 1192.

of their spoils, with three thousand camels, and four thousand
horses and mules and she-mules, besides those that were killed.

After having gained this victory, the king returned to Beth-
onople, whence he had set out, and gave to the knights of the
army a portion of the spoils of the slain. After this, holding
a conference with the duke of Burgundy and the Franks, he
offered to make oath that he would proceed to Jerusalem and
lay siege to it, and not depart therefrom as long as he had a single
horse left to eat, until he had taken the city, and requested
that the Franks and the whole of the army would take the same
oath. On this, the duke of Burgundy and the Franks made
answer that they would not take the oath, or remain any longer
in the land, but would depart from it as soon as they could,
in obedience to the commands given to them by the king of
France, their master. Accordingly, they left the king upon
bad terms, and returned to Acre, the king following them.
On this, Saladin immediately came down from the moun-
tains, and laid siege to Joppa, which the king of England had
delivered into the charge of Alberic de Rains ; and, as he
found himself unable to defend it, he surrendered it to Saladin,
upon condition that he might depart with safety to life
and limb. However, after having received from Saladin the
selected arrow as a sign of the treaty with him, on hearing of
the approach of the king of England, he returned to Saladin,
and gave back to him his arrow, and renounced the treaty.
Upon this, Saladin immediately took him prisoner, and cap-
tured the whole of the city, with the exception of the fortress
of the castle ; to which a few retired and sent word to the
king of England to inform him of these recent events : im-
mediately upon which, he gave his troops, consisting of horse,
to Henry, count of Champagne, for the purpose of being led
thither by land, while he himself, with only seven galleys,
proceeded by sea. On the third day, being Saturday, he
arrived at Joppa, on the morning after the feast of Saint Peter
ad Vincula ; on which, he entered the castle, and had an inter-
view with his people there, instructing them to follow him.
After this, he went forth and a few with him, and suddenly
made an attack upon the army of Saladin, and, shouting his
war-cry, he valiantly charged them, and drove them out of the
city, and slew many of them with the edge of the sword, and
so liberated the city from their hands.

Three days after this, Saladin sent word to the king that he



A.D. 1192. THE KIXG OF ENGLAND LANDS AT GAZERA. 269

would fight him in a pitched battle ; which message greatly
pleased the king. But, just as everything had been ready
prepared for the pitched battle, five galleys arrived from Acre
with soldiers, by way of succour for the king : upon which,
Saladin declined to engage with him.

In the meantime, Hugh, duke of Burgundy, Ralph de
Courcy, and the viscount de Pinkenny, died at Acre, on the
eighth day after their arrival there. Shortly after, Saladin
sent word to the king of England that he would repay him
all his expenses which he had been put to in fortifying Ascalon,
and would make with him and the other Christians who should
remain in the land of Jerusalem a truce to last for three years,
from Easter then next ensuing, and would keep the peace
with them until the said time, if he would reinstate Ascalon
in the same condition in which he himself had left it. Ac-
cordingly, the king of England, seeing that both men and
money and health were failing him, by the advice of the Tem-
plars and of the whole army, closed with the said offer which
Saladin had made him : on which, upon oath, they agreed that
peace should be observed for that period.

After this, the king of England placing everything in the
hands of Henry, count of Champagne, hastened to return to his
kingdom, by reason of the sinister reports which he had heard
both as to the king of France and the expulsion of his chan-
cellor, as also the earl of Mortaigne, his brother, who had seized
the castles of the kingdom, and would have taken possession
of the whole thereof if he could have found the opportunity.
Accordingly, the king of England came to Caiaphas, where he
fell sick, and proceeded thence- to Acre. Here, after the feast
of Saint Michael, being the eighth day before the ides of Oc-
tober, and the fifth day of the week, he embarked on board of
a large buss, and, within a month from that day, arrived at the
island of Cuuerfu, where he went on board a boat, and sailed
towards three galleys which he saw on the opposite side off the
coast of Romania, and hired them to take him as far as Ra-
gusa, for two hundred marks of silver; after which, he re-
turned to his buss, and the said galleys with him ; and, having
made terms with them, he took with him Baldwin, the advocate
of Bethune, and twenty other companions, and embarked on
board one of the said galleys ; and on landing at Gazera, near
Ragusa, declined to tell them that he was king of England,
but said that they were pilgrims. However, although he had a



270 ANNALS OF EDGES DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1192.

long beard and long hair and garments, and everything else to
resemble the people of that country, he was unable to remain
unknown, in consequence of his great expenditure, which was
quite foreign to the usage of the people of that country.

Immediately, the people of the province guessing that he
was the king of England, prepared to capture him and deli-
ver him to the emperor of the Romans, who hated him, on
account of the aid he had given to king Tancred, and for the
death of his kinsman, the marquis Conrad. Upon the king of
England being informed of this by one of his followers, he
placed his retinue in charge of Baldwin, the Advocate of
Bethune, and ordered him to remain the next four days at that
place, making a more lavish expenditure than he himself had
done ; after which, he himself, with a single attendant,
having mounted a swift horse, his attendant doing the same,
set out late at night, and, hastening day and night, arrived
in the neighbourhood of Vienna ; at a little village, not far
from which place he and his attendant took up their abode.
While the king's attendant was gone to buy food, the king,
being fatigued by the labour of his journey, immediately
threw himself upon a bed and fell asleep. In the meantime,
his attendant, while endeavouring to exchange some money,
was recognized by a servant of .the duke of Austria, and taken
prisoner, and brought before the duke ; and, when he could
conceal it no longer, disclosed to him the lodging of the king ;
on which, they came, and, finding him asleep, took him pri-
soner. As for the Advocate of Bethune, and those who were
with him, on attempting to leave the town, they were taken
prisoners, and not allowed to depart.

In the meantime, the king of France, holding a conference
with the seneschal and nobles of Normandy, demanded of them
his sister, Alice, whom they had in their charge in the castle
of Rouen : he also demanded the castle of Gisors, the county
of Auch, and the county of Aumarle, and showed him the
written agreement made between him and the king of England,
at Messina. To this, the nobles of Normandy made answer
that they had received no commands upon the subject from
their master, and were, therefore, unwilling to comply with
his demands.

Upon this, the king of France, levying a large army, was
desirous to invade Normandy in a hostile manner, but the
nobles of his kingdom would not agree thereto, saying that our



A.D. 1192. THE NUNS O.F SAINT CLEMENT'S APPEAL TO THE POPE. 271

lord the pope had excommunicated all those who should make
war on the territory of the king of England before his return,
and that they had sworn to keep the peace towards him and
his territory until his return.

During Lent, in the same year, the archbishop of York
came to London by command of the king's justices; but
when he came to Westminster with his cross, he was forbidden by
the bishop of London and the other bishops of England thence-
forth to presume to carry his cross in the province of Canter-
bury. On this, he contumaciously made answer that he would
not lay it aside for them ; but, listening to the advice of his
own people, he hid it from before the face of the people, lest a
tumult might arise among the clergy. The bishop of London,
however, holding him as an excommunicated person, in con-
sequence of this transgression, suspended the New Temple,
at which place the said archbishop of York had taken up his
abode, from the performance of Divine service and from the
ringing of bells, and in consequence, he was obliged to leave
the city ; but before he left, queen Eleanor, the archbishop 01
llouen, himself, and all the nobles of the kingdom, met to-
gether and swore fealty and faithful service to Kichard, king
of England, and his heir, against all men.

During the same Lent, the bishop of Ely, the chancellor,
returned to England, by command of the earl of Mortaigne,
and remained some days in the castle at Dover, not daring to
proceed any further. The earl of Mortaigne, however, in con-
sideration of five hundred pounds of silver which the chancellor
had promised him for the restoration of his office, tried in every
way to induce the chief men of the kingdom to receive the
chancellor in his former position ; but they refused, and sent
word to the chancellor, that if he did not make haste and leave
the kingdom with all speed, they would take him prisoner. On
hearing this, the chancellor, not daring to stay in England against
the will of the chief men, crossed over at the Supper of our Lord.

In the same year, Geoffrey, archbishop of York, gave, and by
his charter confirmed, the priory of Saint Clement's, at York, to
the abbey of Godstow. But the nuns of Saint Clement's, who
had always been free from the very foundation of that church,
refused to pay obedience to the abbey of Godstow, and appealed
to our lord the pope in behalf of the liberties of their church.

In the meantime, the clerks of the archbishop of llouen,



272 AJfNALS OF BOGEB DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1192.

whom he had sent to Borne to oppose the chancellor, wrote to
him to the following effect :

The Letter sent ly Ms clerics to Walter, archbishop of Rouen.

"To Walter, by the grace of God archbishop of Rouen,
their most dear lord and father, his clerks, greeting. We will
omit the perils and labours which in our journey we have
oftentimes been obliged to endure, and how, after having
frequently escaped from dangers by the way, we at length fell
into the hands of robbers, and, being despoiled of all our pro-
perty, except a few horses and our letters, arrived destitute
of all provision whatever in this magnificent city, on the third
day before the ides of February, the court then staying at the
church of Saint Peter. Here we found the clerks sent by
the chancellor, uttering many boasts, and, as it appeared to us,
exulting in complete success. For the office in full of legate
having been granted to him, our lord the pope and certain of
the cardinals had sent letters to the bishop of Ely addressed
therein as legate, but the principal letters conferring the legate-
ship under the authority of the bull not having been yet de-
livered, the deputies before-mentioned were preparing for their
speedy departure. Moreover, we found the pope fully inclined
to take the part of the chancellor ; while those who, as his
familiar friends, are much in the society of our lord the pope,
and are constantly at his side, were promoting his interests as
though they were their own. However, by the grace of God,
in consequence of our arrival, those letters were detained, some
persons who zealously attend to our interests, often and re-
peatedly remarking that the presence of your deputies had
hitherto been much needed. After this, as soon as we had ob-
tained permission, having gained an audience, in the presence of
our lord the pope and the whole of the cardinals, we presented
the letters sent by you, and by the bishops, prelates, and justi-
ciaries of England, with due care adding thereto all other
things that we believed were consistent with your intentions.
After the deputies of the bishop of Ely had made an attempt
to raise objections both to our answers and our assertions, our
lord the pope made many remarks militating against your in-
terests, with indignation and bitterness, inculcating in many
words, and affirming as follows : We know that the illustri-



A.D. 1192. LETTEK TO THE AliCHBISHOP OF EOUEX. 273

ous king of the English left the administration of the whole
of his kingdom to our lord of Ely, and left no one his equal
or superior. We have seen letters of our lord the king to
that effect ; those which revoke them or are contrary thereto
we have not seen, nor do we see, nor yet a signed copy thereof
with the seals thereto appended and duly authenticated.
However, many venerable persons have written against the
lord chancellor ; and in favour of the lord chancellor we have
received letters from many venerable persons. But the letters
that you bring are from those who have expelled the lord
chancellor ; and we are not very much surprised if they do
seem to write in their own favour. "We know that our lord
the king never showed to any mortal so much love, or paid
such high honor, as he has done to our lord of Ely. He made
him not only bishop of the venerable and most wealthy see of
Ely, but his chancellor as well, and, besides, has entrusted
to his sole charge the whole of the kingdom of England.
And yet, with all this our lord the king was not content, but
begged our lord Clement of happy memory, and ourselves as
well, to bestow the office of legate upon the lord chancellor.
Consider how affectionately he loved him ; what man is there
whom he loves as much, or has loved ? At the entreaty of our
lord the king, and at his urgent request, we have granted the
legateship for the present to the lord bishop of Ely. That the
king has withdrawn such great favour thus suddenly from the
man whom he used to love we can hardly believe, unless we
see his letter and the royal seal. And what we have granted
to our lord the king, to wit, the legateship of our lord of Ely,
we cannot possibly suspend or take away without suffering the
stigma of falsehood. Moreover, all the bishops of England
have sent us letters begging us to confirm him in the office of
legate, and, unanimously supplicating us, have put forward
many recommendations in favour of the chancellor. And that
now, the contrary should be asked by them, seems to us to de-
serve to be imputed to a feeling of levity. Even your own
master, too, the archbishop of Eouen, sent to us letters, full
of professions of devotion, in favour of the bishop of Ely ; in-
asmuch as he could write in his favour as long as he enjoyed
prosperity. Consequently, it is a hard matter to listen to those
against him, when oppressed with the calamity of exile, as to
whom it has been written, ' So long as you are fortunate, you
will reckon many a friend; if the times become cloudy,

VOL. II. T



274 ANNALS OF EOGER DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1192.

then you will be alone.' 91 Moreover, when he was exulting
in his former state of prosperity, and was performing the duties
of legate among you, what church, what monastery, what bene-
ficed clergyman, what person of low station or of high, ever sent
word or complaint to us about the exactions of the lord bishop of
Ely, or any grievances of the churches r All applauded him
when prosperous, all murmur against him when fallen. These
were friends of fortune, who took their leave together with the
favour of fortune." These and many other objections made by
our lord the pope could not be otherwise than of great weight
and moment, as being put forward by one who has no supe-
rior, a Supreme Pontiff and a judge, and one whose will there is
no one to resist. Still more, it seemed to some to make very
greatly against us, that our lord the king of England, upon
your return, had begged in your behalf that your legateship
might be transferred to the parts of Normandy and other parts
beyond sea ; consequently, at the first blush it seemed likely to no
one that it was the king's wish that you should hold authority in
England, and the office of legate in Normandy, inasmuch as for
one and the same man to hold authority in England and the
office of legate in Normandy, seemed a thing neither easy nor
convenient. Moreover, the intimation of the royal wish,
which had been sent in your behalf to the chancellor by the
king, was said to have been transmitted by the king to the
seneschal of Normandy, in order that he might in Normandy
enjoy the benefit of your counsel. Although we made suitable
answers to these objections and the like, still the favour of our
lord the pope and his predilections leaned on the other side.
However, being at length forced to feel some hesitation, both at
our instance as also at that of some of the cardinals whom we
had got to favour our views, having called all the cardinals to-
gether, he required the opinion of each ; and, after our busi-
ness had been discussed in many deliberations, adjourned from
time to time for a long period, our lord the pope, sitting in
judgment, pronounced sentence to the following effect, that is
to say, to state it shortly and in a condensed form ; he ab-
solved the chancellor from your denunciation and that of
our lord the dean of llouen, and, conversely, he publicly ad-
judged to be null and void the sentence which the bishop of

91 A quotation from Ovid :

" Dum fueris felix, multos numerahis amicos ;
Tempora si fuerint nubila, solus eris."



A.D. 1192. LETTEK, TO THE AECHBISHOP OF ROUEN. 275

Ely had pronounced under the pretext of certain letters 92 against
you and the dean and certain others who were obnoxious to
the chancellor. Moreover, our lord the pope, proceeding in his
sentence, pronounced the chancellor excused for the injury ho
had done to the archbishop of York without any prescribed
form [of trial]. He also declined to take away from him
either his legateship or the powers attached thereto, as he had
but lately conferred the same at the urgency of the king's entrea-
ties, and at the request of yourself as well as of all the bishops
of England. However, he pronounced that he should perform
the duties of the legateship with this exception thereto ap-
pended, that in the meantime he should not have the power of
pronouncing sentence of suspension or excommunication against
you, or against the dean of Rouen, or against the bishops of
England, or the justiciaries and nobles thereof. Of this sen-
tence we trust that we shall have a more precise version, and
that we shall be enabled to transmit to you the very words
themselves in the letters of the pope himself. To the said
judgment he also added, that, convoking a council of the car-
dinals, and inviting ourselves thereto as well as the depu-
ties of the lord bishop of Ely, he will nominate some venerable
persons in your parts through whose mediation peace and re-
conciliation may possibly be effected between you and the
lord chancellor, at least so far as to assuage the rancorous feel-
ings that exist between you. From the tenor, however, of the
deliberation that took place, and from the form of the sentence
which we have mentioned, we believe that for certain those
letters will be entirely revoked, which, although they were
directed to the bishops of the whole of England, still upon the
pretence thereof the said chancellor pronounced you and
many others under the ban of excommunication. With refer-
ence, however, to this denunciation, when, in conformity with
the request of our lord the dean of Rouen, we laid open his
complaint in full consistory before all the cardinals and the
people, on the said letters being read and examined, the pope
protested with the loudest voice possible, in the presence of

here is. It may possibly signify " of letters probably written by you ;"
or it may stand for the Norman legal term " probalium," and allude to
the letters written by the pope to the bishop of Ely, in which case it
would mean, " under the pretext of the pope's letters made public by
him." The latter is most probably the meaning, from the reference to
this letter at the end of the present letter.

all, that the said letters had never originated in his conscience,
while the assemblage of cardinals shouted aloud to the same
effect as regarded themselves in most emphatical terms ; and
when the deputies of the bishop of Ely most urgently ex-
claimed against those statements, he refused to lend an atten-
tive ear to any of them. Farewell."

On the following night the deputies of the bishop of Ely
went to our lord the pope, and censured him, for thus, in the
presence of all the cardinals, protesting that the confirmation
of the sentence which the chancellor had pronounced against
the archbishop of Rouen and his accomplices who had abetted
him in procuring his overthrow, had not proceeded from his
conscience ; and entreated him, for the love of God and the
honor of the Roman Church, to recall to mind the services that
the chancellor had dutifully performed for him and the Church
of Rome, and that, testifying to the truth, he would remove
this opprobrium from the chancellor and his people, in order
that their enemies might not exult at their unjust condemna-
tion.

GUP lord the pope, on being applied to with these exhorta-
tions and others of a like nature, sitting the next day in judg-
ment in presence of the cardinals and all the people, confessed
that those letters which the day before he had on oath dis-
owned had been written by his command, and sent to England
to confirm the sentence of excommunication which the chan-
cellor had pronounced against the archbishop of Rouen and his
accomplices who had expelled him from the kingdom.

In addition to this, the clerks of the archbishop of Rouen
sent word to him that they had conversed four days at Rome
with Hugh de Gurnay, "William de Pessy, Drogo de Tru-
bleville, and many others whom the king of England had
sent to his dominions ; and that fifteen days after, Andrew de
Chavency came to say that the king was much pleased that
the chancellor had been deposed, but that he was also much
displeased that the corporation of London and the whole of
England had been pledged by oath to earl John. The king
also requested that our lord the pope would make null and
void all donations of ecclesiastical revenues which the chancellor
had made after the king's departure ; but our lord the pope
was unwilling so absolutely to nullify those donations, though
he nullified in common all donations of ecclesiastical revenues
that belonged to the king, by whomsoever they had been made,

and on this matter our lord the pope appointed the bishops of
Lincoln and London judges. On the letters being given to the
clerks of our lord the archbishop of Rouen, they came to our
lord the pope, and said to him, alluding to the chancellor,
" Behold how he loved him !" 93

In the same year, our lord the pope sent two cardinals as
legates a latere, namely, Octavianus, bishop of Ostia, and
Jordan de Fossa Nova, to put an end to the dissensions that
existed between the chancellor and the archbishop of Rouen.
On their arrival at Gisors, in Normandy, the gate was shut
against them, and they could not obtain admittance. When
they ascertained that this was done by William FitzRalph,
seneschal of Normandy, they excommunicated him and all
his accomplices and coadjutors, advisers and abettors in the
said piece of presumption, and laid the whole of Normandy
under interdict. On this being told in England, queen
Eleanor and the archbishop of Eouen sent to them Hugh,
bishop of Durham, that they might revoke the sentence they
had pronounced against the seneschal of Normandy and Nor-
mandy itself. At first the bishop of Durham found them at
Paris, after which he followed them to Vezelay, but they would
by no means remit the sentence until they had been received in
Normandy. However, our lord the pope revoked the interdict
placed upon Normandy, and caused it to be revoked by the
legates ; but still they did not enter Normandy.

In the same year, while the seneschal of Gascony lay ill, the
count de Perigord and the viscount de Marke and nearly all
the barons of Gascony, began to ravage the territories of the
king of England ; and in the meantime, the seneschal could
neither obtain peace nor truce, although he frequently, and more
than frequently, requested it. Having at length recovered, he
attacked the castles and fortresses of the said count, and besieged
and took them all, fortifying some on behalf of the king, and
levelling others with the ground. In like manner, he took all the
castles of the said viscount, and reduced the whole of that
county to final subjection to the king. Shortly after, the son
of the king of Navarre came to his assistance with eight hun-
dred knights ; on which, they together entered the territory of
the count of Toulouse, and took many castles in the vicinity of

a:1 St. John xi. 36. This they spitefully and ironically said, in allusion
to the impression entertained by the pope relative to the affection of the
km.g for the bishop of Ely.



278 ANJTALS OF EOGEE DE HOVEDEX. A.D. 1192.

Toulouse, and, after taking them, fortified them in the king's
behalf, and levelled many other fortresses with the ground,
after which they proceeded as far as the gates of Toulouse, and
passed the night almost under its very walls.

In the same year, many pilgrims who had come away with
the king of England from the land of Sulia, returned before the
Nativity of our Lord to England, hoping there to find the king ;
and, on being asked about the king, where he was, they made
answer, " We know not, but his ship on board of which he
embarked, we sawnearing the shore at Brindisi, in Apulia." In
the meantime, Leopold, duke of Austria, who had taken the
king of England, delivered him into the hands of Henry, em-
peror of the Eomans ; in consequence of which, the said emperor
wrote to Philip, king of the Franks, to the following effect :

The Letter of Henry, emperor of the Romans, to Philip, king of
France, in reference to the confinement of Richard, Icing of
England.

11 Henry, by the grace of God, emperor of the Romans and
ever august, to his beloved and especial friend Philip, the illus-
trious king of the Franks, health and sincere love and affection.
Inasmuch as our imperial highness does not doubt that your
royal mightiness will be delighted at all things in which the
omnipotence of the Creator has honored and exalted ourselves
and the Roman empire, we have thought proper to inform
your nobleness by means of these presents, that while the
enemy of our empire and the disturber of your kingdom,
Richard, king of England, was crossing the sea for the pur-
pose of returning to his dominions, it so happened that the
winds brought him, the ship being wrecked on board of which
he was, to the region of Istria, at a place which lies between
Aquileia and Yenice, where, by the sanction of God, the king,
having suffered shipwreck, escaped, together with a few others.
A faithful subject of ours, the count Maynard of Gortze, and the
people of that district, hearing that he was in their territory,
and calling to mind the treason and treachery and accumulated
mischief he had been guilty of in the Land of Promise, pursued
him with the intention of making him prisoner. However, the
king taking to flight, they captured eight knights of his retinue.
Shortly after, the king proceeded to a borough in the arch-
bishopric of Saltzburg, which is called Frisi, where Frederic
de Botesowe took six of his knights, the king hastening on by

night, with only three attendants, in the direction of Austria.
The roads, however, being watched, and guards being set on
every side, our dearly-beloved cousin Leopold, duke of Austria,
captured the king so often mentioned, in an humble house in
a village in the vicinity of Vienna. Inasmuch as he is now
in our power, and has always done his utmost for your
annoyance and disturbance, what we have above stated we
have thought proper to notify to your nobleness, knowing that
the same is well pleasing to your kindly affection for us, and
will afford most abundant joy to your own feelings. Given at
Creutz, 94 on the fifth day before the calends of January."

On these rumours being spread through England as to the
capture of the king of England, Walter, archbishop of Rouen
wrote to Hugh, bishop of Durham, to the following effect :

The Letter of the archlishop of Rouen to tlw bishop of Durham,
relative to the captivity of Richard, Icing of England.

" To his venerable brother in Christ and his most dearly-
beloved friend Hugh, by the grace of God, bishop of Durham,
Walter, by the same grace, archbishop of Rouen, health in all that
is truly healthful. Yarious rumours having been spread abroad
relative to the arrival of the king, at length, as the truth could
110 longer be concealed, everything relative thereto has become
known to us. But, whether in adversity or in prosperity, it be-
hoves us to display equanimity, as we cannot avert the will of
God ; and inasmuch as His judgments are secret, we commend
the fortuitous results of things to His mercy and providence.
With grief of mind are we compelled to confess that it has befallen
the lord our king otherwise than would have been expedient
for his realm and all his faithful subjects ; and if we look more
fully into his meritorious deeds, this misfortune is in no way the
due of his actions. For he, who, for the sake of God exhausted
all his patrimony, and indifferently entrusted the blood of him-
self and of his subjects to the fortune of war, deserved in all
his wanderings to have received the protection of God. But
this adversity, which is so opposed to our good wishes, is a test
of his virtues, and not a mark of censure. And why are we
obliged to say more than we could have wished ? We have
thought proper to transmit to you a copy of a letter of the em-

a misprint for " Risceusis."



280 ANNALS OF IIOGEK DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1192.

peror of Germany which he has sent to the king of the Franks,
relative to the capture of our lord the king of England, folded
within this present page. Now, there is need not of your tears
but of your promptness, as we must not meet the attacks of
fortune with lamentations, but, concealing our sorrow, must
endeavour to make trial of our prowess ; perhaps ' Weeping
may endure for a night, but joy will come to us in the morn-
ing.' 95 And inasmuch as, next to the mercy of God, the great-
est portion of our hope is reposed in your bosom, with a breast
bedewed with tears, and with our entire heart, we do suppliantly,
devotedly, and as being most dear to you, entreat you that in
this trouble which, thus momentous beyond all conception, has
befallen our lord the king, you will with all your energies act
the part of diligence and of circumspection, and that, through no
consideration of difficulty, no prospect of adversity, no pretext,
no consideration of temporal benefits or of your own welfare, you
will refuse to us and to our lord, or rather to yourself, your
counsel, which with all our bowels we are longing to receive.
And whereat the mind is more fully opened to one present
than to a person when absent, and in the presence of persons
counsel under present difficulties will shine forth with greater
effulgence, and the Lord will bestow on the same a more
healthful effect, we do consequently beg of you, tearfully and
with all the affection before expressed, all excuse as to difficul-
ties laid aside, to meet us and other faithful servants of our
lord the king at Oxford, on the Lord's day before ' Latare
Jerusalem ' % is sung. For the present matter requires that
degree of prompt attention, that all excuses whatsoever should
be laid aside ; and it is our belief that the love which is due to
our lord the king, should, in the case of which we speak, be
fully made proof of. You must also know that the lord bishop
of Bath has already had several interviews with our lord the
emperor, on the subject of setting our king at liberty ; for he is
using every labour and exertion to show him all due obe-
dience, and to pay that homage which is due from his respect for
the crown, acceptable to the king's honor, and as advantageous
under present circumstances, as it has also been on other occa-
sions ; this we have learned from those persons who were pre-
sent at the interview which the lord bishop of Bath had with

our lord the prince respecting the liberation of our master.
And whereas, under all circumstances, the Divine aid of God
ought to be implored, we beg that throughout the whole of
your diocese you will cause prayers to be put up for him to the
Most High. ' The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man
availeth much/ 97 and the importunate woman in the Gospel
was deemed deserving to be heard, and, as it is there said,
Christ raised her son, because for him many tears were shed.
Farewell."

Accordingly, upon hearing of the confinement of the king,
Walter, archbishop of Eouen, and the other justiciaries of our
lord the king, sent the abbat of Boxley and the abbat of Pont
Robert to Germany, to seek the king of England. After
having passed through the whole of Germany, and not find-
ing the king, they entered Bavaria, and met the king at a
town, the name of which is Oxefer, where he was brought
before the emperor, to hold a conference with him, on Palm
Sunday. On hearing that the before-named abbats had come
from England, the king showed himself courteous and affable
to them ; making enquiries about the state of his kingdom
and the fidelity of his subjects, and the health and prosperity
of the king of Scotland, in whose fidelity he placed a very
strong reliance : on which they testified to what they had
heard and seen. A conference accordingly taking place be-
tween them, the king made complaint of the treachery of his
brother, John, earl of Mortaigne, on whom he had conferred so
many favours and boundless honors, and who had thrown him-
self into the hands of the king of France against him, and,
having broken the ties of brotherhood, had made a league with
death and a compact with hell. The king, though greatly
afflicted upon this subject, suddenly broke forth into these
words of consolation, saying, " My brother John is not the
man to subjugate a country, if there is a person able to make
the slightest resistance to his attempts."

During his journey of three days, while on the road to meet
the emperor, it was the admiration of all, how boldly, how
courteously, and how becomingly he behaved himself, and they
judged him worthy of the imperial elevation who so thoroughly
understood the arts of command, and how, with uniform sell-
possession, to rise superior to the two-faced events of fortune.
On a day named, after he had held a conference by messen-
gers with the emperor, they were unable on that day to have an
^ James v. 16.



282 ANNALS OF KOGEE DE HOVEDEX. A.D. 1192.

inter\iew with him, because the emperor had made of him
many demands, to which the king had determined not to yield,
even though his life should be perilled thereby. On the mor-
row, however, while all were despairing, with joyous success
ensued joyous consolation.

For, on the emperor accusing the king of many things, and
charging him with many misdeeds, both with his betrayal of the
land of Sulia, and with the death of the marquis of Montferrat, as
also with reference to certain covenants made between them and
not observed by him, the king made answer with such frank-
ness, such self-possession, and such intrepidity, that the em-
peror thought him worthy not only of his favour and pardon,
but even of his praise. For he raised the king when bending
before him, and received him with the kiss of peace, and made
a treaty of friendship with him, and, loading him with honors
and succour (the people standing around and bursting into
tears for very joy), made a promise that he would reconcile
the king of England with the king of France. After this,
with the mediation of the duke of Austria, the king of Eng-
land promised that he would pay to the emperor for his libe-
ration, by way of ransom, one hundred thousand marks. The
emperor also promised that, if by his means the king of Eng-
land and the king of France could not be reconciled, he would
send the king of England home without exacting the money.

In the same year, pope Celestinus, thinking that the king
of France and the earl of Mortaigne, the brother of the king
of England, were waging war against the king of England,
wrote to the bishops of England to the following effect :

The Letter of pope Celestinus to the archbishops and bishops
of England.

" Celestinus, the bishop, servant of the servants of God, to
his venerable brethren, the archbishops and bishops throughout
England appointed, health, and the Apostolic benediction.
"Whereas, for the purpose of repelling the injuries done to the
people of Christendom, and wiping away that stain to our
common faith which the pollutions of the pagans, in the cap-
ture of the Holy Land, which has been named the inheritance
of the Lord, had perniciously and violently imprinted thereon,
and for cleansing the Holy City and the Sepulchre of our Lord
from the abominations of the Saracens and others, who held
possession thereof, as also for the purpose, with the assistance



A.D. 1192. LETTES OF POPE CELESTINUS. 283

of the Divine mercy, of rescuing it from their power, the
Apostolic See, remembering what was its bounden duty, sent
its nuncios to different parts of the world, and letters of admo-
nition, and, putting its trust in the Divine clemency, granted
great indulgences to those proceeding thither; although, as
your brotherhood may have perceived, to do this at its exhor-
tations, very many manfully and duteously devoted themselves,
and oftentimes, in parts beyond sea, so many of the faithful ones
of Christ were for this purpose assembled together, that their
multitude seemed in no slight degree to exceed the numbers of
their antagonists, and also to be superior in resources and
strength, they were still unable to effect much, or to make head
against those who were fighting against them, because (as
one may perceive from the result) the attempts and the actions
of those who had set out for those parts were, in a great
measure, displeasing unto the Lord. Wherefore, on the ground
of their other offences, because they trusted not in God but in
their own strength, and the fear of God was not before their
eyes, by reason of their preconceived vanity, their heart was
allowed to be darkened, that so they might do other things as
well, which were by no means befitting, thus provoking against
themselves, by their perversity, the Divine vengeance. But,
inasmuch as the mercies of the Lord are manifold, although,
in order to bend the refractoriness of the wicked, and to
bow the necks of stiff-necked men, for the purposes of cor-
rection He makes heavy the weight of his hand in admi-
nistering discipline, and depresses that He may raise, and
smites or scourges that He may heal, if, with due humility
we return "unto Him, fully chastened for our sins, and if
we resolutely make it our purpose with more fervent zeal to
observe for the future the commands of our Creator, we may
then, without any hesitation, conceive hopes that He will
more abundantly and more graciously assist us, and will, with
His indulgence, grant us from heaven a full victory over the
enemies of Christ ; so much so, that all the grievances which
we have hitherto suffered may be committed to oblivion,
all those being turned back, and falling with deserved confusion,
who hate Zion, and have presumed to defile her with the pol-
lutions of the heathen. When we consider, however, and
examine the matter with diligence and earnestness, what was
the nature of the threats which the Divine power pronounced
against the people of Israel, when, according to promise, they



284 ANNALS OF EOGER DE HOVEDEX. A. D. 1192.

entered the land above-mentioned, there cannot be a particle
of doubt to present itself in this our examination why it is that
our attempts thus begun on behalf of God have not been
crowned with the hoped-for success. For they were told to
abstain from the impurities and filthiness of the inhabitants of
that land, and not to deem their vices worthy of imitation,
which might redound to the ruin of themselves, but to observe
the law of the Lord with firmness of purpose and with every
effort of zeal and earnestness ; and that, if they should dute-
ously and humbly obey these admonitions, one of them should
conquer a thousand, and ten of them ten thousand. And this
they shortly after became sensible of from a more assured ex-
perience, inasmuch as a few of them slew a vast and almost
infinite multitude of their enemies ; and, so long as they
dutifully obeyed the Divine commands, there was not a city or
a fortified place that was able to withstand their attacks, or by
any resources or counsels to be rescued from becoming subject
to their power. And yet, when their sons, who, as it is there
said, ' knew not the Lord,' had, in their rashness, begun to fall
away from the observance of those things which in the promul-
gation of the law had been enjoined them, then did their foes,
rallying their forces against them, often subject them to their
power ; whom once again, by the Divine aid, they conquered,
when, being penitent for the excesses committed by them, and ac-
knowledging their guilt, with pious devotion they numbly turned
to God. And you may know beyond a doubt, that it was in con-
sequence of the discords that arose, that the achievement of the
hoped-for victory was taken away from the Christian chivalry
by reason of the quarrels and frequent rancours that liad sprung
up in the army, and because they had made the flesh their arm,
and had withdrawn their hearts from the Lord. If, then, it is
our wish without great labour to obtain a glorious triumph in
all things, with the downfall of our adversaries, let us not faint
in spirit by reason of the grievances hitherto endured ; but, with
all humility and contrition of heart, seeking the mercy of the
Creator, to their lasting confusion we shall be enabled to hope
agreeably to our deserts for a complete victory, in reliance upon
the accustomed beneficence of the supreme mercy. Induced,
therefore, by this consideration, we have entreated all the princes
of the world, for the remission of their sins, that, out of regard
for the Divine love and their own salvation, if any one has on



A.D. 1192. LETTER OF POPE CELESTIXUS. 285

any ground entertained feelings of rancour against another, and
has despised the advice of man, he will for the Creator do
away with the same ; lest grounds for mutual dissension
may still exist, which have hitherto, as you are well aware,
deprived us of the achievement of victory, and have, without
any advantage, brought the greater part of this multitude into
peril of death. And, among themselves, let them make it their
care, with all earnestness of mind, to consider the means by
which, in the meantime, that little of the land, the portion of the
Lord, which is still held under the sway of the Christians,
may be yet preserved unshaken, and without any fear defended
against the attacks of the wicked, that so it may not fall into
the hands of the unbelievers ; and that, lastly, a multitude of
the faithful may put themselves in readiness, who may with
all due and duteous humility proceed thither, and, conquering
and utterly treading under foot the frantic might of those in
possession thereof, liberate the land and the Sepulchre of the
Lord. And further, inasmuch as there hence arises too abun-
dant cause for tearfulness to ourselves and all Christian people,
and we are bound in every way to be sorrowful and not to
rejoice, so long as the land, on which have stood the feet of the
Lord and where the sacraments of our salvation were revealed,
is held in the occupation of the Gentiles, we do utterly forbid
tournaments, which were invented for the sake of mirthfulness
and for the exercise of the prowess of novices in the art of war,
to the end that he who wishes to exercise himself may repair to
that land, where the prowess of his mind and his body may
both manfully and healthfully be proved. Let them also so
make it their care to maintain unity, peace, and concord one
with another, that there may be no one to wage war against
another, or to presume to avenge an injury with arms, but rather
let them make it their common study, what means may, through
zeal and diligent attention, soothe all conflicting spirits. But
if any one, a thing we do not believe, laying aside all fear of
God and respect for ourselves, and through contempt for the
Christian faith, shall with any rashness presume to act con-
trary hereto, then let him know that we do strictly command
yourselves and the other archbishops and bishops to place under
ecclesiastical interdict the lands of such persons as shall think
proper contumaciously to follow a course of this kind, as also,
if there shall be a necessity, to place under the ban of excommu-
nication their persons as well, and to cause both sentences to be



286 ANNALS OF ROGER DE HOYEPEN. A.D. 1193.

inviolably observed. We do therefore by these Apostolic wri-
tings strictly enjoin and command you, that you will prepare
yourselves with all haste to fulfil what we have above men-
tioned, all tardiness and hesitation laid aside, and will make it
your endeavour throughout your dioceses, no delay or appeal
being allowed, to put the same into execution. Given at St.
Peter's, at Eome, on the third day before the ides of January,
in the second year of our pontificate."

Richard, king of England, being still detained in captivity
by Henry, emperor of the Romans, in order that he might
escape from this captivity, by the advice of Eleanor, his mother,
abdicated the throne of the kingdom of England, and delivered
it to the emperor as the lord of all, and with his cap invested
him therewith. However, the emperor, as had been pre-
arranged, immediately restored to him, in the presence of the
nobles of Germany and England, the said kingdom of England,
to hold the same of him for five thousand pounds sterling,
yearly, payable as tribute; and the emperor invested him
therewith, with a double cross of gold. However, the said
emperor, at his death, released Richard, king of England, and
his heirs from these and all other covenants whatsoever.

In the year of grace 1193, being the fourth year of the reign
of Richard, king of England, Philip, king of France, was in
France on the day of the Nativity of our Lord, being the sixth
day of the week, in great sorrow and confusion, because the
seneschal of Normandy refused to deliver up to him his sister
Alice ; he also frequently sent messengers to England, to John
earl of Mortaigne, the king's brother, telling him how the king
was detained in captivity, and would never escape from the
custody of the emperor of Germany; adding, that if he would
acquiesce in his wishes and designs, he would give him his sister
Alice in marriage, and restore to him Normandy, Aquitaine,
andAnjou, and all the other territories beyond sea, that his
father, Henry, king of England, had ever possessed, and would
secure for him the kingdom of England ; lor Richard, the king
of England, was still kept in confinement by the emperor of
Germany.

Upon this, immediately after the Nativity of our Lord,
John, earl of Mortaigne, the king's brother, crossed over to
Normandy, upon whose arrival the seneschal of Normandy,
and other faithful subjects of the king of England, went to meet
him, and requested that he would come with them to a con-

ference at Alencon, to treat on the affairs of the king and his
liberation. To this he made answer, "If you will receive me
as your lord, and swear fealty to me, I will come with you
and will be your defender against the king of France ; but if
not, I will not come to you." On hearing this, the nobles of
Normandy refused to obey him, or to swear fealty, trusting
that by the help of God, their lord, the king of England, would
return safe and sound.

"Upon this, John, the king's brother, repaired to the king of
France and did homage to him for Normandy, and for the
other territories of his brother beyond sea, and for England as
well, as some said. He also made oath that he would marry his
sister Alice, and released to the king of France all claims upon
Gisors and the whole of the Yexin, in Normandy ; on which
the king of France gave to him, with his said sister, that part
of Flanders which belonged to him, and swore to him that he
would, to the utmost of his ability, assist in gaining England
and the other territories of the king of England on his behalf.
After this, the said earl of Mortaigne returned to England,
bringing many foreigners with him ; immediately on which,
the castles of Wallingford and "Windsor were surrendered to
him. The earl next came to London, and demanded of the
archbishop of Rouen and the other justiciaries of England the
kingdom, and the fealty of the subjects of the realm, assert-
ing that the king of England, his brother, was dead. However,
they did not place any confidence in his words.

On this, being repulsed by the justiciaries and the other
nobles of the kingdom, he withdrew, and, excited by indigna-
tion, fortified his castles and fortresses, and in his hostility in-
vaded the lands of the king, his brother. Accordingly, multi-
tudes resorted to him, deceiving themselves j on which, being
scourged by the deserved retribution of God, they lost everything
that they possessed. For the justiciaries of England and the faith-
ful subjects of our lord the king manfully resisted the said earl of
Mortaigne, and inflicted upon him much loss; they also strength-
ened with garrisons the seaports and all the maritime places, with
such care, that the Franks and Flemings, and many others, who
had promised their aid to the before-named earl, * did not dare
to land in England. Some, however, of their number who did
land in England, were taken prisoners and placed in chains.

The king of France, also, unmindful of the oath which on his
departure from the land of Sulia he had made to the king of



288 ANNALS OF EOGEft DE HOYEDEN. A.D. 1193.

England, as to maintaining peace, entered Normandy in a hostile
manner, and ravaged the king's territories with fire, and carried
off much spoil. However, Robert, earl of Leicester, who had
shortly before returned from the land of Sulia, and the other
nobles of Normandy, made a stout resistance against him.

In the meantime, the above-named abbats of Boxley, and of
Pont Robert, whom the justiciaries of England had sent in
search of the king, returned to England after Easter, inform-
ing them that peace had been made between the emperor and
the king of England, on the day of the Supper of our Lord,
upon the following terms : " The king of England shall give
to the emperor of the Romans one hundred thousand silver
marks as his ransom, and shall find fifty galleys, with all
their equipments, and twenty knights for his service for one
year :" and stated that they themselves were present at- the
said treaty.

After this treaty had been made, there arrived envoys from
the king of France, who, on his behalf, defied our lord the
king. To them the emperor immediately made answer, that
whoever should molest the king of England would also offend
the emperor himself; such great love and lasting concord had
been established between them. And because the king of Eng-
land made offer to obey the demands of justice in the court of
his lord the king of France, as to all matters with which the
king of France or any other person of his party might charge
him, the emperor attempted to have a conference held between
him and the king of France, but it was not proceeded with.
The king of England, on this, sent to England for ships, and
for Alan Trenchemere, the pilot of his own ship, as also for
hostages to be given to the emperor as a security for his per-
formance of the treaty made between them. These commands
he gave, and they were all complied with ; after which, Ro-
bert de Turnham, one of the king's household, came to Lon-
don, being sent to England with the king's armour.

Upon this, all the principal men of the kingdom met to-
gether, and laid siege to Windsor, the castle of the earl
of Mortaigne. Geoffre} r , archbishop of York, Hugh Bar-
dolph, the king's justiciary, the sheriff of York, and William
de Stuteville, assembling their forces, came to Doncaster, and
fortified it. But when the archbishop of York wished to
proceed thence, and lay siege to Tickhill, a castle belonging to
the earl of Mortaigne, Hugh Bardolph and William de Stute-



A.D. 1193. TKUCE WITH THE EARL OF MOBTAIGNE. 289

ville would not agree thereto, because they were liegemen of
earl John ; on which the archbishop of York left them, with his
people, calling them traitors to the king and his realm.

In the meantime, the king of France, with a strong hand,
entered Normandy, and laid siege to Gisors ; on which Gilbert
de Guascoil, who had charge of the castle of Gisors and the
castle of Nefle, surrendered them both to the king of France,
and became his adherent. However, he was despised among
them for the treason he had been guilty of to his master the
king of England, who had, in the fulness of his favour, sent
him from Messina to take charge of the said castles. After
this, the king of France came to Rouen, and said to the inha-
bitants of that place : " John, earl of Mortaigne, has done
homage to me for England, and has given up to me Normandy
and all other lands on this side the sea ; and I have come hither
to take possession of this city, which is the capital of the
whole of Normandy ; allow me to enter peaceably, and I will
prove a kind and just master to you."

To this they made answer : " See, the gates are open ;
enter if you like ; no one opposes you." On which the king
replied: " I will speak to my people about it;" and then,
after consulting his people on the matter, declined to enter.
Accordingly, the king of France being thus deceived in his
hopes, retired from Rouen with his army, and burned his stone-
engines, twenty-four in number, which he had posted around
the city: he also broke his wine-casks, and having poured
forth all the wine, took his departure, sending word to the
citizens that he would visit them with a rod of iron.

The king of England still remaining in the custody of the
emperor of the Romans, all people were surprised at his thus
delaying ; and some, in consequence of the predictions of the
earl of Mortaigne, who always predicted that he would never
return, doubted about him and his ever returning. In con-
sequence of this, Walter, archbishop of Rouen, and the other
justiciaries of England, although they had compelled the earl
of Mortaigne to surrender, and had nearly taken his castle of
Windsor, to which they had been laying siege, made a truce
with the earl of Mortaigne until the feast of All Saints, the
castles of Nottingham and Tickhill remaining in the charge of
the earl, as before. But the castles of AVindsor, and of Wal-
lingford, and of the Peak, were given into the hands of queen
Eleanor, the mother of the said earl of Mortaigne, and of some

other custodians, who were to deliver them into fris hands if
the king, his brother, should not come in the meantime. "When
Hugh, bishop of Durham, who had in the meantime been
laying siege to the castle of Tickhill, heard of this, he was
greatly vexed, as he now felt sure of taking it ; but, by the
command of the said justiciaries, he took his departure, leav-
ing his task incomplete.

Shortly after this, there came messengers to England with
letters from the king, addressed by him to all the archbishops,
bishops, abbats, earls, barons, clerks, and freeholders ; and by
them the king humbly entreated that all persons, both clergy
as well as laity, would give such assistance in ransoming him
as should secure his grateful thanks to them ; and, in order that
they might do this with the more full assurance, the emperor
of the Romans wrote in general terms to all the subjects of
the king of England, informing them that their lord the king
of England had come to an agreement with him as to the sum
to be paid for his ransom ; but he did not state the amount of
the sum. Our lord the pope Celestinus also wrote in like man-
ner, in behalf of the king, to all the ecclesiastics of the king-
dom of England, to the effect that the emperor and the whole
of liis empire would be placed under interdict unless the king
of England were speedily liberated from his custody. He like-
wise issued a command that the king of France and his king-
dom should be laid under interdict unless he should desist
from persecuting the king of England, so long as he remained
in the emperor's hands. Moved by these and other admoni-
tions of our lord the pope, and the whole of the cardinals, and
the advice of prudent men, the Roman emperor and the king
of England became reconciled : on which the king of England
wrote to his faithful servants throughout England, to the fol-
lowing effect :

Tlie Letter of Richard, king of England, to queen Eleanor, his
another, and his justiciaries in England.

"Richard, by the grace of God, king of England, duke of
Normandy and Aquitaine, and earl of Anjou, to Eleanor, by
the same grace, queen of England, his much-loved mother, and
to his justices, and all his faithful servants throughout Eng-
land, greeting. Be it known unto you all, that, after our be-
loved servants, the venerable Hubert, bishop of Salisbury, and
William, of the Church of Saint Mary, our prothonotary, had

departed from us, our most dearly beloved chancellor, "William,
bishop of Ely, came to us, and, he faithfully negociating be-
tween our lord the emperor and. ourselves, the result was, that
we came from the castle of Trevelles, in which we were con-
fined, to meet the emperor at Haguenau, where we were ho-
norably received by the emperor and the whole of his court.
Here, too, our lord the emperor and our lady the empress
honored us with many and various presents, and, what is of
especial importance, a mutual and indissoluble bond of friend-
ship was formed between our lord the emperor and ourselves ;
whereby each of us is bound to aid the other against all living
men in gaining his rights and in retaining possession of the
same. For becoming reasons it is that we are prolonging our
stay with the emperor, until his business and our own shall be
brought to an end, and until we shall have paid him seventy
thousand marks of silver. "Wherefore we do beg of you, and
by the fealty by which you are bound to us, do adjure you,
that you will use all earnestness in raising the said sum of
money, and that you, our justiciaries, who are placed above the
others in our kingdom, will set an example to others ; that
so you may honorably and nobly afford of your own means for
our assistance, and also raise what you can on loan from
others, in order that you may set an example to our other faith-
ful subj ects for doing the like . The whole of the gold and silver,
also, of the churches, you are with careful attention, and with
a written inventory, to receive from the prelates of those
churches ; and you are to assure them by your oath, and by that
of such others of our barons as you shall think fit, that full res-
titution shall be made for the same. You are also to receive
hostages from all our barons, in order that when our most trusty
chancellor, as soon as our business has been settled in Germany,
shall come to England, he may find the same hostages with our
much-beloved mother, that so he may with all expedition
transmit to us such of them as may have been agreed upon
between ourselves and the emperor ; to the end that our libe-
ration may not suffer any delay in consequence of the absence of
the hostages and your neglect. Also, money there collected is,
in like manner, to be delivered to our mother and such persons
as she shall think proper. He whom, in the moment of our
necessity, we shall find to be prompt, in his necessity will find
us a friend, and ready to reward ; and it will be more pleasing
to us if, in our absence, any person shall in any way assist us,

than if, in our presence, hie should give us twice that amount
of aid. We do also desire that the names of each of the nobles,
and their subsidies which shall be made on the present occasion,
shall be signified unto us under the seal of our mother, that we
may know how far we are bound to return thanks to each.
Know for certain that, if we were now in England, free and at
our own disposal, we would give as great or a greater sum of
money to our lord the emperor than we now give for obtain-
ing the terms which, by the grace of God, we have gained :
and, moreover, if we had not such sum of money in our posses-
sion, we would deliver up to the emperor our own body until
the said money should be paid, rather than that which has
been agreed upon should be left incomplete. Under the golden
bulla of our lord the emperor, our chancellor brings to you
the attestation above-mentioned. Witness ourselves, at Ha-
guenau, the thirteenth day before the calends of May."

Accordingly, upon the authority of this letter the king's
mother and the justiciaries of England determined that all
the clergy as well as the laity ought to give the fourth part
of the present year's revenue for the ransom of our lord the
king, and to add as much from their chattel property, whereby
the king would be bound to know whom he had to thank.
They also exacted from each knight's fee twenty shillings,
and from the abbeys of the Cistercian order and the houses
of the order of Sempringham the whole of their wool for the
current year, and the whole of the gold and silver of the
churches, as the king by his mandate had directed. After
this, his said chancellor came to England on behalf of our
lord the king, bringing a letter from his lordship the em-
peror, ratified by the golden bulla, and to the following effect :

The Letter of the emperor Henry to the nobles of England, on
behalf of king Richard.

"Henry, by the grace of God, emperor of the Romans and
ever august, to his loving friends the archbishops, bishops,
earls, barons, nobles, and all persons throughout England to
whom this present page shall come, greeting and good will.
We have deemed it proper and reflecting credit upon our high
estate, most earnestly to engage the whole of you in every way
that we possibly can, to take those steps which are due to the
honor of our most dearly beloved friend your lord Eichard,
king of England, to the end that the constancy of your dutiful

attachment, and the merits of your fidelity, may not seem to be
dead as regards his advantage, but rather may appear to live in
obedience to himself and to his rule. Wherefore to all whose
duty shall be proved to be sincere and pure to their said king
in his absence, we shall return most abundant thanksgivings,
wishing it to come to the knowledge of you all that his
imperial highness is upon terms of concord and lasting peace
with his royal nobleness. "Wherefore, whatever shall be said
to his disparagement, will be productive of annoyance and in-
convenience to ourselves equally with him. Accordingly, to
the honor and advantage of his duteous and faithful subjects,
and to the condemnation and uprooting of those who molest
him, we will always give our zealous assistance ; and, because
in heart and soul we are united, shall always folly consider
the acts of your king to be especially our own and those of our
empire, and shall look upon injuries done to him as offered to
ourselves and to our imperial crown ; nor, with the will of God,
will we pass over the same without vengeance and the heavy
punishment and destruction of those who have been guilty of
the same. Given at Haguenau, on the thirteenth day before
the calends of May."

After this treaty of peace was made between the emperor
and the king of England, the emperor proposed an interview
between him and the king of France, for the purpose of effect-
ing a reconciliation between him and the king of England,
through the mediation of William, archbishop of Bheims,
uncle of the king of France, and a kinsman of the king of
England ; on which they appointed a day for an interview on
the morrow of the Nativity of Saint John the Baptist, being
the sixth day of the week, between Vaucouleurs and Toul.

The king's chancellor, on his arrival in England, went to
Saint Alban's with great humility, where our lady the queen,
the king's mother, with the lord archbishop of Rouen, and the
other justiciaries of our lord the king, met him. There also
the said chancellor gave to the justices the golden bulla of the
emperor, containing the indissoluble treaty made between his
lordship the emperor with our lord the king, asserting that
neither as justiciary, legate, nor chancellor, but as a simple
bishop, he had come to England ; not as a dweller therein, but
as a stranger ; indeed, as a messenger only from our lord the
king. He also enjoined certain of the barons to accompany
him to the king, namely, Gilbert, bishop of Rochester, Sefrid,



294 ANNALS OF B.OGER DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1193.

bishop of Chichester, Benedict, abbat of Burgh, Richard, earl
of Clare, earl Roger Bigot, Geoffrey de Say, and several others.

Here, also, it was arranged in whose hands the money,
when collected, was to be placed, namely, in the charge of
Hubert Fitz- Walter, archbishop elect of Canterbury, the lord
bishop of London, William, earl of Arundel, Hamelin, earl of
Warenne, and the mayor of London, under the seal of our
lady the queen, and the seal of the lord archbishop of Rouen.
Here it may be remarked, that after the arrival of Hubert
Fitz- Walter, bishop of Salisbury, in England, the monks of the
metropolitan church of Canterbury met together, and elected
as their archbishop the said Hubert, bishop of Salisbury.
Against this election Hubert, archdeacon of Canterbury, ap-
pealed to the Supreme Pontiff, both because the king was in
confinement, as also because the bishops of England, whose
duty it was to be present at the election, were not present at
that election.

In the same year, while the king of England was in the
custody of the emperor, Saladin departed this life in the first
week of Lent ; upon which occasion the duke of Yenice wrote
'to the said king of England to the following effect :

The Letter of Dandolo, duke of Venice, Dalmatia, and Cherum, 9 *
to Richard, king of England, on the death of Saladin.

" To his most serene lord Richard, by the grace of God,
king of England, duke of Normandy and Aquitaine, and earl
of Anjou, Henry Dandolo, by the same grace, duke of Venice,
Dalmatia, and Cherum, health, and sincere and duteous affec-
tion. Know ye that it has been intimated to us from a source
that can be relied on, that Saladin, that enemy of the Christian
religion, is dead : and one of his sons, whom he is said to have
appointed heir to the whole of his dominions, is at present in
Damascus, while the other one is ruling at Babylon" and
Alexandria. His brother is in the vicinity of Babylon with
a numerous army, and the greatest dissension exists between
them. Farewell."

In the meanwhile, as the time approached for the interview
between the emperor and the king of France, the king of Eng-
land found, through other signs, that if this interview should
take place, the emperor and the king of France would form a
confederacy against the archbishops of Cologne and Mentz,

98 Probably a misprint for Croatia. " In Egypt ; the seat of the

and the dukes of Louvain, Lemberg, and Saxony, and many
other chieftains and nobles who had conspired against the em-
peror, on account of the death of the bishop of Liege, brother of
the duke of Louvain, which had been contrived by the emperor.
The king of England was also apprehensive that if this confer-
ence should take place, he himself would without doubt be
delivered into the hands of the king of France. Consequently,
the king exerted himself to the utmost of his power that the
conference might be broken off, and that peace should be made
between the emperor and the said nobles.

Accordingly, at his urgent entreaty, the emperor and the
said nobles concluded between themselves a treaty of peace
and reconciliation to the following effect : The emperor caused
a great number of bishops, earls, and barons to make oath upon
his own soul that he had neither commanded nor wished that
the said bishop of Liege should be put to death, and that when
he knew it, he was greatly grieved thereat ; and, by way of
satisfying them, he restored to every one of the persons afore-
said, who had conspired against him, all the castles that his
father or he himself had taken from them ; on which they be-
came reconciled, with the sole exception of the duke of Saxony.
The interview, also, which was to have taken place between
him and the king of France at Vaucouleurs was broken off, and
did not take place.

These matters being thus arranged, on the Friday next after
the feast of the Nativity of Saint John the Baptist, the empe-
ror came to Worms, where our lord the king of England then
was. Here a conference was held between them for four days,
at which were present the bishops of those parts, the dukes of
Louvain and of Lemberg, and many earls and barons. Of
the king of England's party, there were present the bishops of
Bath and Ely ; and on the fourth day, which was the vigil of
the Apostles Saint Peter and Saint Paul, there came to the king
of England William Bruyere and Baldwin de Brun ; for as yet
all quite despaired of the liberation of the king of Eng-
land. But, by the mercy of God, on the day of the Apostles
Saint Peter and Saint Paul, matters were finally arranged be-
tween the emperor and the king in the following manner:
"Our lord the king will pay to the emperor one hundred
thousand marks of pure silver, Cologne weight, and another
fifty thousand marks of silver, instead of the assistance which
he was to have given the emperor in regaining Apulia. Also,
the king will give the sister of Arthur, duke of Brittany, his



296 ANNALS OF HOGER DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1193.

nephew, in marriage to the son of the duke of Austria,
and will set at liberty the emperor of Cyprus, but without
restoring to him his empire ; and, in like manner, will libe-
rate the daughter of that emperor, whom he will cause to
be delivered up to the duke of Austria, as being her uncle.
The said hundred thousand marks, our lord the king is to
bring at his own risk to the borders of the empire, and so soon
as they shall have entered any part of the empire, our lord the
king shall freely and quietly return with a safe conduct to Eng-
land." To this, the bishops, dukes, earls, and all nobles who
were then present made oath upon the soul of the emperor :
on which, the agreement was reduced to writing, as made be-
tween the emperor and the king of England to the following
effect : -

The form of the agreement made between the emperor Henry, and
Richard, Icing of England,.

" In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the
Holy Ghost, Amen. This is the form of the agreement made
between our lord the emperor, ever august, and our lord
Richard, the illustrious king of England. Our lord the em-
peror shall send his messengers with the messengers of the
king of England, who shall proceed to London, and there re-
ceive one hundred thousand marks of pure silver, Cologne
weight ; which money, on being received by the messengers of
the emperor, and duly weighed, shall be sealed in the presence
of his messengers, and shall be escorted under the king's
charge through the territories of his kingdom ; so that if it
shall chance to be lost in his kingdom, it shall be so lost at the
said king's risk. After the said money shall have come to the
borders of the empire, it shall be handed over by the messengers
of the king to the messengers of our lord the emperor, who
shall immediately there receive it, and if it shall happen to be
lost within the territories of the empire, it shall be so lost at
the risk of the emperor, and the king shall not be damnified,
nor yet his hostages, thereby. The king shall also give ano-
ther fifty thousand marks of silver to the emperor and the duke
of Austria, and shall give hostages for the same, namely, to
our lord the emperor, sixty hostages for thirty thousand marks,
and to the duke of Austria, seven hostages for twenty thousand
marks. And when the hundred thousand marks shall have
been paid and the hostages given, the king shall be at liberty






A.T5. 1193. PEACE MADE WITH THE KING OP FRANCE. 297

to depart. But if our lord the king shall keep the promise
which he has made to our lord the emperor as to Henry, the
former duke of Saxony, the emperor will then release and dis-
charge the king from payment of the said fifty thousand marks,
and, for the king, will give to the duke of Austria twenty
thousand marks ; and the king shall not he bound to give to
the duke of Austria the seven hostages, or to the emperor the
sixty. When, therefore, the king shall have fulfilled his
aforesaid promise as to Henry, the former duke of Saxony, and
shall have paid the said hundred thousand marks, he shall be
at liberty to depart. Moreover, the king has caused oath to be
made upon his soul, that he will deliver his niece, the daughter
of the duke of Brittany, in marriage to the son of the duke of
Austria, within seven months after he shall have been set at
liberty, and shall have returned into his own territory, and
will send her to the entrance of the empire, if they shall
think fit to Deceive her; and if they shall not, he shall be re-
leased therefrom. Also, if the promise as to Henry, the for-
mer duke of Saxony, shall not be fulfilled, the fifty thousand
marks, remaining unpaid, shall be paid within seven months
after he shall have been set at liberty, and shall have returned
to his territory. When the king shall have been set at liberty,
and shall wish to return, the emperor shall give him a safe
conduct through his dominions to the limits of his empire,
and in the harbour where he shall embark, so long as he shall
there remain, and until he shall depart with a fair wind. More-
over, all things, both in these as also in other familiar letters,
sealed with the emperor's seal, with reference to the contracts
that have been made between them, each according to his own
ability, will ratify and confirm, and will with good faith ob-
serve."

When the king of France heard of this, he immediately
sent word to earl John that he must take care of himself, for the
devil was now let loose. Accordingly, earl John, understanding
that this was said in reference to the king, his brother, imme-
diately crossed over from England to Normandy, and became
an adherent of the king of France, not daring to await the
arrival of the king, his brother, in England. After this, the
king of England sent William, bishop of Ely, his chancellor, and
William Bruyere, and other discreet men to make peace on
some terms or other with the king of France ; who accordingly
made a treaty of peace with him to the following effect :



298 ATTffALS OF XQGEB, DE HOYEDEff. A.D. 1193.

The Form of the Treaty of Peace made between the Icings of
France and England.

" Know all men to whom these present letters shall come,
that "William, chancellor of Richard, king of England, hishop
of Ely, and legate of the Apostolic See, and, with him,
"William de Roches, John de Pratelles, and William Bruyere,
have come to the king of France, on behalf of the king of
England, with letters patent to the said king, in which it is
stated that such terms as they shall agree to and conclude
with him, the said king of England will fully ratify and con-
firm. Wherefore they have agreed to the following effect, and
have, on behalf of their lord the king of England, made the
following covenants with the king of France. Richard, king
of England, agrees with his liege lord, the king of France, as
to the whole of the land which the king of France has taken
from him and his subjects, and which is held by himself and
his subjects, that he shall retain as much of the same as he
shall think fit for himself and his people. And, as to earl
John, the following shall be the terms agreed to. If the men
of the king of England shall be able fully to make proof in
the court of our lord the king of France that the said John
has sworn to obtain money for the liberation of the king of Eng-
land, and has made agreement to that effect, then the said John
shall be held bound to pay the same ; also, the whole of the
lands which he held, when the king of England, his brother,
took his departure to go beyond sea, he shall hold, on both
sides of the sea, as freely as he previously held the same ; ex-
cepted always, that he shall be released from the oath which
he made as to not entering the territory of England ; and, on
this point, the said king of England shall give to the lord John
security, both by himself and by the barons, 98 archbishops, and
bishops of his dominions, as also by the king of France. But, if
the said earl John shall attempt to deny that the said letters
were his, or that he swore to that effect, the men of the king of
England shall sufficiently prove in the court of the king of
France, by fit and proper witnesses, that he did swear to obtain
money to procure the liberation of the king of England. And
if it shall be proved, as has been said, that the said earl swore
to seek money for the liberation of the king, or if he shall fail
in making his proof, then the king of France shall not interest
98 By oath made by them to that effect.

himself about earl John, if he shall think fit to make peace in
relation to his own territory above-named. As to count Louis,
the following shall be the terms agreed to : The king of Eng-
land shall, according to the advice and to the satisfaction of the
king of Trance and the archbishop of Kheims, assign to him a
yearly revenue in his own territory of five hundred pounds An-
jouin, or more if more there shall be, and shall cause promise to
be made to him on oath that he will render to count Louis the
rights and services that his father rendered to count Theobald ;
and the king of England shall repay to count Louis as much
money as he retained after the death of count Theobald, and
which he ought to have paid him. As to Hugh de Gurnay, the
following shall be the terms agreed to : Hugh shall hold all
the lands which he has anywhere held of the king of France,
unless it shall so be that the said Hugh, of his own free
will, and without compulsion, and without desertion of the
king of France, shall wish to return to the king of England ;
and the king of France shall be ready to interrogate the said
Hugh thereon, without employing force and losing any rights
of his own thereby. But, if Hugh shall be unwilling to re-
turn to the king of England with the lands which he holds of
the king of France, and shall wish to hold other lands of his
in England and Normandy of the king of England, and not to
receive anything in exchange for such land, nor to accede to
any terms entered into by the king of France and the king of
England relative thereto, then the king of England shall be
bound to make to the said Hugh a reasonable warranty relative
thereto. The count of Angouleme and his people shall be set at
liberty, and shall safely return to his territory, and he and his
people shall be in the same state in which they were before the
war ; nor shall he or his receive any detriment for anything that
shall have taken place during the war. The count of Perche
shall hold his revenues in full in England, and the king of Eng-
land and his people shall preserve the peace towards him. The
count of MelLent shall again enjoy his lands in the territory
of the king of England. When the king of England shall
have made peace with the king of France, he shall do ser-
vice and pay all lawful dues, in the court of the king of
France, for every fee which he holds of him, in such manner
as each fee is bound to pay. Also, the king of England shall
pay to the king of France twenty thousand marks of silver,
good and pure, Troy weight, payable to him in two years,



300 ANNALS OF BOGER DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1193.

at the following periods : at the end of the first half year, from
the day of his liberation from the custody of the emperor, five
thousand marks ; at the end of the next half year, from that
period, five thousand marks ; at the end of the next half year,
from that period, five thousand marks ; and at the end of the
next half year from that period, the remaining five thousand
marks of silver. As security for the observance of all these
covenants, the king of England shall deliver to the king of
France Loches and Chatillon sur Saone, and to the archbishop
of Rheims, Driencourt and Arches. These four castles also
shall be maintained at the expense of the king of England on
the following terms : "William des Roches, or he who shall be
in his place, shall deliver to the king of France two thousand
pounds Anjouin each month, which shall suffice for a month ;
and he shall always place in the said castles as much provisions
as shall suffice for two months; in Loches, for eleven knights and
a hundred and forty men-at-arms; in Chatillon, for four knights
and forty men-at-arms. For Driencourt and Arches, the senes-
chal of Normandy shall make arrangements for provisions and
garrison according to the will and option of the archbishop
of Rheims. In case all the aforesaid covenants shall be fully
observed to the king of France, then, when five thousand
marks of silver shall have been paid -on behalf of the king of
England to the king of France, the king of France shall re-
store to him such one of the aforesaid castles as the king of
France shall think fit. And, again, when five thousand marks
of silver shall have been paid on behalf of the king of England
to the king of France, the king of France shall restore to him
another such one of the aforesaid castles as the king of France
shall think fit. But, if ten thousand marks shall be paid at
the same time to the king of France, on behalf of the
king of England, the king of France shall restore to him such
two" of the said four castles as the king of France shall think
fit. And, if fifteen thousand marks shall be paid at the
same time to the king of France, the king of France shall re-
store to him such three of the said four castles as the king of
France shall think fit. And, if the whole twenty thousand
marks shall be paid at the same time to the king of France,
the said four castles shall be restored to the king of England.
The king of France, however, shall restore not one of the said
four castles unless the said covenants as to paying the afore-
99 " Domino," is clearly a misprint for " duo."

said sum of money, as to earl John, as to count Louis, as to the
count of Angouleme and his people, as to the count of Perche,
and as to the count of Mellent, shall be duly observed by him and
his. Also, when the king of France shall have received pos-
session of Loches and Chatillon, and the archbishop of Rheims
of Driencourt and Arches, the king of France will receive the
king of England into his favour for the carrying out of the afore-
said covenants, according to the tenor of this present instrument,
and will entreat the emperor to set the king of England at
liberty. The said chancellor, and "William des Koches, John
de Pratelles, and William Bruyere, have also sworn upon the
soul of the king of England that the king of England shall ob-
serve the covenants which are contained in the present instru-
ment, and that, when the king of England shall return, he shall,
in his own person, make oath within a reasonable time after
he shall have been summoned by the king of France, that
he will observe the aforesaid covenants, and will give to him
his letters patent thereon. In addition to this, the four per-
sons aforesaid, and with them the constable of Normandy, Ko-
bert de Harencourt, and Stephen de Longchamp, have made
oath that, if the king of England shall not observe the afore-
said covenants, they will, at Paris, place themselves in the
custody of the king of France. Such of the archbishops,
bishops, and barons of the territory of the king of England,
as the king of France shall think fit, shall, when called upon,
make oath that they will, at Paris, place themselves in the
custody of the king of France, if the king of England shall not
observe the aforesaid covenants, according to the tenor of this
present treaty. And if the king of England shall chance to
die before the king of France shall have restored the said four
castles, then the king of France shall restore the said four
castles to his right heir, in consideration of his performing the
said covenants, according to the tenor of this present treaty,
saving always the rights of the king of France. To the end
that all the matters aforesaid may remain ratified and in-
violate, I, William, bishop of Ely, chancellor of the king of
England, and I, William des Roches, and I, John de Pratelles,
and I, William Bruyere, have, by command of our lord the
king of England, corroborated the same with the attestation
of our respective seals. Done at Mayenne, in the year from
the Incarnation of our Lord one thousand one hundred and
ninety-three, on the eighth day before the ides of July."



302 ANNALS OF HOGEB DE HOVEDEJf. A.D. 1193.

In the same year, Richard, king of England, while he was
still in the custody of the Roman emperor, gave to Hubert
Fitz- Walter, archbishop of Salisbury, the archbishopric of Can-
terbury, to Savaric, archdeacon of Northampton, the bishopric
of Bath, and to Henry Marshal, dean of York, the bishopric of
Exeter ; also, to Master Philip of Poitiers, his clerk, the king
gave the archdeaconry of Canterbury, to Henry, abbat of Glas-
tonbury, he gave the bishopric of Worcester, and to the said
Savaric, bishop of Bath, he gave the abbey of Glastonbury.
Accordingly, on Henry Marshal, the dean of York, being elected
to. the bishopric of Exeter, Geoffrey, archbishop of York, who
was at this time staying at Ripon, gave to his brother Peter
the deanery of York, in presence of Hamo, the pracentor,
Simon of Apulia, and a considerable number of his other
clerks. But because the said Peter was at this time at Paris,
and Richard, king of England, most urgently demanded
that the archbishop would give the deajjery to John, prior of
Douay, brother of the Advocate of Bethune, the said arch-
bishop, by the advice of his people, gave the deanery to Simon
of Apulia, his clerk, and by this method evaded the king's
request.

But, some time after, the archbishop wanted to undo what
he had done ; and told the said Simon that he had only given
the deanery into his charge to be kept in behalf of his brother
Peter ; on which the canons of the church of York, with one
consent, elected the said Simon as their dean, though contrary
to the wishes of the archbishop. In consequence of this, the
said archbishop, in order that he might please the king, gave
to the aforesaid master Philip, 1 clerk to the king, and one of
his household, the said deanery ; on which a dissension broke
out between the archbishop of York and his canons ; of which
the following was the cause and origin.

At the time when Richard, king of England, on his return,
from the land of Jerusalem, had been made prisoner and de-
tained in Germany, and an agreement had been entered into,
between him and the emperor, as to obtaining his release by
ransom, the king had, by his letters, especially entrusted to
the archbishop of York the charge of his territories and the
liberation of his person. On receiving this command, being
moved with sorrow for his brother's captivity, he called upon
those canons with whom he was most familiarly acquainted,
1 Philip of Poitiers, archdeacon of Canterbury, before mentioned.



A.D. 1193. POPE CLEMENT SEXDS THE PALL TO HUBERT. 303

and whom he had enriched and exalted, and advised and en-
treated them to give the fourth part of their revenues towards
the liberation of the said king, as had been already done in
other parts of the kingdom. To this they objected, and, getting
the other canons to join their party, asserted that, in this case
and other similar ones, he was wishful to subvert the liberties
of their church ; and accordingly withdrew from his acquaint-
anceship, and all converse and communication with him.

At this time, as already-mentioned, the deanery of the church
of York was vacant, the presentation to which the archbishop
asserted to belong to himself, while the chapter declared that
the election lay in their hands. Consequently, an appeal was
made on behalf of the archbishop to the Apostolic See ; but
for all this, the chapter proceeded to the election of master
Simon of Apulia as dean ; after which, the said Simon crossed
over to the king, who, as previously mentioned, was at this time
in Germany. Messengers were also sent by the archbishop to
the Apostolic See for the purpose of urging the appeal, but
so as to pass through Germany and see the king on their
road. On their coming before the king and paying their re-
spects to him, and declaring the causes of their journey, the
king forbade either side going for this reason to the Roman
Court, and forbade the person who should attempt to do so,
without his consent, to enter his kingdom, declaring that he
would, without delay, effect a reconciliation between them.

Accordingly, one of the messengers of the archbishop re-
turned to him with letters from the king, signifying that he
was, with all haste, to come to him, as, indeed, he had pur-
posed, but was hindered by circumstances of an emergent
nature. For, in the meantime, the canons of York had sus-
pended the great church from the usual celebration of Divine
service, and the bells from being rung as usual ; on account of
which the whole city was in commotion. They also stripped
the altars, and placed a lock on the archbishop's stall in the
choir ; they also locked up the door by which he entered the
church when coming from his palace and chapel thither, and
did many other things for the purpose of insulting him.

Consequently, when he was just ready to embark, he returned
to his church from the coast, and sent before some of his clerks
to warn and command the servants of the church, to observe the
ancient forms, and to perform the service therein ; but, setting
at nought his warning and commands, they left the church



304 ANNULS OF EOGEE DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1193.

empty, and deprived of the celebration of Divine service
therein.

In the same year, pope Clement sent the pall to Hubert
Fitz- Walter, the archbishop elect of Canterbury. In the same
year, Philip, king of France, married Botilda, 2 daughter of
Waldemar, the former king of Denmark, and sister of Canute,
the then reigning king of Denmark, at Amiens, on a Saturday,
in the month of September ; and on the following day had her
crowned and consecrated queen of France before the envoys
of the king of Denmark who had escorted her to him, with
the intention that the said king of Denmark might be induced
to invade England with a naval armament. But, on the mor-
row after the first night on which the said king of France had
known his said wife, after having consummated the marriage,
he wished to send her away. However, when he wanted to
place her in the hands of the envoys of her brother, they de-
clined to receive her, but departed in all haste and returned
to their own country, while she remained in the hands of the
king of France, her husband ; and, shortly after, a divorce was
effected between them by William, archbishop of Rheims, and,
upon the oaths of Reginald, bishop of Chartres, Philip, bishop
of Beauvais, Robert, count de Drues, the count de Nevers,
Walter, the chamberlain of the king of France, and many
other persons, who swore that the said daughter of the king
of Denmark was cousin of the earl of Hainault, whose daughter
the said king of France had previously married. But the
reason for the king of France acting thus, was, that he might
marry the daughter of the count Palatine of the Rhine, in
Germany, the uncle of the before-named emperor of the Ro-
mans. However, when she was offered by her father and her
other relations to the king of France, she refused to have him ;
and, by the advice of her mother, she married Henry, duke of
Saxony, nephew of Richard, king of England.

In the meantime, Walter, archbishop of Rouen, and the
other justiciaries of England, received for the king's ransom,
from every knight's fee, twenty shillings, and the fourth part
of all the incomes of the laity, and all the chalices of the
churches, besides the other treasures of the church. Some
of the bishops, also, took from the clergy the fourth part of
their revenues, while others took a tenth, for the ransom of the
Baid king. The same was done throughout all the king's ter-
5 Roger of Wendover calls her " Ingelburg."

ritories beyond sea, and in this way they amassed an end-
less amount of money. After this, the emperor's messengers
came to London, and there received the greater part of the
king's ransom by weight and measure, and delivered the same,
under the attestation of their seals, to persons who were to take
it to the borders of the empire, at the risk of the king of Eng-
land. The said emperor also gave to the king of England
the lands under- written : Provence, Vienne, the Viennais,
Marseilles, Narbonne, Arles-le-Blanc, and Laon-sur-Rhone,
as far as the Alps, and whatever the emperor possessed in
Burgundy, as also the homage of the king of Arragon, the
homage of the count of Diziers, and the homage of the count of
Saint Gilles. It deserves to be known that in these territories
there are five archbishoprics and thirty- three bishoprics. It
ought also to be known that the emperor was never able to
establish his dominion over the said territories and subjects,
nor would they, upon the nomination of the emperor, accept
of any superior lord.

The king of England immediately sent to England for queen
Eleanor, his mother, and for Walter, archbishop of Rouen, and
many other persons, to come to him in Germany, and appointed
Hubert, archbishop of Canterbury, chief justiciary in England.
In the meantime, Henry, emperor of the Romans, by the ad-
vice of the principal men of his empire, named as the day
for the liberation of Richard, king of England, the second day
of the week ensuing after the expiration of three weeks from
the day of the Nativity of our Lord ; 3 on which the king of
England wrote to Hubert, archbishop of Canterbury, to the
following effect :

The Letter of Richard, king of England, to Hubert, archbishop
of Canterbury, on his liberation.

" Richard, by the grace of God, king of England, duke of
Normandy and Aquitaine, and earl of Anjou, to the venerable
father in Christ, and his most dearly-beloved friend, Hubert, by
the same grace, archbishop of Canterbury, health and the full-
ness of his sincere affection. Inasmuch as we feel certain that
you greatly long for our liberation, and that our liberation will
very greatly delight you, we do therefore desire that you should
be partakers of our joy. For this reason it is that we have
thought proper to make known to your affection, that his lord-

ship the emperor has appointed a certain day for our liberation,
namely, the Monday next ensuing after the twentieth day from
the day of the Nativity of our Lord ; and on the Lord's day then
next ensuing, we shall be crowned king of the kingdom of Pro-
vence, which he has given unto us. Wherefore, we do send into
England to you the letters patent of our lord the emperor rela-
tive hereto, as also to the rest of our friends and well-wishers ;
and do you in the meantime, to the best of your power, endea-
vour to console those whom you know to love us, and whom
you know to long for our release. Witness myself at Spires,
this twenty-second day of September."

The Letter of the emperor Henry to the nobles of England, on the
liberation of Richard, king of England.

" Henry, by the grace of God, emperor of the Romans, and
ever august, to his dearly-beloved friends, the archbishops,
bishops, earls, barons, knights, and all the faithfnl subjects of
Richard, the illustrious king of England, his favour and every
blessing. We have thought proper to intimate to all and every
of you, that we have appointed a certain day for the liberation
of our dearly-beloved friend, your lord, Richard, the illustrious
king of the English, being the second day of the week next
ensuing after the expiration of three weeks from the day of the
Nativity of our Lord, at Spires, or else at Worms; and we have
appointed seven days after that as the day of his coronation as
king of Provence, which we have promised to him ; and this
you are to consider as certain and undoubted. For it is our
purpose and our will to exalt and most highly to honor your
aforesaid lord, as being our especial friend. Given at The-
alluse, on the vigil of Saint Thomas the Apostle."

But before this treaty was confirmed between the emperor
and the king, the king sent William, bishop of Ely, his chan-
cellor, and other envoys, into Prance, to earl John, his brother,
and prevailed upon him to return to Normandy, and to swear
fealty and peace to the king, his brother, against all men. The
king also gave orders that all the castles of the honors which
he had given to him, on either side of the sea, should be deli-
vered up to him ; but their keepers, notwithstanding the king's
writ, refused to deliver up to him any of the said castles. The
earl, being enraged at this, returned to the king of France, and
became his adherent ; on which the king of France delivered



A.J). 1194. ENVOYS SENT TO THE EMPEROB OF THE BOMANS. 307

to him the castle of Driencourt, and the castle of Arches, which
were to have been delivered to "William, archbishop of Rheims.

In the same year, Berengaria, queen of England, Joanna,
queen of Sicily, and the daughter of the emperor of Cyprus,
came to Rome, under the charge of Stephen de Turnham, and
were honorably received by our lord the pope, Celestinus, and
the nobles of Rome ; and they stayed there nearly half a year,
through fear of the emperor. When they departed thence,
our lord the pope gave them into the charge of Master Mellur,
a cardinal ; on which they proceeded to Pisa, thence to Genoa,
and thence to Marseilles. At Marseilles they were received
by the king of Arragon, who paid them all due honor and
respect, and escorted them to the borders of his kingdom, on
which the count of Saint Gilles escorted them through his terri-
tory ; and thus they arrived in Poitou.

In the year of grace 1194, being the second year of the cap-
tivity of Richard, king of England, the said Richard was still
in the custody of the emperor of the Romans, at Spires, in
Germany, on the day of the Nativity of our Lord, which took
place on a Saturday ; and there he remained until the time of
his liberation which the emperor had appointed for him, that
is to say, the second day of the week after the expiration
of three weeks from the day of the Nativity of our Lord. After
the emperor had arrived there, together with the archbishops,
bishops, dukes, and nobles of his empire, and had discussed
at length the liberation of the king of England, there came to
the emperor envoys from the king <3f France, and envoys from
John, earl of Mortaigne, brother of the king of England ; and
they made offer to the emperor, on behalf of the king of France,
of fifty thousand marks of silver, and on behalf of earl John of
fifty thousand marks of silver, on condition that he should
keep the king of England in his custody until the Feast of
Saint Michael the Archangel next ensuing ; or, if the emperor
should prefer it, they would pay him at the end of every month,
so long as he should detain the king of England in his custody,
one thousand pounds of silver ; or, again, if the emperor should
prefer it, the king of France would give him one hundred
thousand marks of silver, and the earl John would give him
fifty thousand marks of silver, on condition that he would de-
liver up to them the king of England, or at least detain him
in his custody for the space of one year from that time. Be-
hold, how they loved him ! After hearing them, the emperor

x 2



308 ANNALS OF ROGER DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1194.

put off the day of the liberation of the king of England, and
appointed another day for his liberation, namely, the day of
the Purification of Saint Mary, and at Mentz.

In the meantime, Geoffrey, archbishop of York, on the
eighth day before the Nativity of our Lord, came to York, and,
by the advice of prudent men, appointed ministers for the
metropolitan church of York, which he found deserted, in
order that they might, as was fitting, perform Divine service
in the said church. And this was accordingly observed, until
the canons and their chaplains, by means of the influence
and violence of the laity, were restored. After this, four of
the chief men of the church, who, in consequence of the sus-
pension of service in the said church, had been excommunicated,
crossed over to the king who was then set at liberty, and, re-
ceiving permission from him, because he was angry that the
archbishop had not come as he had been commanded by him,
set out for Rome. Against them, deputies were also sent thither
by the archbishop.

Each side accordingly appearing in presence of pope Celes-
tinus, the election of the dean was discussed at great length, and
after due deliberation, as it was acknowledged to have taken
place after appeal duly made, it was therefore to be annulled,
or rather to be pronounced as having been null and void. Our
lord the pope, also, being wishful for the present to avoid pro-
nouncing a decision in the matter, whether the presentation
to the deanery of right belonged to the archbishop or to the
chapter, relying on his own power, the extent of which it is
lawful for no one to question, saving always for the future the
rights both of the archbishop as also of the chapter, gave the
deanery to the before-named Simon of Apulia, and confirmed,
and with his golden ring invested him with the same.

This matter being thus disposed of, they immediately pro-
ceeded to slander and accusations against the said archbishop,
declaring that he was a violent spoliator of themselves and
the other clergy, a dishonest extortioner, that he had with
an armed band broken open the doors of churches, had simo-
niacally divided and retained in his own hands ecclesiastical
benefices, that he had paid no regard to appeals, and had set at
nought the privileges of the Roman Pontiff, and, to express it
in a few words, asserted that he quite despised his duties as
archbishop, and was devoted to hawking, hunting, and other
military pursuits. For these, and for other reasons, they sought



A.D. 1194. LIBERATION OF EICHAED, ZING OF ENGLAND. 309

to depose him ; and they in especial, whom he had enriched
with the greatest honors, and with inestimable wealth and
revenues in the church of York, and beyond what, with due
regard to God, he ought to have done. Of such it is, that the
Lord saith, " I have nourished and brought up children, and
they have rebelled against me." 4 Therefore, let them beware,
lest the just Judge despise them, and lest with the traitor
Judas they be condemned to hell.

These allegations being made, our lord the pope wrote to
Hugh, bishop of Lincoln, and his fellow judges, that if there
should be any to accuse the archbishop on these charges, they
should carefully hear what was alleged on either side, and
after enquiry into the truth thereof, send their report, sealed
with their seals, to the Apostolic See. But, if no accuser
should appear, and the archbishop should be attacked by pub-
lic rumour, they were to call upon him to clear himself by
the testimony of three bishops and as many abbats. But, as
the archbishop had appealed before the citation of the judges,
and had proceeded on the road for the purpose of urging his
appeal, the said judges, in accordance with the contents of the
rescript of our lord the pope, assigned him a space of three months
for the said appeal, appointing the calends of July as the day for
his^ippearance. The archbishop, however, did not appear at the
time so named, both on account of the king's prohibition, as also
by reason of the unwholesomeness of the atmosphere that then
prevailed at Rome. His clerks, however, who were at this
time staying at the court of Rome, alleging the above as the
causes of his absence, obtained of the pope, that whatever had
been done against the archbishop in the meantime, after his
appeal, should be revoked, as being null and void ; because it was
not his fault that he had not come to the court of Rome ; and
the time on which he was to present himself in the Apos-
tolical presence was fixed by our lord the pope, upon the
octave of the feast of Saint Martin, then next ensuing. But
because not even then he appeared in the Roman court,, either
personally, or by sufficient proxy, he was at the Nativity of
our Lord next ensuing, suspended from the performance of all
episcopal duties.

nobles of his empire, and Richard, king of England, with queen
Eleanor, his mother, Walter, archbishop of Rouen, William,
bishop of Ely, his chancellor, and Savaric, bishop of Bath, met
at Mentz, on the Purification of Saint Mary, and, a con-
ference being there held as to the liberation of the king of
England, the emperor wished, in his eagerness for the money
which the king of France and earl John had offered him, to
recede from his agreement. Bringing with him the envoys from
the king of Prance and the envoys from earl John, in whose
number was Robert de Nunant, brother of Hugh, bishop of
Coventry, he delivered to the king of England the letters of
the king of France and of earl John for him to read, which
they had sent to prevent his liberation. On seeing and read-
ing these, the king was very much disturbed and confused,
and despaired of his liberation.

Accordingly, by his summons, the emperor convened on this
subject the archbishops of Mentz, Cologne, and Saltzburg, the
bishops of Worms, Spires, and Liege, the duke of Suabia,
the brother of the emperor, the dukes of Austria and Lou-
vain, the count Palatine of the Rhine, and the other nobles
of the empire who had been sureties on behalf of the emperor
between him and the king of England for his performance of
the articles agreed upon between them. These boldly appeared
before the emperor, and reproved him most severely for attempt-
ing in so shameless a manner to recede from his agreement,
and prevailed upon him to release and dismiss the king of Eng-
land from his custody : a stipulation, however, having been
made that the king of England should deliver to the emperor
Walter, archbishop of Rouen, Savaric, bishop of Bath, Bald-
win Wac, and many others of his earls and barons, as hos-
tages for the payment of the remainder of the money due
for his ransom, and for his keeping the peace towards the
emperor and his empire, and all the lands of his dominions.

Accordingly, the archbishops of Mentz and Cologne delivered
him, free and released by the emperor, into the hands of his
mother Eleanor, on the day before 5 the nones of February,
being the sixth day of the week, an Egyptian day, or what
the people of modern times call an unlucky day ; and so, upon
an unlucky day, the Lord restored him to liberty. On the said
king asking Robert de Nunant, brother of Hugh, bishop of
Coventry, to be one of his hostages, Robert made answer that

A.D. 1194. LIBERATION OF RICHARD, KING OF ENGLAND. 311

he was a liegeman of earl John, and, therefore, declined to he a
hostage for him ; at which the king being incensed, ordered him
to be seized and thrown into prison, which was accordingly
done.

On the same day on which the king was set at liberty from
the custody of the emperor, he sent one Salt de Brail, as his
messenger, to his nephew, Henry, count of Champagne, in Sulia,
and the other Christian princes, informing them of the day of
his liberation ; and that, if God should grant him vengeance
against his enemies, and peace, he would come by the time ap-
pointed to succour them against the pagans. He also promised
to the said Salt de Bruil that he would give him lands to the
value of forty pounds on his return from the land of Sulia.
On the same day, the king, by his letters, summoned Hugh,
bishop of Coventry, to appear in his court, and to take his
trial before the bishops, because he himself was a bishop, and
before certain laymen, because he held under him a layman's
office, upon the charges that were made against him.

On the same day, the emperor of the Eomans, and the arch-
bishops, bishops, dukes, and counts of the empire, joining in a
letter in common, and appending their seals thereto, sent word
to the king of France and to earl John, immediately upon
sight of the said letter to restore to the king of England the
castles, cities, fortresses, towns, lands, and all other things
which they had taken from him, while he had been in the
custody of the emperor ; and, unless they did so, they were to
know for certain that they would aid the king of England to
the utmost of their power, in recovering everything that he
had lost. After this, the king of England made promise of, and
by his charters confirmed, to certain archbishops, bishops,
dukes, and counts, and many of the barons of the empire, yearly
revenues, for their homage and fealty, and aid against the king
of France. He accordingly received the homage of the arch-
bishop of Mentz, the archbishop of Cologne, the bishop of
Liege, the duke of Austria, the duke of Lou vain, the marquis
of Montferrat, the duke of Nemburg, 6 the duke of Suabia, the
brother of the emperor, the count Palatine of the Ehine, the
son of the count of Hainault, the count of Holland, and many
others, saving always their fealty to the emperor.

It ought also to be known that the king of England was in
captivity with the emperor during a period of one year, six
weeks, and three days.

On the king being set at liberty, all who were present shed
tears of joy. The emperor then gave to the king a safe con-
duct as far as the port of Antwerp. On the king reaching
Cologne, the archbishop of Cologne received him with joy; and,
in his delight at his liberation, celebrated the following mass :
" Nunc scio vere, quia misit Dominus angelum suum, et
eripuit me de manu Herodis, et de expectatione plebis Judcsorum,"
&c. 7 And, when the king took his departure thence, the
said archbishop escorted him as far as the gate of Antwerp,
where the river Ehine falls into the sea. 8 On the king arriving
at this place, he embarked on board the galley of Alan Trenche-
mere, in order that in it he might more easily pass among the
islands ; but each night he left the galley and went on board
a large and very fine ship which had come from Eye, and lay on
board of it at night, and then, in the daytime, returned on board
the galley, until he arrived at the port of Swiene, which is
in Flanders, in the territory of the count of Hainault, having
been four days on his voyage from the port of Antwerp to the
port of Swiene ; and he made a stay of five days in the port of
Swiene. On the sixth day, about the third hour, he left the
port of Swiene ; and, on the day after, about the ninth hour,
landed in England, at the port of Sandwich, it being the third
day before the ides of March, 9 and the Lord's Day.

In the meantime, there came into England, not long before the
king's arrival, Adam, of Saint Edmund's, a clerk, and one of the
household of earl John, being sent by him to England with
letters for the purpose of fortifying his castles against the king,
his brother. Having come to London, and it being in his
power to cross over without any hindrance, he went to the
mansion of Hubert, archbishop of Canterbury, and dined
with him; where he uttered many boasts about the prosperous
circumstances of his master, and the familiar acquaintanceship
that existed between the king of France and his master, and
mentioned that the king of France had delivered up to him
the castle of Driencourt and the castle of Arches, which were
to have been placed in the hands of the archbishop of Kheims,
according to the terms of the writing above-mentioned, and

said that he would have delivered stll more to his master, if
his master had had men in whom he could place confidence.

The consequence was, that with these and similar boasts he
exasperated the lord archbishop of Canterbury, and all who
heard these speeches ; but still, from respect to the table, no one
laid hands on him. However, after dinner, when the before-
named Adam was on his return to his lodging, the mayor of
London laid hands on him, and detained him, and took pos-
session of all his documents, in which were contained the com-
mands of earl John, and gave them up to the archbishop of
Canterbury. On the following day, having convened in his
presence the bishops, earls, and barons of the kingdom, he
shewed them the letters of earl John, and the purport thereof ;
immediately on which, by the common consent of the council
of the kingdom, it was decided that earl John should be dis-
seised of all his lands in England, and that his castles should
be besieged ; which was accordingly done.

On the same day, Hubert, archbishop of Canterbury, Hugh,
bishop of Lincoln, Richard, bishop of London, Gilbert, bishop
of Rochester, Godfrey, bishop of Winchester, the bishops of
Worcester and Hereford, and Henry, bishop elect of Exeter,
together with the abbats and many of the clergy of the pro-
vince of Canterbury, met together in the chapel of the Sick
Monks at Westminster, and pronounced sentence of excom-
munication against earl John, and all his abettors and advisers,
who had disturbed the peace and kingdom of the king of Eng-
land, or should disturb the same, unless, desisting from their
hostilities, they should come to give him satisfaction. They
then appealed to the presence of our lord the pope, against
William, bishop of Ely, in order that he might not in future
discharge the duties of the legateship in England, and, confirm-
ing their appeal with their seals, sent the same to our lord the
king, and then to the Supreme Pontiff, for his confirmation.
This appeal was made on the fourth day before the ides of
February, being the fifth day of the week.

Upon this, all the persons who had charge of the siege of
the castles belonging to earl John, returned to their homes. 10
Accordingly, the bishop of Durham, to whom had been en-
trusted the siege of the castle of Tickhill, levied a large army
in Yorkshire and Northumberland, and other parts of his lands,

10 This seems contradicted by what follows, unless we take " patrias
suas " to mean " their respective districts."



314 ANNALS OF BOGEE DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1194.

and laid siege to it. Earl David, also, brother of the king of
Scotland, with Ranulph, earl of Chester, and the earl of Ferrers,
with a great army, laid siege to Nottingham castle. The arch-
bishop of Canterbury, also, with a large force, laid siege to
Marlborough, which was in a few days surrendered to him,
safety to life and limb being granted to 'the garrison. In like
manner, the castle of Lancaster, of which Theobald Fitzwalter,
his brother, had charge in behalf of earl John, was surrendered
to him ; Saint Michael's Mount, in Cornwall, was also surren-
dered to him, which Henry de la Pomeroy, after expelling the
monks, had fortified against the king ; and the said Henry, on
hearing of the king's arrival, died of fright.

These three castles, however, Marlborough, Lancaster, and
Saint Michael's Mount, were surrendered before the king's
arrival ; while the other two, namely, Nottingham and Tick-
hill, made a stout resistance to the besiegers. But, on
hearing of the king's arrival, the people in the castle of
Tickhill, with the permission of the bishop of Durham, sent
two knights to see if the king really had returned, and to offer
their castle to him. The king, however, refused to receive it,
unless they would place themselves at his mercy, without any
exception ; and accordingly they returned, and told Robert de
la Mare, the constable of the castle, and the rest of the garrison,
the king's intentions. Upon this, after conferring with the
bishop of Durham, who had promised them safety to life and
limb, they surrendered to him, in the king's behalf, the castle
of Tickhill.

The garrison, however, of the castle of Nottingham did not
send any of their number to meet the king. The king, being
consequently much exasperated, came to Nottingham on the day
of the Annunciation of our Lord, being the sixth day of the
week, with such a vast multitude of men, and such a clangor
of trumpets and clarions, that those who were in the castle, on
hearing and seeing this, were astonished, and were confounded
and alarmed, and trembling came upon them; but still they
could not believe that the king had come, and supposed that the
whole of this was done by the chiefs of the army for the purpose
of deceiving them. The king, however, took up his quarters
near to the castle, so that the archers of the castle pierced the
king's men at his very feet. The king, being incensed at this,
put on his armour, and commanded his army to make an assault
on the castle ; on which a sharp engagement took place between



A.D. 1194. THE BESIEGED IMPLOBE THE KDfG's MEKCT. 315

them and the people in the castle, and many fell on both sides,
killed and wounded. The king himself slew one knight with
an arrow, and having at last prevailed, drove them hack into
the castle, took some outworks which they had thrown up with-
out the gates, and burned the outer gates.

On the same day came thither Hubert, the archbishop of
Canterbury, having his cross carried before him. Geoffrey,
archbishop of York, however, did not have his cross carried, but
made complaint to the king about the archbishop, who had
caused his cross to be carried in the diocese of York. "When
the archbishop of Canterbury heard this, and saw that the arch-
bishop of York did not have his carried, he made answer, "I
carry my cross throughout the whole of England, and I ought
to carry it, as being primate of the whole of England ; whereas
you do not carry your cross, and, perhaps, you ought not to
carry it ; and therefore, matters standing as they do, I make
appeal to my lord the pope."

On the twenty-sixth day of the month of March, the king
of England ordered his stone-engines to be put together, hav-
ing come to the determination that he would not make another
assault on the castle until his engines of war had been got in
readiness ; but he ordered gibbets to be erected near the castle,
on which he hanged some men-at-arms of earl John, who had
been taken prisoners outside of the castle.

On the twenty-seventh day of the month of March, Hugh,
bishop of Durham, and those who were with him at the siege
of the castle of Tickhill, came to the king at Nottingham, bring-
ing with them the prisoners who had been taken in the castle
of Tickhill ; on which the king went forth to meet them. On
seeing the king the bishop of Durham dismounted, and the
king, in like manner, went to meet him and embraced him ;
after which, remounting their horses, they repaired to the siege.
On the same day, while the king was sitting at dinner, Ralph
Murdac, and William de Wendeval, constables of the castle or
Nottingham, sent two of their companions to see the king ; who
after having seen him, returned to the castle, to tell those
who had sent them what they had heard and seen respecting
the king and his preparations.

When William de Wendeval and Roger de Montbegum
heard of this, they went forth with twelve others, from the
castle, and threw themselves upon the king's mercy, and re-
turned to the castle no more. On the twenty-eighth day of



316 ANNALS OP EOGEE DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1194.

March, through the mediation of the archbishop of Canterbury,
Ralph Murdac, Philip de Worcester, and Ralph de Worcester,
his brother, and all the rest who were in the castle, surrendered
the castle to the king, and threw themselves on the king's
mercy, for life, and limb, and worldly honor.

On the twenty-ninth day of March, Richard, king of Eng-
land, went to see Clipston and the forests of Sherwood,
which he had never seen before, and they pleased him greatly ;
after which, on the same day, he returned to Nottingham.
On the thirty-first day of March, being the fourth day of the
week, Richard, king of England, held the first day of his
council at Nottingham, at which were present queen Eleanor,
the king's mother, Hubert, archbishop of Canterbury, who
at that council sat on the king's right hand, Geoffrey,
archbishop of York, who sat on his left hand, Hugh, bishop
of Durham, Hugh, bishop of Lincoln, William, bishop of Ely,
the king's chancellor, William, bishop of Hereford, Henry,
bishop of Worcester, Henry, bishop of Exeter, John,
bishop of Whitherne, earl David, brother of the king of Scot-
land, Hamelin, earl of Warenne, Ranulph, earl of Chester,
William, earl of Ferrers, William, earl of Salisbury, and
Roger Bigot.

On the same day, the king dispossessed Gerard de Camville
of the castle and shrievalty of Lincoln, and Hugh Bardolph
of the shrievalty of Yorkshire, and of the castle of York, and
of Scarborough, and of the custodianship of Westmoreland,
and set up all the offices before-mentioned for sale. Ac-
cordingly, after the chancellor had offered to give the king for
the shrievalty of Yorkshire, the shrievalty of Lincolnshire,
and the shrievalty of Northamptonshire, one thousand five
hundred marks at the beginning of the agreement, and every
year an additional hundred marks for each of the said counties,
Geoffrey, archbishop of York, offered the king three thousand
marks for the shrievalty of York, and every year an additional
hundred marks ; on which, the chancellor being outbid, the
archbishop obtained the shrievalty of York, and accordingly
became a servant of the king, and threw himself into the
king's power.

On the thirty-first day of the month of March, that is to
say, on the day before the calends of April, the king of Eng-
land held the second day of his council, at which he demanded
judgment to be pronounced against earl John, his brother, who,



A.D. 1194. COMPLAINTS AGAINST THE AECHBISHOP OF YOEK. 317

against the fealty which he had sworn to him, had taken pos-
session of his castles, laid waste his lands on both sides of the
sea, and had made a treaty against him with his enemy, the
king of France. In like manner, against Hugh de Nunant,
bishop of Coventry, he demanded judgment to be pronounced,
who, being aware 11 of their secret plans, had devoted himself,
and had given his adherence to the king of France and earl
John, his enemies, devising all kinds of mischief to the injury
of his kingdom. Judgment was accordingly given, that earl
John and the bishop of Coventry should be peremptorily cited,
and if they should not come within forty days to take their
trial, they pronounced that earl John had forfeited all rights
in the kingdom, and that the bishop of Coventry would be
subjected to the judgment of the bishops, because he him-
self was a bishop, and of the laity, because he had been a sheriff
under the king.

On the calends of April, being the first day of that month,
the said king of England held the third day of his council, on
which he enacted that there should be granted to him, out of
every carucate of land throughout the whole of England, the
sum of two shillings, which, by the ancients, was called
Temantale. 12 He then commanded that every man should
render to him the third part of a knight's service, according as
each fee would bear, in order to make preparations for crossing
over with him to Normandy He then demanded of the monks
of the Cistercian order all their wool for the current year ; but
as this was to inflict a grievous and insupportable burden upon
them, they made a pecuniary composition with him.

On the second day of the month of April, being Saturday,
he held the fourth and last day of his council, upon which all,
both clergy as well as laity, who wished to make complaint to
him of the archbishop of York, made their complaints, which
were many in number, as to his extortions and unjust exac-
tions ; the archbishop of York, however, gave them no answer.
After this, by the advice and artifices of the chancellor, as it
is said, Gerard de Camville was arraigned for harbouring some
robbers, who had plundered the goods of certain merchants

11 " Consciura " appears to be a mistake for " conscius,"

12 Holinshed calls this " Tee men toll," or " Theynae toll." There is
some doubt as to the origin of the name, whether it is derived from " tene-
mentum," or, more probably, from the Saxon, meaning " a toll paid by ten
men," or " decenniers," the whole of which would amount to a pound.
See vol. i. p. 550.



318 ANNALS OF EOGEK J)E EOVEDEN. A.D. 1194.

going to the fair of Stamford ; and it was said that they had
set out from his residence for the purpose of committing the
robbery, and after committing it, had returned to him. They
also accused him of treason, because he had refused to come
at the summons of the king's justices, or take his trial as to
the aforesaid harbouring of the robbers, or produce them
before the king's justices ; hut made answer that he was a
vassal of earl John, and would take his trial in his court.
They also arraigned him for having taken up arms, and aiding
earl John, and others of the king's enemies, in taking the castles
of Tickhill and Nottingham. Gerard de Camville, however,
denied all these charges which were so made by them against
him ; on which they gave pledges to follow their suit, and
Gerard de Camville gave pledge to defend himself by one of his
freeholders.

On the same day, our lord the king appointed as the day of
his coronation, at Winchester, the close of Easter. On the same
day, the king also proceeded to Clipston, to meet the king of
the Scots, and gave orders that all who had been taken at the
castle of Nottingham, the castle of Tickhill, the castle of Marl-
borough, the castle of Lancaster, and at Mount Saint Michael,
should come and meet him at Winchester the day after the
close of Easter. On the third day of the month of August,
namely, Palm Sunday, the king of England stayed at Clip-
ston, and the king of the Scots at Worksop, on account of the
solemnity of the day. On the fourth day of the month of
April, the king of England and the king of Scotland came to
Sewell. On the fifth day of the month of April, the king of
England and the king of Scotland came toMalton, where the king
of Scotland demanded of the king of England the dignities and
honors which his predecessors had enjoyed in England. He
also demanded that the earldoms of Northumberland, Cumber-
land, and Westmoreland, and the earldom of Lancaster, should
be given up to him, as of right enjoyed by his predecessors :
to which the king made answer, that he would satisfy him ac-
cording to the advice given by his earls and barons.

On the sixth day of the month of April, the said kings
came to the house of Peter the Eorester of Rutland. On the
seventh day of the month of April, the said kings came to
Gaindinton. On the eighth day of the month of April, the
said kings stayed at Gaindinton, out of respect for the day of
the Preparation 13 of our Lord. On the ninth day of the month

of April, on the vigil of Easter, the said kings arrived at
Northampton ; and on the tenth and eleventh days of the
month of April, the said kings stayed at Northampton, where
the king of England, taking counsel with his bishops, earls,
and barons, after due deliberation in -the council, made
answer to the king of Scotland that he ought on no account to
do what he had requested as to Northumberland, and especi-
ally in those times, at which nearly all the powerful men of
the kingdoms of the Franks were at enmity with him. For,
if he were to do so, it would seem that this was rather the
effect of fear than of affection.

However, in the presence of his mother Eleanor, Hubert,
archbishop of Canterbury, Hugh, bishop of Durham, Jocelyn,
bishop of Glasgow, and many others, both clergy and laity,
of both kingdoms, the king granted, and by his charter con-
firmed, to William, king of the Scots, and his heirs for ever,
that whensoever they should, at his summons, come to the
court of the king of England, the bishop of Durham and the
sheriff of Northumberland should receive them at the river
Tweed, and should, with a safe" conduct, escort them as far as
the river Tees, and there the archbishop of York and the sheriff
of York should receive them, and escort them, with a safe
conduct, to the borders of the county of York, and so, by the
respective bishops and sheriffs, they should be escorted from
county to county, until they should have arrived at the court of
the king of England ; and that, from the time that the king of
Scots should enter the territory of the king of England, he
should have daily from the king's purse one hundred shillings
for his livery ; and when the king of Scotland should have
arrived at the court of the king of England, so long as he
should be staying at the court of the said king of England, he
should have daily thirty shillings for his livery, and twelve
wastels 14 for the lords' table, twelve simnels for the lords'
table, 15 and four gallons of wine for the lords 5 table, and eight

14 Wastels were a peculiar kind of delicate bread, probably something
like the rusks of the present day. " Dominicus" is added to describe the
quality, as probably meaning that these articles of provision were to be of
the best kind, and suited for the lords' table.

15 Simnel cakes were prob'ably so called from being made of " simila,"
the finest wheat flour. There were the " siminelli sali," and the " simi-
nelli dominici," the inferior, and the best bread, the latter being unfer-
mented. They were made in the shape of plates, or cups, and were some-
times marked with the figure of the Virgin Mary. They are made in
Shropshire at the present day.

gallons of household wine, two pounds of pepper, four pounds
of cinnamon, two stone of wax or else four waxen links,
forty long and thick lengths of best candle, such as is used by
the king, and eighty lengths of other candle for household pur-
poses : and that, when he should wish to return to his own
country, he should be escorted by the bishops and sheriffs from
county to county, until he should have arrived at the river
Tweed : and should in like manner have daily one hundred
shillings from the purse of the king of England for his livery,

The charter of this grant and confirmation of the king of
England was delivered to William, king of Scotland, in the
town of Northampton, on the second day of Easter, by the hand
of William, bishop of Ely, the king's chancellor.

In the year from the Incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ
1194, which was also the fifth year of the reign of king Eichard,
on the twelfth day of the month of April, being the third day
in Easter week, Eichard, king of England, departed from
Northampton, and proceeded as far as Selveston ; and Hubert,
archbishop of Canterbury, and Hugh, bishop of Durham, pro-
ceeded to Brackley, where was a lodging prepared for the bishop
of Durham, which he had held for thirty years past at the
award of the marshal of king Henry. When his entertainment
had been prepared, the servants of the king of Scotland came
up and attempted to expel the servants of the bishop, but were
unable. However, they purchased provisions for the king, and
prepared the same in a house belonging to the same estate.
When the bishop of Durham came thither, and was told
by his people what had taken place, he was determined
not to move a step thence, but boldly entered his lodging, and
ordered the tables to be set. While he was at dinner, Hubert,
the archbishop of Canterbury, came and offered him his lodg-
ing, and advised him to leave that one to the king of Scot-
land, and quit the house.

When the king of Scotland, at a late hour, returned from hunt-
ing, and was informed of what had happened, he was greatly
offended, and refused to go there, but ordered all that had been
prepared for him to be given to the poor, while he himself went
to the king at Silveston, and made complaint to him of the
insult he had received from the bishop of Durham ; on which,
the king, being greatly vexed, censured the bishop of Durham.

On the thirteenth day of the month of April, the king came
to Woodstock. On the fourteenth day the king came to Free-

mantle. On the fifteenth day of the month of April, the king
of England came to Winchester, and on the same day dispos-
sessed Godfrey, bishop of Winchester, of the castle and county
of Winchester, and of the . two manors which the bishop
had bought of him before his departure for Jerusalem, and
of a great part of his inheritance. On the sixteenth day of
the month of April, after dinner, the king of England left
the castle of Winchester for the priory of Saint Swithin, and
lay there that night, and took the bath ; and he sent word to
Geoffrey, the archbishop of York, not to come next day to his
coronation with his cross, lest there might happen to be a dis-
pute between him and the archbishop of Canterbury. Because
he was forbidden to carry his cross, he declined to be present at
the king's coronation.

The Coronation of Richard, Icing of England, after Tii& liberation.

On the seventeenth day of the month of April, being the Lord's
day, and the octave of Easter, there being assembled in the church
of Saint Swithin, Hubert, archbishop of Canterbury, John, arch-
bishop of Dublin, Hugh, bishop of Durham, Hugh, bishop of
Lincoln*, Richard, bishop of London, Gilbert, bishop of Rochester,
William, bishop of Ely, Sefrid, bishop of Chichester, Henry,
bishop of Exeter, William, bishop of Hereford, and the bishops
of Worcester, Saint David 's and Bangor ; and, many of the
abbats, clergy, and people being there present, Richard, king
of England, arrayed in royal robes and having a crown of gold
on his head, proceeded from his chamber, carrying in his
right hand the royal sceptre, on the top of which was a re-
presentation of the cross, and in his left hand a wand of gold,
on the top of which was the figure of a dove. On his right
hand walked William, bishop of Ely, his chancellor, and on his
left Richard, bishop of London. A procession also preceded
them in due order, of archbishops, bishops, abbats, monks, and
clerks. The earls also, and barons, and knights, and a great
multitude of the common people, followed the king. A canopy
of silk, supported on four lances, was carried over the king,
k by these four earls, Roger Bigot, earl of Norfolk, William,
earl of the Isle of Wight, the earl of Salisbury, and the earl of
Ferrers. Three swords also, taken from the king's treasury,
were borne before the king, one of which was carried by Wil-
liam, king of the Scots, while Hameline, earl of Warenne,
carried another, and Ranulph, earl of Chester, carried the third ;

322 ANXALS OF 110GER DE HOVEDEN. A. D. 1194.

in the middle of them walked the king of the Scots, with the
earl of "Warenne on his right hand, and the earl of Chester on
hi& left. And thus, wearing the crown, he was led into the
metropolitan chnrch of Saint Swithin up to the altar ; where,
falling on his knees, he devoutly received the benediction from
Hugh, archbishop of Canterbury, and was then led to his seat.
Eleanor, the queen's mother, was seated with her maids of
honor on the northern side of the church, opposite the king.
The archbishop of Canterbury also celebrated the mass ; and
the king was led by the before-named bishops to the offertory,
and was then re-conducted to his seat.

After the celebration of the mass, the king was re-conducted
to his chamber, the procession going before him in the order
above stated. Having taken off his more weighty vestments
and his crown, the king put on lighter garments and a lighter
crown, and then entered the refectory of the monks to dine
there ; on which the before-mentioned archbishops and bishops,
with the king of Scotland, and the earls and barons, took their
seats at table, each according to his rank and dignity, and
feasted magnificently. The citizens of London, having made
the king a payment of two hundred marks, served in the cellars,
notwithstanding the claim of the citizens of Winchester. The
citizens of Winchester, however, served in the kitchen. On
the same day, at a late hour, after dinner, the king returned
to his mansion in Winchester castle.

On the eighteenth day of the month of April, being the day
after the king's coronation, Jollan, 16 brother of Henry 17 de la
Pomeroy, was accused of having traitorously taken part in the
capture of Saint Michael's Mount, in Cornwall, and he chose
rather to be banished from England than take his trial on the
charge in the king's court. On the nineteenth day of the month
of April, Hugh, bishop of Durham, of his own accord, no one
compelling him so to do, gave up to the king the county of
Northumberland, with its castles and other appurtenances;
and the king ordered him to deliver the same to Hugh Bar-
dolph.

When William, king of Scotland, heard of this, he imme-
diately offered the king of England fifteen thousand marks
of silver for Northumberland and its appurtenances ; saying
that earl Henry, his father, held it by gift of king Henry the

and evidently a typographical error.

Second, and that after him, king Malcolm, his son, held it in peace
for five years. Upon this, the king of England, after taking
counsel with his people, made answer to the king of Scotland
that he would give him the whole of Northumberland, except-
ing the castles, for the said sum ; but the king of Scotland
declined to receive it without the castles. On the twentieth
day of the month of April, the king of England caused the more
wealthy persons to be separated from the rest of those who had
been taken prisoners in the castles of Tickhill and Nottingham,
and the other caetles of earl John, and to be placed in prison
to be ransomed ; while the others he let go, on their finding
sureties that they would appear at his summons, and abide by
the judgment of his court ; on which each of them found sure-
ties for a hundred marks, if he should not return to the court
of the king.

On the twenty-first day of the month of April, William,
king of the Scots, again made an attempt to see if he could in
any way obtain the earldom of Northumberland with the
castles ; but it did not suit the purpose of the king of England
to trust him with any castles. However, he gave him hopes
of obtaining them at a future time, after his return from Nor-
mandy. On the twenty-second day of the month of April,
being the sixth day of the week, William, king of Scotland,
left the court of the king of England, sorrowful and in con-
fusion at the repulse he had there received. On the same day,
the king of England left Winchester, on his way to the sea,
for the purpose of crossing over, on account of the unfavour-
able reports which he had heard from Normandy, and lay at
Waltham.

On the twenty- third day of the month of April, the king of
England remained at Waltham, and Geoffrey, archbishop of
York, came thither to the king, and caused his cross to be
carried before him. On this, Hubert Fitz-Walter, archbishop
of Canterbury, greatly complained to the king ; but the king
made answer that the matter was not one for him to decide, but
rather our lord the pope. On the same day, the king restored
to Geoffrey, archbishop of York, Baugy and Langis, in Anjou,
and by his charter confirmed the same.

On the twenty-fourth day of April, the king made peace and
a final reconciliation between Geoffrey, archbishop of York,
and William, bishop of Ely, his chancellor, as to all the mat-
ters in dispute between them, both the arrest of the arch-

Y2

bishop of York, at Dover, as also the expulsion of the chancel-
lor from England, upon condition that the said bishop of Ely
should, at the summons of the archbishop of York, make oath,
at the hands 18 of one hundred priests, that he had neither
ordered nor desired that the said archbishop of York should be
arrested. After this reconciliation was effected, on the same
day, the king departed from Waltham, and proceeded to Ports-
mouth, for the purpose of crossing over, and queen Eleanor,
his mother, with him.

On the twenty-fifth, twenty-sixth, and twenty-seventh days
of the month of April, the king was staying at Portsmouth.
On the twenty-eighth day of the month of April, the king
left Portsmouth, and proceeded as far as Stansted, for the
sake of hunting ; but, after his departure, the Welch and the
Brabanters had a hostile meeting, and slew one another. On
the twenty-ninth day of April, the king returned to Ports-
mouth, for the purpose of quelling the dissensions of the
Welch and the Brabanters, which/ was accordingly done.

On the thirtieth day of the month of April, and the first day
of the month of May, on the feasts of the Apostles Saint Philip
and Saint James, the king was staying at that place ; which
appeared to him to be very tedious. On the second day of the
month of May, being the second day of the week, the king
ordered all his fleet to be laden with men, horses, and arms,
and, against the advice of his mariners, entered one of his
long ships, hoping to be able to sail across ; and although the
wind was unfavourable, he refused to return. The other ships,
however, remained in harbour, while the king and those with
him were tossed about on the waves ; for there was a mighty
tempest, and their hearts became fearful. On the following
day, the king returned to the Isle of Wight, and then to
Portsmouth. After a stay there and in that county of eight
days, on the ninth day, being the fifth day of the week, and
the feast of Saint Nereus, and Saint Achilleus, and Saint
Pancratius, the Martyrs, he again embarked on board of his
ships with his army, and passed over to Normandy, and
landed at Harfleur with a hundred large ships, laden with war-
riors, horses, and arms : on which he immediately hastened to
Verneuil, to which the king of France had laid siege. On hearing
of his approach, the king of France, without the knowledge of
his army, left the siege of Verneuil on the vigil of Pentecost, after
having made a stay there of eighteen days at the siege. In the

meantime, John, earl of Mortaigne, the king's brother, returned
to the king his brother, and through the mediation of queen
Eleanor, their mother, the king and he became reconciled :
but the king refused to restore to him any castle or lands. As
to the army of the king of Prance, which he had left besieging
Verneuil, on seeing that their king had taken his departure,
his troops followed him on Monday, in the week of Pentecost.

The king of England, being full of activity, and more swift
than the discharge of a Balearic sling, on hearing that the king
of France was laying siege to Verneuil, hurried on to that
place with all haste, and on not finding the king of France
there, pursued his retreating army with the edge of the sword.
The king of England then hastened to Verneuil, and fortified
the parts that were most unprotected. After so doing, the
king hastened to Montmirail, to which the people of Anjou
and Maine were laying siege ; but, before he arrived, they had
taken it and levelled it with the ground.

The king of England next hastened with all speed to the
castle of Loches, passing by the castle of Tours, where he re-
ceived two thousand marks from the burgesses as a volun-
tary gift. The knights of Navarre, however, and the Bra-
banters, laid siege to the castle of Loches. The chieftain
and leader of these was Aufuns, son of Sancho, king of Na-
varre, and brother of Berengaria, queen of England ; but he
did not lead them as far as Loches, for, before he had arrived
there, word was brought to him that his father, the king of
Navarre, was dead ; for which reason he returned to his coun-
try, and was received as king by the people of that kingdom.

On the king of England arriving before the castle of Loches,
he there found the before-mentioned Navarrese and Brabanters,
amid watchings, and hunger, and other hardships, labouring
in vain at the capture of that castle : on which, immediately
with his own men and the others who were there, making as-
saults upon it day and night, he at length took it by force of
arms, and captured in it five knights and four-and- twenty men-
at-arms, on the second day of the week after the feast of Saint
Barnabas the Apostle.

In the meantime, messengers from the king of France ap-
pointed a conference with the seneschal, and constable, and
nobles of Normandy, at Pont d' Arches. Accordingly, on the
day appointed, "Walter, archbishop of Eouen, together with
the said seneschal, constable, and nobles, came to the place ap-



326 AiraALS OF ROGER DE HOVEDEX. A.D. 1194.



pointed for the conference, and with them awaited the arrival
of envoys from the king of France ; but to no purpose. The
king of France, with no small army, came before a small
castle, four miles distant from Rouen, called Fontaines, and
laid siege to it ; and after labouring at the siege for four days,
more than could be conceived, he at length took it, and it was
levelled with the ground.

In the meantime, earl John, the brother of the king of Eng-
land, with Robert, earl of Leicester, and many other barons, had
met at Rouen ; but as they had no one under whose guidance
in especial to act as they would under our lord the king, and
because they were much inferior in numbers and strength to
the king of France, they did not dare attack that king. But
when the king of France had destroyed the above-mentioned
castle, and was on his road thence, he found the earl of Leicester
off his guard ; he having gone forth from Rouen by night for
the purpose of laying an ambush against him, and made a
rash sally into the lands of Hugh de Gournay for the purpose
of laying them waste ; upon which, with a few of his men,
he was made prisoner by the king of France.

After this, by the common consent of both kings, William,
archbishop of Rheims, the count de Severs, the count de Bar,
master Anselm, the dean of Tours, and many others, on behalf
of the king of France, and Walter, archbishop of Rouen, and
seneschal and constable of Normandy, and many others, on
behalf of the king of England, met near the Yal Rodol, on the
sixth day of the week after the feast of Saint Barnabas the
Apostle, for the purpose of making a truce between the said
kings. Accordingly, after a long deliberation held between
them, they at length agreed to the following terms :

The king of England (it being in nowise against the will of
the king of France) was to hold all the lands that he then held
in his own hands, and in like manner the king of France was
to hold in peace the castles which he had taken or then held ;
and, in the meantime, they were each to be at liberty to fortify
and strengthen all the fortresses which whole and unhurt he
then held in his hands ; but those that had been destroyed,
neither was in the meantime to be at liberty to rebuild. But
if any other person besides them should wish, in rebuilding his
castle, to build houses that had been destroyed or burnt, he
was to be at liberty unmolested to make all provision for him-
self, either in erecting buildings, or in getting in crops of

corn, or other fruits of the earth. It was also agreed that all
churches and ecclesiastical persons who, by the ravages of the
said war, had been deprived of their property or incomes,
everywhere throughout the territories of both kings, should
have full compensation made them.

But, because the king of France wished that all those who
had adhered to him or to the king of England should be in-
cluded in the said truce, so as to receive molestation from
neither of them, as also, that no one of those who had changed
sides, should be subject to hostile proceedings, the truce was
broken off. For the king of England was unwilling to violate
the customs and laws of Poitou, or of any other of his terri-
tories, in which, from ancient times, it had been the custom
of the nobles to settle their own disputes with the sword.

Accordingly, the matter being broken off, they all separated
who had begun the said conference, and from that day the
said kings became still more hostile, and with greater violence
made attacks on each other with ravages and excessive confla-
grations. The king of France came to the city of Evreux, and
utterly destroyed it, and levelled its churches, sparing neither
age nor sex, and carrying off the relics of the saints. This he
did because the citizens of Evreux, having left him, had re-
turned to their duty and allegiance to their lord the king of
England. After the king of France, having destroyed the city
of Evreux, was on his departure thence, and had appeared before
a town called Freteval, the king of England came to Yendome,
to lie in wait for him ; and, as that place was not surrounded
by a wall, or suited for defence, the king ordered his tents to be
pitched outside the town ; and in them he awaited the approach
of the king of France, who had sent him word that that day he
would visit him with a hostile band, as unconcernedly as if he
had been shut up within walls. The king of England joyously
receiving his message, sent word back to him that he would
wait for him, and, if he should not come, would pay him a
visit on the following morning. On the king of France hear-
ing this, he did not visit the king of England that day.

Accordingly, early next morning, the king of England or-
dered his troops to arm, and went forth for the purpose of en-
gaging with the army of the king of France : on hearing of
which, the king of France and his army fled before the face
of the king of England, who pursued them ; and, in the flight,
many of the troops of the king of France were slain, and many



328 ANNALS OF KOGEE DE HOVEJDEtf. A.D. 1194.

taken prisoners. Vast treasure of the king of France was also
taken, with the furniture of the king's chapel, and the papers
of all the subjects of the king of England who had deserted
him and become adherents of the king of France and earl John.

In the flight, however, the king of France left the multitude
and entered a certain church, at a distance from the high road,
for the purpose of hearing mass ; but the king of England, not
knowing that the king of France had concealed himself, still pur-
sued his course, breathing forth threats and slaughter against
the men of the king of France, and sought him, that he might
either put him to death or take him alive.

Being informed by a certain Fleming that the king of
France had now got to a considerable distance, the king of
England was deceived thereby, and proceeded on a horse of the
greatest swiftness a little beyond the territories of France and
Normandy; on which his horse failing him, Marcades, the
chief of his Brabanters, gave him another horse. However, the
Jang of England, not meeting with the king of France, re-
turned to Vendome with a vast amount of booty in prisoners,
and horses, and large sums of money. After this, the king
proceeded to Poitou, to attack Geoifrey de Eancon and the vis-
count d'Angouleine, who had gone over to the king of France
and earl John against him, and he defeated them : on which,
he wrote to Hubert, archbishop of Canterbury, to the following
effect :

"Kichard, by the grace of God, king of England, duke of
Normandy and Aquitaine, and earl of Anjou, to the venerable
father in Christ, Hubert, by the same grace, archbishop of
Canterbury, primate of all England, greeting. Know that, by
the grace of God, who in all things has consideration for the
right, we have taken Tailleburge and Marcilliac, and all the
castles and the whole of the territories of Geoffrey de Eancon,
as also the city of Angouleme, and Neufchatel, Munciniac,
La Chese, and all the other castles, and the whole of the
territories of the viscount of Angouleme, with all things
thereto appendant and appurtenant. The city of Angouleme
and the borough we took in a single evening ; while on the lands
which we have captured in these parts, we have taken full three
hundred knights and forty thousand armed men. "Witness,
myself, at Angouleme, on the twenty-second day of July."

In the meantime, some members of the household of the
king of France and of that of the king of England, by the



A.D. 1194. LETTER OF DROGO, ANSELM, AXD URSIX. 329

consent of both kings, met between Vernueil and Tillers, for the
purpose of a conference, in order to treat upon a truce between
them ; on which an agreement was made between them upon
the terms hereafter stated.

The Letter of Drogo and Anselm on the truce made letween the
kings of France and England.

" Drogo de Merlot, constable of France, Anselm, dean of
Saint Martin at Tours, and Ursin, chamberlain of our lord the
king of France, to all to whom these present letters shall come,
greeting. Know ye, that, by command of our lord Philip,
king of France, we have made oath, and have, as his envoys,
by our hand pledged our faith, that our lord the king of France
shall observe the truce as here underwritten, and the covenants
of the said truce. Now, the said truce has been made on the
following terms : Our lord the king of France, God so dis-
posing him, at the prayers of the cardinal and of the abbat of
Cisteux, grants to the king of England and his people a truce,
and further grants that he may, if he shall be so disposed, for-
tify Meubourg, Driencourt, Concas, and Breteuil. The other
fortresses which were dismantled in the war, either by the
king of France or by their own people, shall not be repaired
during the time of this truce, unless it shall so happen that
they are repaired during a peace which shall be made between
the king of France and the king- of England. The king of
France and his people shall be in all respects in the same posi-
tion as to their tenures in which theV were on the day on which
the truce was made. As to the Yal^Jlodol, the following shall
be the terms agreed on : The king of prance shall hold the Val
Kodol in such manner as he has hitherto done, that is to say,
Ilodol itself, and the whole of that town, with the churches ;
also Lovers, Aquigenere, Laire, and the other places as far as
Haie Malherbe, and as far as Pont d' Arches. But from Haie
Malherbe and beyond, and from Pont d' Arches and beyond,
shall belong to the king of England. Also, as to all the for-
tresses which the king of France shall hold on the day of
this truce, it shall be agreed as follows : the king of France
shall, during the continuance of the truce, fortify, or destroy,
or burn the same if he shall think fit; and he shall be at liberty
to act according to his will and pleasure as to all the lands
which he holds. The king of England shall in like manner
fortify, or destroy, or burn all the fortresses which ho shall



330 ANXALS OF BOGEE DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1194.

hold on the day of this truce; but the king of England
shall not be at liberty to fortify any one of the fortresses that
have been dismantled by the king of France or by his own
people, with the exception of those four which have been men-
tioned above. Further, the king of Prance includes in this
truce all those who before the war were more liegemen of him-
self than of the king of England ; as also these [places] which
were [held by] vassals of the king of England, whom we will
here name : Arches, and Driencourt, as the king himself now
holds the same and his people ; the county of Auge, as he now
holds the same and his people ; Mortemer, and the lands which
William de Chahou holds ; the lands of the earl of Boulogne,
which he held on the day on which the truce was made ;
Hugh de Gournay, and Aumarle, and the feud of Beauvais
and its lands, as he now holds the same ; Neumarche and
the lands thereof, as William de Garland and his people now
hold the same ; Gisors, and Vexin, in Normandy, as the king
of France and his people now hold the same; Yernon and Gal-
lon, and the lands thereto belonging, as the king of France
and his people now hold the same ; Pascy and the lands thereto
belonging, as the king and his people now hold the same ; Hers
and Marcilliac, and the lands thereto belonging, as the king
and his people now hold the same ; Loy and the lands thereto
belonging, as the king and his people now hold the same ; No-
vancourt and the lands thereto belonging, as the king, and earl
Eobert, and his people, now hold the same ; Thiellerie and the
lands thereto belonging, as the king, and Gervaise, and their
people, now hold the same ; Nevelon and his people, and Fret-
teval and the lands thereto belonging, as they now hold the
same ; the count of Bruttie, and his people and lands, if he has
any, as he now holds the same ; the count of Angouleme, and
his people, his lands, and his fee, as he now holds the same;
also, John de Rouvere, Baldwin de Aquigny, and the count
of Mellent, and his lands, as he now holds the same : both
the lands aforesaid, as also the people that are upon them ;
and the said truce shall remain in force for one year from the
feast of All Saints next ensuing. The king of France has men-
tioned all the persons aforesaid by name, because he wishes
the king of England to mention by name those men of con-
sequence whom he shall wish to be comprehended in the truce,
within a period of fifteen days from the said truce : for if, after
the fifteenth day from the said truce being made, he shall wish
to naine any, the king of France will decline to include them ;



A.D. 1194. LETTER OF EROGO, AtfSELM, AND URSLtf. 331

and if they shall confess that they have aided the king of Eng-
land, they shall be included in the truce. All supporters of
either side within fortified places shall also be included in the
truce. The king of France has chosen two arbitrators, and, in
like manner, the king of England two, by whose award, or by
that of the greater part of them, if either of the kings shall take
anything from the other, or any one of their subjects shall do
so, reparation shall be made for the same within forty days
therefrom. And the said arbitrators shall make oath on the
holy Evangelists, that they will neither for love, hate, fear,
nor reward, be guilty of any omission, but will with good faith
make their award. And if it shall so happen that any seizure
shall be made beyond the Loire, in the direction of Bourges,
then the arbitrators shall meet between Exodun, and Chateau
Raoul, for the purpose of compensation being made, and the
arbitrators of the territory in which the seizure shall have been
made shall summon the other arbitrators ; and they, on hearing
the summons, shall with good faith meet on fitting days at one
of the places above named ; and if any seizure shall happen to
be made on this side the Loire, in the direction of Normandy,
then the arbitrators shall meet between Vernueil and Tiliers,
for the purpose of compensation being made. And if there
shall happen to be any misunderstanding between the arbi-
trators, then. Master the legate of the highest standing, 19 shall,
with good faith and at peril of his soul, enquire into the truth
thereof, and shall pronounce upon him who shall refuse to
make satisfaction for the seizure and the offence, sentence of
excommunication, all right of appeal being withdrawn, and
shall place his lands under interdict. But it' the evildoer shall
belong to the territory of the king of France, then the king of
France shall, in good faith, aid in obtaining reparation for
the same, without any loss to himself ; and the king of England
shall do the same, in good faith, as to his subjects. If the
king of France shall make any aggression upon the king of
England, or the king of England upon the king of France,
then the cardinal shall place an interdict upon the lands of the
party making the aggression, if he shall refuse to make amends
for such aggression, at the award of the arbitrators, or the major
part of them. Richard, king of England, and his people, shall
hold their lands on this side the Loire, towards Normandy, in
the same manner in which they were holding them on the day
19 The legate of France or of Normandy.

on which the truce was made, and beyond the Loire they shall
hold' them in the same manner in which they held them on
the day on which he and his people were able, within so many
lawful days, to hear of the truce being made. 20 The king of
England includes in the truce all those who were more liege-
men of himself than of the king of France before the truce.
As to the prisoners, it shall be thus agreed on both sides : those
prisoners whom the king of France detains, shall be rescued
upon giving such security as they shall offer, if it shall so
please the said king ; but if it shall not please him, then his
arbitrators shall upon oath declare what security shall be
given in addition thereto, in order that the king of France
may be secure that the prisoner will return to the custody
of the king of France fifteen days before the end of the truce,
if the prisoner is then alive ; and the same shall be done
as to the prisoners of the king of England by his arbitrators.
All these things both kings shall swear to observe with
good faith, and shall make oath at the hand of the cardinal;
and they shall give their letters patent as to keeping and observ-
ing the aforesaid truce and covenants. Before us, on part of
the king of France, Gervaise de Chatillon has made oath and
sworn, on behalf of the king of France, that this truce shall
be observed ; such persons also shall make oath, both clergy as
well as laity, subject to the arbitration of the umpires, as
the king of England shall require. In addition to which, be
it known to you that we who have sworn to this agreement
for a truce, have hereupon had letters patent on behalf of the
king of France for the confirmation of the same, expressing
that whatever we shall ordain as to observing the truce, that
same he will ratify and confirm. Done between Vernueil and
Tiliers, in the year from the Word made Incarnate one thousand
one hundred and ninety-four, on the twenty-third day of July."
After the king had crossed over, on Hugh, bishop of Dur-
ham, returning home, Hugh Bardolph demanded of him the
earldom of Northumberland, JSTewcastle-upon-Tyne, and the
castle of Bamborough, which the said bishop had promised
to the king that he would deliver up. However, the bishop
delayed doing this, because his messenger, by whom he had
made offer to the king of two thousand marks of silver for
retaining the said earldom and the above-mentioned castles,
had not yet returned. When he returned, he brought with
20 Probably a certain distance being reckoned for each lawful day.



A.D. 1194. APPEAL OF THE CAXONS OF YOKE. 333

him a letter from the king, by which the king informed Hugh
Bardolph that if the said bishop of Durham should give him
security for the payment of the said two thousand marks, he
was to deliver to the said bishop the before-named earldom,
together with the castles.

On the king's letter being delivered to Hugh Bardolph, he
accordingly made answer to Hugh, bishop of Durham, say-
ing: "If you wish me to act according to the king's com-
mands, deliver up to me the castles and the earldom, and I
will re-deliver them to you, as the king has commanded, if
you give me security for the receipt of these two thousand
marks, on behalf of the king." To this the bishop of Dur-
ham replied : " There is no need for me to deliver them to
you to deliver them to me again, as I have got them, and
hold them in my possession." On hearing this, Hugh Bar-
dolph immediately sent word to our lord the king, what answer
he had received from the bishop ; at which the king being
incensed, ordered the bishop of Durham to be disseised of
the castles and the earldom above-mentioned, and the two
thousand marks to be demanded of him. The king also,
in the fury of his anger, ordered the bishop of Durham to be
dispossessed of the manor of Sedbergh, with the knight's fees
and wapentake which the said king had given to Saint Cuth-
bert and the Church of Durham, and the said bishop, as a pure
and perpetual alms-gift, and by his charter had confirmed the
same, in manner previously stated; which was accordingly done.

In the meantime, the canons of the church of York, making
complaint to the archbishop of Canterbury, the king's jus-
ticiary, of the injuries that had been done them by the arch-
bishop of York, the archbishop of Canterbury, by the royal
authority with which he was invested, sent to York, earl
Roger Bigot, William de Warenne, "William de Stuteville,
Hugh Bardolph, William Bruyere, Geoffrey Habet, and Wil-
liam Fitz-Richard, a clerk, to hear the dispute between the
archbishop of York and his canons, and to settle the same
as justice should require. Having accordingly come thither,
and heard the appeals of the canons, and the answer of the
archbishop and his adherents, they ordered the men of the
archbishop who had been charged with robbery, to be seized
and thrown into prison. And although the archbishop was
ready to give his warranty for what they had done, he
still was unable to bail them. After this, they summoned






334 ANXALS OF EOGER DE HOVEDEX. A.D. 1194.

the archbishop to come and receive their judgment, and, be-
cause he refused, they dispossessed him of all his manors, with
the sole exception of the manor of Rip on, to which the arch-
bishop had retired ; after which, they caused the canons to be
reinstated in their stalls of which the archbishop had dispos-
sessed them. On their departure, they appointed William de
Stuteville, and Geoffrey Haget, to exercise supervision in York-
shire over the archbishop and his shrievalty.

Shortly after, in the month of September, justices itinerant
Were sent in the king's behalf throughout each of the counties

stood that those who hold the said Wardships and Escheats
to farm, shall, after the feast of Saint Michael, answer for
the same thenceforward as for farms in husbandry. And
as for those who shall hold the said Wardships and Escheats
to farm, our lord the king shall give them warranty for
the same from year to year until the termination thereof;
so that, although our lord the king should give any of them
to any person, the farmer shall still hold his farm, to hold
the same by farm till the end of the year, by paying to

him to whom our lord the king shall have so given it, the rent
which shall be due from him for the same until the end of the
year. The right to the escheat, however, which he shall have
so given is to remain with our lord the king, unless our lord
the king shall have given it by name. The farmer, when he
shall give up his farm, is to have all his stock which he shall
have placed upon the farm, and all his property over and above
the property of the king there, freely and without diminution.
They shall also have letters patent of our lord the archbishop,
containing the tenor of the charter of our lord the king made
relative thereto.

Most diligent enquiry shall also be made what is the rental
assessed upon each manor in demesne, and the value of all
other assessments in the said manors, and how many caru-
cates there are, and how much they are each worth, not
estimating them at a fixed value of twenty shillings only, 22
but, according as the land is good or bad, whether the value is
likely to increase or decrease. Those persons who shall take
these farms shall stock their farms as already mentioned, ac-
cording to the sum named as to the revenues of the escheats
and wardships. Enquiry is also to be made with how many
oxen and plough horses each carucate ought to be stocked ;
and how much stock, and to what amount each manor is able
to support ; and the result thereof is then to be speedily and
distinctly reduced to writing. The price set upon a bull shall
be four shillings, and upon a cow the same, upon a plough-
horse the same, upon a sheep with fine wool ten pence, upon
a sheep with coarse wool six pence, upon a sow twelve pence,
and upon a boar twelve pence ; and when the farmers give
up their farms they shall be answerable in the aforesaid sums,
or in animals payable for the same, at the option of the farm-
ers ; and when all the aforesaid stock shall be placed thereon
and duly valued, they shall all be enrolled openly and dis-
tinctly, and the register thereof shall be deposited in the ex-
chequer. From this assize are to be excepted bishoprics and
abbeys, and lands of barons who are nearly of age. Also, let
enquiry previously be made, by the oath of the parties aforesaid,
as to all wardships and escheats which are not in the hands of

22 Probably the rental of each carucate, or plough land of one hundred
acres, was assessed at twenty shillings, for the purpose of collecting the
carucage or land tax levied thereon.

our lord the king, and they are to be taken possession of by
our lord the king, and dealt with as other lands and escheats.

Heads as to the Jews.

All debts and pledges of Jews are to be enrolled, as also
their lands, houses, rents, and possessions. Any Jew who
shall make concealment of any one of these things, shall for-
feit to our lord the king his body, as also the thing concealed,
and all his possessions, and all has chattels ; and no Jew shall
ever be allowed to recover what he has so concealed. Also,
let six or seven places be appointed at which they shall make
their loans, and let two lawful Christians and two lawful Jews
and two lawful scribes be appointed, and in their presence, and
in that of the clerks of William of the Church of Saint Mary
and of William de Chimelli, let such loans be made, and let a
deed describing the loan be made, after the manner of an inden-
ture. One part ^ is to remain in the hands of the Jew, sealed
with his seal to whom the money is paid, while the other part
is to remain in the common chest ; on which there are to be
three locks ; whereof the two Christians are to keep one key,
the two Jews another, and the clerks of William of the Church
of Saint Mary and of Master William de Chimelli the third ;
as also three seals, those who have the keys setting thereon
their seals. The clerks also of the two Williams aforesaid are
"to have a register containing copies of all the deeds, and as
the deeds are altered so shall the register be altered. For
each deed shall be paid three pence ; a moiety thereof by the
Jew, and a moiety by him to whom the money is lent ; of which
the two scribes are to have two pence, and the keeper of the
register the third: and, for the future, no loan shall be
made, no payment made to Jews, no alteration of the deeds,
except in presence of the persons aforenamed, or the major
part of them, if all shall be unable to be present. The said
two Christians also are to have a register of receipts for pay-
ments made henceforth to Jews, and the two Jews are to have
one, and the keeper of the register one. Also, every Jew shall
make oath upon his register that he will cause all his debts,
pledges, rents, and all his property and possessions to be en-
rolled, and that, as above stated, he will not conceal anything ;
and that, if he shall be able to learn that any one has con-
cealed anything, he will secretly disclose the same to the

judges sent to them, and that forgers of deeds and clippers
of money, when he shall know of such persons, he will give
information against, and detect the same, and the like with re-
gard to the deeds so forged.

Also, inquisition shall be made relative to the holdings of
and seizures made by all bailiffs of the king, both justices as
well as sheriffs, and constables, and foresters and their servants,
since the time of the first coronation of our lord king Eichard,
and why such seizures were made, and by whom; and of all the
chattels, gifts, and promises made on the occasion of seizure
of the lands of earl John and his supporters; and who re-
ceived the same, and what they were, and what delay was
caused by command of Hubert, archbishop of Canterbury, at
that time the king's chief justice."

In the meantime, Eichard, king of England, having settled
his affairs in Poitou to his satisfaction, returned to Anjou, and
fined all his bailiffs, that is to say, forced them to pay a fine ;
and did the same in Maine. After this, he came into Normandy,
and was vexed with what had been done in relation, to the
truce above-mentioned, and imputing it to his chancellor that
this had been done through his agency, took away from him
his seal, and caused a new seal to be made, and had pro-
clamation made throughout all his territories, that nothing
would be held as ratified that had been done by means of
his old seal, both because his chancellor had wrought more in-
discreetly with it than was becoming, as also because that
seal had been lost when Eoger Malchine, his vice-chancellor,
was drowned at sea, before the island of Cyprus. The king
also gave orders that all persons who had charters should come
to renew the same with the new seal.

The king also ordered tournaments to be held in England,
and by his charter confirmed the same ; upon condition that
whoever should wish to tourney, should pay him a sum accord-
ing to the terms underwritten, namely ; an earl was to give,
for permission to tourney twenty marks of silver, a baron ten
marks of silver, a knight, holding land, four marks of silver,
and a knight, not a landholder, two marks of silver ; and the
king gave orders that no knight should come near the places
where the tournaments were held unless he had first paid him
the said sum of money. The charter of this grant the king
delivered into the custody of William, earl of Salisbury;
and Hubert Fits-Walter, the king's chief justice, appointed

his brother, Theobald Pitz- Walter, to be collector of this
money.

In the same year, Koger, the son of Tancred, king of Sicily,
whom his father had caused to be crowned king of Sicily, and
who had married the daughter of Tursac, emperor of Con-
stantinople, departed this life ; after whose decease, king
Tancred caused his son William, brother of the said king
Iloger, to be crowned king of Sicily. Shortly after this, the
said Tancred died : on hearing of which, Henry, emperor of
the Eomans, assembling a large army, entered Apulia in the
beginning of the month of August, and subdued it, and, fifteen
days before the feast of Saint Michael, took Salerno by storm ;
and because the people of Salerno had behaved treacherously
towards him, as above stated, in delivering the empress Con-
stance into the hands of king Tancred, to avenge the said be-
trayal he either put to death all the more powerful citizens of
that city, or else condemned them to exile, and put up their
wives and children for sale to his troops. He also found in the
great Tower there a large treasure, valued at two hundred
thousand ounces of gold, and his army was enriched by the
spoils of the 'people of Salerno. After this, the emperor pro-
ceeded to the city of Amain, which was immediately surren-
dered to him ; and, while he was staying there, all the cities
of Apulia w r ere surrendered to him, three of which he levelled
with the ground Salerno, Spinchola, and Polichore.

Before the feast of All Saints, he came to the city of Mes-
sina, in Sicily, with such honor and glory, that it had never
been heard of any person entering that territory with greater
honor and glory. Here he was honorably received by the
archbishops, bishops, earls, and barons of the kingdom of
Sicily, and departing thence proceeded to Palermo; having
arrived at which place, the queen of Sicily, formerly the wife
of king Tancred, and Richard de Theme, her brother, surren-
dered to him the palace of the king of Sicily, as also, king
William, son of king Tancred, the widow of king Iloger,
daughter of Tursac, emperor of Constantinople, and the king's
treasure of gold and silver inexhaustible, which the kings of
Sicily had laid up. After this, all the cities and fortresses of
the kingdom of Sicily were delivered up to him, and the ad-
miral Margarite surrendered to him the castle at the port of
Palermo, on which the emperor gave him the dukedom of Du-
razzo, the principality of Tarento, and the principality of La



A. D. 1194. SWEHE CROWNED KING OF NORWAY. 341

Mare. There also came to the before-named emperor of the
Romans all the pagans and Jews who were in the kingdom of
Sicily, and, paying him certain sums, remained in the king-
dom of Sicily, each in his own place, in the same condition in
which he had been before.

The emperor then caused himself and the empress Constance,
his wife, to be crowned at the city of Palermo, in presence
and with the consent of the archbishops, bishops, and princi-
pal men of the kingdom. The emperor then caused the bodies
of king Tancred and king Eoger, his son, to be disinterred, and
spoiled them of their crowns and sceptres, and other royal
ornaments, saying that they were not kings by right, but
rather usurpers of the throne, and holders thereof by violence.
The emperor next gave in marriage to Philip, his brother, duke
of Suabia, the above-mentioned daughter of Tursac, emperor
of Constantinople, and put out the eyes of king William, son
of king Tancred, and had him emasculated.

In the same year, the citizens of Borne elected fifty- six sena-
tors, and placed them in authority over themselves : whereas,
previously, they had had but a single senator, whose name
was Benedict, a worthy man, who had ruled over them two
years, and after him they had had another senator, who was
called John Capuche, and had similarly reigned over them an-
other two years ; in whose times Borne was better governed than
at the present day, in the time of the fifty- six senators.

In the same year, Swere, prince of Norway, contrary to the
prohibition of our lord the pope, had himself crowned king of
Norway ; on hearing of which, Eustace, archbishop of Droii-
theim, chose rather to go into exile than be present at his co-
ronation ; he accordingly departed, and the said Swere, son
of Siward, king of Norway, gave orders that all the bishops of
Norway should meet together at Bergen, on the feast of the
Apostles Saint Peter and Saint Paul, for the purpose of crown-
ing him. Among these was the bishop of Wie, whose name
was Nicholas. He declared that he was unwilling to be present
at the coronation, because of the absence of the archbishop ; on
hearing which, Swere caused the bishop to be seized, and to
be bound on the sea- shore on a small eminence, so that the
waves of the sea, flowing on, nearly entered his mouth ; upon
which, the bishop being terrified, assented to the wishes of
Swere Birkebain, and crowned and consecrated him king at
Bergen, on the feast of the Apostles Saint Peter and Saint Paul,



342 AXNALS OF ROGEB DE HOVEDEX. A.D. 1194.

the bishops, Martin of Bergen, Eric of Stavangre, Thore of
Burgunde, 24 and Absalom, being present and assenting thereto.
On the same day, when the said Swere, the king and priest,
was dining in regal state with the bishops and principal men of
his kingdom, he caused the head of Si ward, the son of Adestan,
the former king of Norway, to be cut off, and to be brought
before him and his guests, as they sat at table. It is worthy
of remark that this Swere Birkebain conquered fifteen kings in
fifteen naval battles, and slew them, with all their followers,
before he was able to secure the crown ; their names were as
follows, king Magnus, king Borgher, king Siward, king
Ordus, king Guthrum, king John Cuvelung, king Belue, king
Zether, and six others, with the above Siward, son of Adestan.
It also deserves to be known, that it is the custom of the
kingdom of Norway to the present day that every one who
is known to be the son of any king of Norway, although ille-
gitimate, and the issue of a bondwoman, has equal right to
lay claim to the kingdom of Norway with the son of a king
legally married, and being the son of a free woman ; the con-
sequence of which is, that there are battles going on between
them without ceasing, until one of them is conquered and
slain.

The same year, a little before the feast of Saint Michael,
there came to York, Hamo, praecentor of the church of York,
Geoffrey de Muschamp, archdeacon of Cleveland, and Master
William Testard, archdeacon of Nottingham, who had gone to
Rome with Master Simon of Apulia, and Ralph, the arch-
deacon of the West Riding, relative to the injuries which
Geoffrey, archbishop of York, had inflicted on them and their
fellow-canons, he having excommunicated them and all who
held communion with them, and, on their appeal to the Su-
preme Pontiff, laid an interdict on their churches. They
also brought with them letters of absolution both from the
excommunication and the interdict, and letters for the re-
stitution of what had been taken from them ; undertaking the
execution of which at the mandate of pope Celestinus, Hugh,
bishop of Durham, came to York, and on Saint Michael's day
celebrated mass in the mother church there, declaring be-
fore the clergy and the people, that the sentence which Geof-
frey, archbishop of York, had pronounced upon his canons
and those holding communion with them was null and void.

LETTEK OF EICHARD, KINO OF ENGLAND. 343

But Ralph, the archdeacon of the West Riding, died while on
his return from Rome; on which, Geoffrey, archbishop of
York, gave his archdeaconry, first, to his own brother, Peter,
and afterwards to Peter de Nunant. The said archbishop
then making appeal against his canons and their acquisitions,
crossed over from England, to Normandy, to Richard, king of
England, his brother, and obtained from him a letter to the
following effect :

The Letter of Richard, Icing of England, on the reconciliation of
the archbisho-p of York,

" Richard, by the grace of God, king of England, duke of
Normandy and Aquitaine, and earl of Anjou, to his dearly
beloved and faithful subjects, William of the Church of Saint
Mary, and Hugh Bardolph, greeting. We do hereby inform
you, that Geoffrey, archbishop of York, our brother, has come
to us, and over and above those thousand marks which he
paid us in England, has done our will as to the other thousand
marks ; and, as he has informed us by a certain person,
would willingly have before this made satisfaction for the
debt if he had been able so to do, and has long been greatly
vexed that he has thus long delayed so to do. Accordingly,
we have received him into our favour and protection, and
have granted him in the fullest manner our kind interest
in his behalf. We have also sent our messenger to Eng-
land with his messenger, to the end that he may see in what
way he makes satisfaction to us for the remaining thou-
sand marks ; for he has made a promise to us that he will
satisfy us thereupon as soon as he possibly can. Wherefore
we do command you to make restitution to him of his lands
and all his property in full, without delay ; and whatever of his
rentals or of his property shall have been sold on account of
the said debt, whatever of the same we have had, you are
reasonably to set off the same against the residue of his debt ;
and if any part thereof shall have been sold at a less price
than it ought, either through love or hatred for any person,
you are to cause reparation to be made for the same by those
who have so done, and the same to be credited to the arch-
bishop on account of his debt. His men also who have been
taken or detained, both clergy as well as laity, you are to
cause to be held on bail and set at liberty without delay, ac-
cording to the custom of England. Also, you are not to allow



344 ANNALS OF ROGER DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1194.

the lay power to disturb him in exercising his right of ec-
clesiastical censure throughout the whole of his archiepis-
copate, as in reason he ought. You are also to compel the
men of Beverley to make good the injuries they have done
him, and to do towards him what they are bound to do,
and what they have been accustomed to do to his predeces-
sors. Witness myself, at Mamerz, on the third day of No-
vember."

The said archbishop of York also obtained another letter
from our lord the king to the following effect :

" Richard, by the grace of God, king of England, duke of
Normandy and Aquitaine, and earl of Anjou, to "William, of
the Church of Saint Mary, and Hugh Bardolph, greeting.
Know ye, that we have learned, that at the time of the death
of our father, without our command and consent, Geoffrey de
Muschamp obtained letters under his seal to hold the arch-
deaconry of Cleveland ; and William de Stigandby and Master
Erard, similarly obtained letters to hold prebendal stalls in
the church of York, which were then vacant, and at our dis-
posal. Wherefore, we do command you, without delay, to
deprive the persons aforesaid of the archdeaconry, and the
said prebends, and exact from them whatever they have re-
ceived, since they have so fraudulently and surreptitiously
gained possession of the said revenues. Witness myself, at
Mamerz, on the third day of November."

Oh shameful disgrace ! " 'Tis base for the censurer to be
himself convicted of the fault." 25 For the said archbishop,
while still chancellor of the king, his father, had that seal
in his own possession ; by means of which the said arch-
deaconry and those prebendal stalls had been given to the per-
sons before-named.

In the same year, John Belesme, archbishop of Lyons sur
Rhone, resigned his archbishopric ; and, being content with a
revenue of one hundred pounds sterling belonging to the arch-
bishopric of Lyons, lived an unspotted life, pleasing to God
and man, to the end of his existence, in the house of Clairval.

In the same year, while Leopold, duke of Austria, was still
remaining under the sentence of excommunication which our
lord the pope had pronounced upon him for the captivity of
Richard, king of England and, not repenting thereof, the Lord

25 " Turpe est doctori, cum culpa redarguit ipsum." The reason for his
saying this, is shown in the following lines.



A.D. 1195. HEXET CEOWNED KING OF SICILY. 345

scourged his territories in the following manner. In the first
place, all of the cities of his dominions were destroyed by
fire, and yet the cause of none of these fires was known. In
the second place, the adjoining country was overflowed by an
inundation of the river Danube, in which ten thousand per-
sons or more perished. In the third place, whereas all the
earth in the middle of summer ought to, and usually does, pos-
sess vitality, at that period the whole of his territory, contrary
to the usual and ordinary course of things, became parched
up. In the fourth place, when the seeds of corn ought to have
shot up into blade, they were changed into worms. In the
fifth place, the most noble persons in his dominions were smit-
ten with a mortality.

Although the Lord had smitten his territory with plagues
so many and so great, he still was unwilling to repent, but his
heart was hardened, so much so, that he took an oath that all
the hostages of the king of England whom he had in his hands
should undergo capital punishment, unless all the covenants
were speedily performed which the king of England had made
with him. Consequently, Baldwin de Bethune, who was one of
those who had been given as hostages to the duke of Austria
for the ransom of the king of England, by the common con-
sent of the hostages, was sent to the king of England to
declare to him the duke's purpose; and, on his arrival, the
king, taking compassion on them, delivered to him the sister of
Arthur, duke of Brittany, and the daughter of the emperor of
Cyprus, to escort to the duke of Austria ; the sister of Ar-
thur for the purpose of being married to the son of the duke
of Austria, and the daughter of the emperor of Cyprus to be
delivered into the hands of the duke.

In the year of grace 1195, being the sixth year of the reign
of Eichard, king of England, the said king Eichard was at
Eouen, in Normandy, on the day of the Nativity of our Lord,
which fell on the Lord's Day, being intent on supplying
himself with all things necessary, in money and men, against
Philip, king of France. For the truce which had been agreed
upon between them as to last until the feast of All Saints
was far from observed, the subjects of both kingdoms making
excessive ravages. On the same day of the Nativity of our
Lord, Henry, emperor of the Eomans, was crowned at Palermo,
in Sicily, with the crown of the kingdom of Sicily.

In the same year, before the Nativity of our Lord, on the



346 ANNALS OF ROGER DE HOVEDEX. A.D. 1195.

day of Saint Stephen the Protomartyr, when the heart of
Leopold, duke of Austria, was hardened, nor could be soft-
ened by means of the plagues previously mentioned which
the Lord inflicted on his territories, the Lord scourged his
body in the following manner. Having convened the elders
of his territory to celebrate the festival of the Nativity of
our Lord, while the said duke was on his road, on Saint
Stephen's day, to take recreation with his knights, his horse
fell upon him and crushed his foot, in such a manner that the
bones, being broken on both sides, projected through the middle
of the skin, and were exposed to the extent of the palm of
one's hand : the surgeons, however, when they came, applied
to the foot what they thought best for it. On the follow-
ing day the foot was found to have turned black, and to be in
such a state that it ought, in the opinion of the surgeons, to be
taken off; but, upon his ordering this to be done, there was
not a person found to acquiesce in his wishes : for no one dared,
or could for sorrow, lay a hand on his master.

At length, he sent for his son and heir, and begged and com-
manded him to cut off his foot, and put an end to his pain ;
and, on his refusal as well, he sent for his chamberlain, who
being compelled so to do, the duke himself, with his own hand,
held an axe close to the bone of the leg, while the chamber-
lain, wielding a mallet, after three blows, with great difficulty,
cut off the foot; the surgeons, however, after applying re-
medies, on visiting him the next day, found in him no hopes of
life. The duke, being consequently reduced to despair, caused
the archbishops, bishops, and great men of his dominions, who
had come to be present at the festival, to be assembled together;
and, on asking to be absolved from the sentence which our
lord the pope had pronounced against him, for the injuries
which he had done to the king of England, was answered by
the whole of the clergy that he could, under no circumstances,
procure absolution, unless, by making oath, he should give secu-
rity that, as to the said injuries, he would abide by the judg-
ment of the Church ; and, unless others of the chief men of
his dukedom should join him in the said oath : and if he should
be overtaken by the common destiny of man, they would use
their exertions in every way that satisfaction might be made
to the Holy Church, in order that the judgment of the Church
might not be carried out with respect to him. Accordingly, being
absolved through means of the j udgment of the Church, he ordered



A. D. 1195. ENQUIRY INTO CASE OF THE AECHBISHOP OF YOEK. 34?

all the hostages of the king of England that he had in his pos-
session to be set at liberty, and forgave the sum of money
owing to him from the king of England. After his decease,
his heir, with some of the nobles, opposed the things before-
mentioned being done ; on which, the clergy would on no
account allow the body of the duke to be buried : consequently,
his body was kept above ground for eight days, until all the
hostages given by the king of England had been set at liberty ;
some of whom, on their coming to England, related all these
things as what they had seen and heard. They also asserted
that, at their departure, there was produced and oifered to them,
four thousand marks and more, money belonging to the king of
England, to be brought back ; but that, on account of the perils
of the journey, they had not dared on any account to take
charge thereof.

All these things were done by God, that He might abase the
haughty, and manifest His power before mortals ; and when
He pursues with His deserved vengeance the injuries done to
Him and His, we are to believe that the same has happened
not only for our sakes, but also to assert His power ; nor must
we boastfully ascribe to ourselves what has been wrought solely
by the mercy of the Lord. In the meantime, when Baldwin
de Bethune had come near the territories of the said duke
of Austria, and heard of his death, he did not proceed any
further, but returned to the king of England, and brought back
the ladies before-named, and restored them to the king.

In the same year, Walter, archbishop of Eouen, gave to
Philip, king of France, one thousand pounds of money Anjouin
for the ransom of his lands, which the said king of France had
taken possession of during the war ; and, at the same time, Ro-
bert, earl of Leicester, offered to Philip, king of France, for his
ransom, one thousand pounds sterling, and to release him from
all claim for ever, by himself and his heirs, to the castle of Passy
with all its appurtenances, and to ask a confirmation of the same
from our lord the pope, and a confirmation from the king of
England. But, as there was not yet an end of the war between
himself and the king of England, he put off for the present the
consideration of the offers which the earl of Leicester had made
him.

In the same year, in the month of January, being the Lord's
Day next after the octave of the Epiphany, Hugh, bishop of
Lincoln, Master Winmer, archdeacon of Northampton, and
Hugh, prior of Pontefract, to whom our lord the pope, Ce-



348 ANNALS OF BOGEB, DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1195.

lestinus, had entrusted the charge of enquiring into the ex-
cesses of which Geoffrey, archbishop of York, was accused by
his canons of the church of York before the pope and cardinals,
arrived at York, and proceeded in conformity with the man-
date of our lord the pope ; which was to the following effect :

The Letter of pope Celestinus, directing an inquisition to le
made into the alleged excesses of the archbishop of York.

" Celestinus, the bishop, servant of the servants of God, to
his venerable brother, the bishop of Lincoln, and his dearly
beloved sons, the archdeacon of Northampton, and the prior of
Pontefract, greeting. Jesus Christ, the mediator between
God and man, whose foresight in His ordinances is not deceived,
has willed that the source of the discipline of the whole
Church, and the direction of the holy Church of Rome should
be reserved for Himself, and that all other [churches] should
also be subject to His government and supervision : that so,
the plenitude of power being expressly reserved unto Him,
it may belong to Him to correct the excesses also of other
[churches], and, with the authority of the Apostolic sway,
approve of what is done in a manner deserving of praise.
Wherefore, inasmuch as by Divine providence we have been
chosen to the governance thereof, it is our wish so to love our
brethren and fellow-bishops, with due considerateness and dis-
cretion, that we may not seem to prefer their affection and
friendship to the duties unto which we are called ; and the
more especially, as love has its limits, and each is bound to
love the man, but not the errors of the man. And whereas,
it has come to our hearing, from the information of the clergy
and the chapter of the church of York, and the testimony of
our dearly beloved sons Robert of York, and Roger of Selby,
and of eleven other abbats of the Praamonstratensian order,
seems manifestly to declare the same, that our venerable bro-
ther, Geoffrey, the archbishop of York, disregarding the oaths
of the office entrusted to him, being uselessly engaged in
hunting, hawking, and other military pursuits, has given
neither hand nor thought since his promotion to the ordina-
tion of the clergy, the dedication of churches, or the cele-
brations of synods, nor yet has pronounced a blessing upon
any abbat, although with sufficient indiscretion he has accus-
tomed his tongue at his own pleasure to pronounce male-
dictions against and to excommunicate both clerks and abbats ;



A. I). 1195. LETTEE OF POPE CELESTIJSTUS. 349

the liberties and approved customs of his church he nullifies
and subverts ; appeals which are wont to be the refuge of the
oppressed, he has, to the injury of the Eoman See, brought into
contempt. Many, because they have made appeals to our-
selves, he has ordered to be thrown into prison and placed in
irons ; the beneficed clergy of his church, after appeal made
to us, he has spoiled of honors and benefices, and some of the
canons, despising their appeal, he had subjected to excom-
munication. In his presence, the privileges of the Koman
Pontiffs are utterly deprived of all authority ; and he, who
otherwise would probably have been safe by pleading our
privileges in his presence, loses the benefit of the protection
he thereby hoped to gain. When it so happens that any one
has been restored to a church or 26 possession by the judges de-
legated by our authority, the person by whom the said judg-
ment is to be put in execution, he immediately looks upon as
an enemy. Indeed, many so restored, he has reduced to des-
titution ; and entering their churches by force, by means of his
servants, is said to have broken down the doors of the churches,
and to have by violent means expelled them. Many persons
also he has perniciously made to incur the danger of perjury,
withdrawing them by means of violent compulsion from the
obedience which by oath they had canonically promised his
archdeacons to observe. Still more, attacking the greater
church with a multitude of armed men, he has caused the
doors of the chapter-house to be broken open by force and
carried away ; the property of the canons, and that of many
other persons who had deposited their possessions in the
church as in a treasury, he has caused by violence to be
withheld from them ; respecting all which matters, the chap-
ter of York has made appeal to our presence. "VVe have also
understood from the testimony of the persons before-named,
that sometimes when churches have been vacant, he has not
admitted fit and proper persons when presented by those to
whom the presentation belongs, but has given the same to
either youths or persons of bad character, thus discharging the
duty both of him who presents and of him who institutes ; or
else at his own sole will he causes them to be vacated, in
order that their revenues may be applied to his own use, and
that which was intended for the sustenance of some worthy
clerk, he does not hesitate to retain in his own hands. They

have also stated in addition, that, whereas spiritual gifts
ought to be bestowed without reward and without corrupt-
ness, frequently, when he gives a benefice, he either splits
it into two parts, contrary to the canonical statutes of the
church, or else retains upon it a new and unusual charge ;
many, too, who have been excommunicated or suspended, he
has absolved, through the intervention of nothing else than
money. In his sight, religious and honest men are despised
and contemned ; while low and suspected persons easily ob-
tain his familiar acquaintanceship and favour. Wherefore, if
such is his mode of life, and among such is his conversation,
it is to be feared lest he may prove to the flock entrusted to
his charge, rather a rock of oifence and a stumbling-block,
than an example of erudition, or a solace or protection against
spiritual wickedness. Wherefore, inasmuch as the things that
have been here stated, demand the care of an enquiry, we
have thought proper to entrust to your discretion, in which
we have full confidence, the enquiry into these matters,
giving you, by these Apostolic writings, our commands forth-
with to repair to the church of York, and, convoking the
abbats, priors, and other ecclesiastical persons of the diocese of
York, to make diligent enquiry whether he has thus negligently
and perniciously treated the church and province of York. And
if, upon the matters above stated, lawful accusers shall come
forward, you are to hear what they shall think proper to
allege against the aforesaid archbishop, and, after diligently
hearing and learning the same, to make it your care to
transmit to us their attestation, enclosed under your seals,
assigning to the parties a fitting time within which, being
sufficiently instructed thereon, they are to appear at the
Apostolic See, there to receive, the Lord so providing, what
is directed by the canons of the Church. If, however, ac-
cusers shall not be forthcoming, and if public report shall be
in his disfavour, then you are, by our authority, to call upon
him to clear himself by [the oaths of] three bishops and as
many abbats, all obstacle of appeal removed. And if he shall
chance to make any default therein, you are to cause him to
be suspended from his archiepiscopal duties and administra-
tion, and to appear in the Apostolical presence, to the end
that, the Lord instructing him, he may there be taught how it
befits him, and those like him, to minister in the house of
the Lord. And if the said archbishop shall think fit to allege



A. D. 1195. EXQUIKYINTO CONDUCT OF THE AECHBISHOP OP YOKE. 351

anything against them, you are to hear the same as well, and
to transmit it to us, enclosed under your seals, in order that a
determination may, in due conformity with the canons, be come
to thereon. Moreover, if the said archbishop shall, for the pur-
pose of eluding our mandate, before your citation shall reach
him, have interposed an appeal, or have commenced his jour-
ney on his way to the Apostolic See, you are to appoint him
a^time within three months, upon which he is to be bound, in
his own person, to appear in our presence. And if he shall
fail so to do, you shall, by our authority, from that period,
pronounce him suspended from all pontifical duties, and from
the administration of the archbishopric, all power of appeal
set aside. And if you shall be unable all of you to take part in
carrying out these instructions, then any two of you shall carry
out the same. Given at Saint Peter's, at Home, on the sixth day
before the ides of June, in the fourth year of our pontificate."
Accordingly, upon the authority of these letters, the said
bishop of Lincoln and his colleagues came to York for the pur-
pose of making the said enquiry, and, having summoned before
them in the cathedral church, the abbats, priors, and ecclesiasti-
cal personages of the diocese of York, proceeded, according to the
tenor of this Apostolic mandate, to make diligent enquiry upon
all the heads which were contained in the said writing. Many
abbats, priors and other persons of good character, accused the
said archbishop on all the above heads, in presence of the
clerk and people of the household of the said archbishop, who
excused him as far as they could, and said that before their
citation the said archbishop had made an appeal, and had set
out on his road to the Supreme Pontiff : alter hearing whom,
the said bishop of Lincoln and his colleagues, attentively hearing
the accusations of the adversaries of the archbishop of York,
and having committed the same to writing with all care, had
the same transmitted to the Supreme Pontiff, enclosed under
the testimony of their seals, assigning the archbishop a time
within three months, in obedience to the precept of the Supreme
Pontiff ; and of their own kindness they gave him an additional
term of six weeks, within which he was personally to appear
in the Apostolical presence : adding, that if he should not
do so, he was to know that he was from thenceforth suspended
from all pontifical duties by the Apostolic authority, as also
from the administration of the archbishopric. They also
assigned to the adversaries of the archbishop a time at the






352 ANNALS OF ROGER DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1195.

beginning of the calends of June, by which, having made all
sufficient preparations, they were to present themselves at the
Apostolic See, there to receive, the Lord so providing, what is
adjudged by the canons of the Church.

Accordingly, the aforesaid adversaries of the archbishop
appearing at Rome in the presence of our lord the pope, at
the time named, urgently made accusation against their
archbishop ; but the archbishop did not come at the time ap-
pointed, both by reason of the king's prohibition, and the
pestilence which at that time prevailed at Rome. His clerks,
however, appeared at the given time at the Roman court, and
alleging these as the causes of his absence, obtained that
whatever had in the meantime been done against the archbishop
since his appeal, should be repealed as null and void : and the
pope then appointed as the time for his coming to Rome, the
octave of Saint Martin next ensuing. But because not even
then did he make his appearance at the Roman court, either
himself or by a sufficient proxy, at the feast of the Nativity
of our Lord next ensuing, he was suspended from all episcopal
duties.

During the before-mentioned meeting of abbats, that took
place at York, to oppose the archbishop, Roger, abbat of Selby,
died, and was buried at Selby ; and, at the presentation of king
Richard, was succeeded by Richard, prior of the same house,
who received his benediction from Hubert Eitz- Walter, arch-
bishop of Canterbury, at this time, legate of all England.

In the same year, while the king of England was staying at
Chinon, in Anjou, certain assassins, fifteen in number, came
to the king's court. But when they attempted to approach the
king of England, for the purpose of killing him, some of them
were taken and made prisoners, on which they stated that the
king of Prance had sent them to assassinate the king of England;
but the king of England pretending not to know that these had
been the designs of the king of France, deferred pronouncing
judgment upon them, until such time as their associates should
have been arrested.

In the same year, in the month of February, Master Si-
mon of Apulia, dean of the church of York, returning from
the parts beyond sea, with the plenitude of the king's favour,
and his confirmation of his appointment to the deanery of the
church of York, on his approaching the city of York, there
went forth to meet him the clergy and people of the city in



A.D. 1195. HUGH, BISHOP OF DUKHAM, DIES. 353

great multitudes ; among whom were some of the household
of archbishop Geoffrey, namely, Master Otui and William de
Bonville, and two others, who forbade the said dean, on behalf
of our lord the pope and the archbishop of York, to approach
the mother church as dean thereof, until the dispute which
existed between the archbishop and himself, as to the said
deanery, should have been duly disposed of by the Roman
Pontiff, and appealed thereon to our lord the pope. And be-
cause the said dean would not desist from his purpose, they
laid violent hands on him ; but being immediately excommu-
nicated themselves, on account of this violence, they allowed
him to go ; on which he proceeded on his way and came to the
mother church, and the canons of the church received him in
solemn procession, this taking place on the Lord's day next
before the beginning of Lent : and, at the beginning of Lent,
Hugh, bishop of Durham, came to York, and confirmed the
sentence of excommunication pronounced upon those who had
laid violent hands upon the dean. While the said bishop of
Durham was on his road thence to London, and had arrived at
Doncaster, he fell ill, and being unable to proceed any further,
was carried by ship to his vill of Hoveden.

In the same month of February, in the country of the king
of Scotland, died Gregory, bishop of Ross, who was succeeded
by Reginald, surnamed " the Lean," a monk of Melrose. It is
stated, that in the cathedral church of the bishopric of Ross,
which is called Rosmarein, Saint Boniface, the pope who was
the fourth from Saint Gregory, was buried. About this Boni-
face we read in the Ecclesiastical histories, that he prevailed
upon Phocas Ca3sar, the emperor of the Romans, to present the
Temple at Rome, which was previously called the Pantheon,
to the church of God; and, after banishing therefrom the
abominations of Devils, he dedicated it in honor of the blessed
Mary, the Mother of God and ever a virgin, and of all the Saints,
appointing that festival to be celebrated every year, at the be-
ginning of the calends of November.

In the same year, in the month of March, on the third day
of that month, being the sixth day of the week, Hugh, bishop
of Durham, departed this life, at his vill of Hoveden, and was
buried at Durham, in the chapter house of the monks ; but
before his body had entered Durham, Walter de Ferlington
delivered to Hugh Bardolph the castle of Durham, and hung
up the keys of the castle over the shrine of Saint Cuthbert.

Rodolph de Stavely inconsiderately rushing on for the purpose
of seizing them, fear suddenly came upon him, and, going back,
he hung up the keys over the shrine where they previously
were ; but before leaving the church, by the judgment of God
he was scourged with a severe attack of illness, and died in a
few days after. The said keys, however, were afterwards
delivered by the hands of the prior and of the monks to Hugh
Bardolph, who made oath that he would faithfully keep them
to the honor of Saint Cuthbert and the king. After this, Hugh
de Ferlington delivered to Hugh Bardolph the castle of Nor-
ham, by command of the king's justiciary.

In the meantime, at the instance of the canons of York,
pope Celestinus wrote to the following effect to Eoger de Lei-
cester and Winemer de Northampton, archdeacons of the church
of Lincoln:

The Letter of pope Celestinw against Geoffrey, archbishop of
York.

" Celestinus, the bishop, servant of the servants of God, to
his dearly beloved sons, Haimo, dean of Lincoln, Roger de
Leicester, and Winemer de Northampton, archdeacons ap-
pointed in the diocese of Lincoln, health and the Apostolic
benediction. Our most dearly beloved sons, Simon, the dean,
and the chapter of the church of Saint Peter at York, have
informed us that, after appeal made to us, the clerks of the
chapel of our venerable brother, the archbishop of the said church,
and some other persons, have been intruded into the cathedral
church of the said city, to the great prejudice of the canons,
the vicars and clerks of the said church being excluded there-
from, for the purpose of ministering therein, and, contrary to
the ancient and approved custom, usurping the places and stalls
of the clergy in the choir and chapter, have presumed to contravene
the regulations of the church. "Wherefore, wishing, as is right
and proper, to put an end to presumptuous acts of this nature,
we do by our precept, by means of these our Apostolical writings
command, that, if what we have before stated is true, you will
compel these presumptuous persons, by force of ecclesiastical
censure, all power of appeal being taken away, in your pre-
sence to make due satisfaction for these matters to the church
of Saint Peter, and the canons thereof. You are also to cause
reparation to be made for the losses which shall appear to have
been inflicted by the same clerks upon the aforesaid chapter in



A.D. 1195. HUGH, BISHOP OF COVENTBY, IS PABDONED. 355

such manner as shall be just. And if you shall not be able
all of you to take part in the performance hereof, then two of
you are to carry out the same. Given at Saint Peter's, at
Borne, on the second day before the calends of June, in the
fourth year of our pontificate."

Accordingly, on the authority of these letters, the said dean
of Lincoln and his colleagues appointed for the parties a time
and place, first at Torkesey, and next at Avechester, where, in
their presence, they proved the losses of the priors and canons
of the church of York, which they had sustained by the arch-
bishop of York and his intruders, to be of the value of one
thousand marks of silver.

In the same year, Bichard, king of England, forgave his
brother, John, all the wrath and displeasure he felt towards
him, and restored to him the earldom of Mortaigne, the honor
of Eye, and the earldom of Gloucester, and all the appurte-
nances thereto belonging, with the exception of the castles :
and, instead of all his other earldoms and lands, the king gave
him eight thousand pounds of money Anjouin per annum.

In the same year, the Supper of our Lord approaching, on
John, bishop of Whitherne, the suffragan and deputy of Geof-
frey, archbishop of York, coming near to York, that he might
there, according to usual custom, consecrate the chrism and the
oil at the Supper of our Lord, the dean and clergy of the church
of York refused to receive him. Consequently, he went to
Sewell, and there consecrated the chrism and oil at the Supper
of our Lord, and delivered them to the officials of the arch-
bishop to distribute to the churches in the archbishopric. It is
even said that Geoffrey de Muschamp, archdeacon of Cleveland,
received the chrism and oil, and immediately threw them upon
a dunghill. However, the other canons of the church of Saint
Peter declined to receive any part thereof, but sent to Hugh,
bishop of Lincoln, to obtain the oil and chrism of him ; they
were deceived, however, in their expectations : for Peter, arch-
deacon of Lincoln, brother of archbishop Geoffrey, forbade the
bishop to give them the oil and chrism, and appealed on the
matter to the Roman Pontiff.

In the same year, the king forgave his wrath and displea-
sure against Hugh, bishop of Coventry, and restored to him the
bishopric, for five thousand marks of silver, which he paid to
him ; but Robert, the brother of the said bishop, died in the
custody of our lord the king, at Dover.

AA2



356 ANNALS OF ROGER DE HOVEDEN. A.D.1195.

In like manner, our lord the king forgave his brother Geof-
frey, archbishop of York, his wrath and displeasure, and re-
ceived him with the kiss of peace ; in consequence of which,
the said archbishop being beyond measure elated, so exaspe-
rated the king by his insolent speeches, that he ordered him to
be deprived of his archbishopric and the shrievalty of York.
Would that the archbishop had read the warning of the philo-
sopher, who says : " Stir not the fire with the sword." The
Lord, also, inculcating humility in us, says, by the mouth of
His Apostle, " Servants, be obedient to your masters in the
Lord." 28 I say not only to the wise and modest, but also
to the morose: "Be ye subject to the king as pre-eminent,
and to his ministers sent by him for the punishment of the
wicked and the praise of the good. Behold the ships ! large
though they be, and are threatened by mighty winds, by a
small helm are they turned round, wherever the intention 01
him who steers shall guide them : so, too, though the tongue
is a small member, it leads to great results. Behold ! the fire,
however small, how great the wood it can burn ! The tongue
is truly a fire, and from the tongue all iniquity is carried into
effect, which pollutes and inflames the whole body ; and no
one is able to control the tongue, but he who is wise and cir-
cumspect. Therefore, let us circumcise our hearts ; for, from
the uncircumcised heart proceed fornications, adulteries, mur-
ders, thefts, false- witness, blasphemies, contentions, and strifes,
and the like to these, which are the things that defile a man ; 29
and on the contrary to this, out of the clean and circumcised
heart proceed charity, cheerfulness, peace, patience, long-
suffering, kindness, benignity, meekness, fidelity, modesty,
continence, chastity, and other things like unto these, which
are the fruits of the soul, and lead it unto God its Creator, for
* out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh,' 30
whether it be good or whether bad."

In the same year, there came a hermit to king Richard,
and, preaching the words of eternal salvation to him, said :
" Be thou mindful of the destruction of Sodom, and abstain
from what is unlawful ; for if thou dost not, a vengeance worthy
of God shall overtake thee." The king, however, intent upon
the things of this world, and not those which are of God, was
not able so readily to withdraw his mind from what was un-

28 Eph. vi. 5, not quite correctly quoted.

lawful, unless the revelation should come to him from above,
or he should behold a sign. For he despised the person of his
adviser, not understanding that sometimes the Lord reveals to
babes the things that are hidden from the wise ; for the lepers
announced good tidings to Samaria, 31 and the ass of Balaam
recalled its master from the unlawful way. "Wherefore, the
/lierrnit/ leaving the king, went his way, and hid himself from
oeTore his face. In process of time, however, although the be-
fore-named king despised the admonition of the poor hermit,
still, by the inspiration of the Divine grace, he retained some
part of his warning in his memory, having faith in the Lord
that He who recalled the publicans and the Canaanitish woman
to repentance, in His great mercy would give to him a penitent
heart.

Hence it was, that on the Lord's day in Easter week, the Lord
visited him with a rod of iron, not that he might bruise him,
but that he might receive the scourging to his advantage. For
on that day, the Lord scourged him with a severe attack of
illness, so that, calling before him religions men T he was not
ashamed to confess the guiltiness of his life, and, after receiving
absolution, took back his wife, whom for a long time he had
not known : and, putting away all illicit intercourse, he re-
mained constant to his wife, and they two became one flesh,
and the Lord gave him health both of body and of soul. Oh !
happy the son, whom, in this pilgrimage," thlHather's severity
chastens for his correction, and not for his destruction ! For
the father corrects his son sometimes in kind words, and
sometimes in harsh, that, by the one means or the other, he
may recall him to do what is right. And thus, in the furnace
of justice does the Lord try His gold ; there does He in
adversity prove His holy one, that He may promote him to a
crown. Truly, great and inexpressible are the works of the
Lord, and His mercies are over all His works. For this king,
over whose head his iniquities had passed away, was adopted
by Christ as His son, and turning from his wickedness unto the
Lord, was received by Him as a son.

For God, in whose hands are the hearts of kings, and who
turneth them whichever way He thinketh fit, instilled it into
the heart of the king, that he should so quickly change his life
and conversation for the better : for, rising early every day, he
first sought the kingdom of God and its justice, and did not

depart from, the church until, after the usage of the Church,
the whole of the Divine service had been performed. A glo-
rious thing indeed is it for a prince to begin his daily actions,
and to finish them in Him who is the beginning without
beginning, and who judges the limits of the earth.

The said king, mindful also of those words which say,
" Blessed is he that considereth the poor and needy ; the Lord
will deliver him in time of trouble," 32 ojded_each_day, many
poor to be fed, both ip his nnnr^ ^g also in cities Main" his
viUs, whom he daijj^increased.^^ccQrdingL .as -ihejre was need.
For there was a great famine in this land, and the poor resorted
to him that they might be fed. By the example of such, is
faith confirmed, hope upraised, charity nourished, humility
protected, devotion increased, and a desire to do good excited.
The said king also caused many chalices of gold and silver to
be made, which he distributed among the churches, from which
their chalices had been taken for the purpose of paying his
ransom. "Woe unto that man through whom the offence
cometh;" 33 for it ought not to be imputed to the king that
through him those chalices had been given for his ransom, but
rather it ought to be laid to the charge of those who gave such
counsel to him, inasmuch, as "Evil communications corrupt
good manners," 34 and we read in the Gospel, 35 "Wherefore he
hath the greater sin who hath delivered me up unto thee."

In the same year, pope Celestinus, at the prayer of Richard,
king of England, appointed Hubert, archbishop of Canterbury,
legate of the whole of England ; on which occasion, the said
pope wrote to him to the following effect :

The Letter of pope Celestinus on the legateship of Hubert,
archbishop of Canterbury.

" Celestinus, the pope and bishop, servant of the servants of
God, to his venerable brother, Hubert, archbishop of Canter-
bury, legate of the Apostolic See, health and the Apostolic
benediction. That sincerity in its duteousness and in its
established faith, which the church of England has always
maintained towards the holy Church of Eome, has, as we fully
trust, flourished once again under your energy and prudence,
and has received an acceptable increase of tranquil fervour

refreshed, and are strengthened by the vigour of the constancy
which you manifest ; so much so, that we may now more openly by
our deeds disclose the confidence we have placed in your probity.
"Wherefore, at the entreaty of our most dearly beloved son in
Christ, Eichard, the illustrious king of the English, and all the
suffragans of the church of Canterbury, that the church of
England might have a legate from the Apostolic See, for its
own advantage, as also that of the kingdom ; as also, in con-
sideration of the feelings of devotion which we entertain towards
the church of Canterbury for the merits of its glorious martyr,
and out of respect for your virtues and honesty, we have given
our assent and favour to their prayers; and this in especial,
because we believe that it will greatly conduce to the advan-
tage of the Church and of the kingdom if she receives such a
person, acting in the above-named kingly office, as the urgent
prayers of the said king and of others pronounce you to be,
in commendation of the meritoriousness of your life, and of
your devotion to the faith. Therefore we do for the honor
of God, for the safety of the church of Canterbury, and
for the peace of the whole kingdom of England, all excep-
tions or privileges granted to our venerable brother, Geoffrey,
archbishop of York, or to his church, or any other, notwith-
standing, grant unto you the office of legate, enjoining you by
these Apostolic writings, to receive the same with the humility
of fraternal obedience, and, in accordance with the powers
granted you by heaven, for the purpose of amending the things
that require amendment, and of enacting what requires to be
enacted, to apply the hand of diligence to the exercise of
the authority of the legateship : so observing in all things,
with ready dutifulness, the respect, due to your mother, the
lloman Church, that, through the profitableness of the ministry,
which with joy she entrusts to you, you may, by your acts,
render her even more joyful. Given at the Lateran, on the
fifteenth day before the calends of April, in the fourth year of
our pontificate."

The said pope Celestinus wrote also to the following effect
to Geoffrey, archbishop of York, and all the bishops, abbats,
priors, and others, appointed prelates of churches throughout
the kingdom of England :

" Celestinus, the bishop, servant of the servants of God, to
his venerable brethren in Christ, the archbishop of York, and
all bishops, abbats, priors, and others, appointed prelates of

churches throughout the kingdom of England, health and the
Apostolic benediction. The inscrutable depths of the Divine
wisdom have established the Holy Church throughout the
breadth of this world, and have, in its inimitable foresight, so
willed its rule and governance to be carried out, that, for the
purpose of its healthful governance, many should be associated
in the care thereof, although, for the purpose of establishing
ecclesiastical unity, the Roman Church has received the fulness
of power therein. For it has willed that, in accordance with
what is said by the Prophet in reference to the Church, some
should be born unto the fathers, who, being appointed princes
over the earth, might by the merits of their virtues, and by the
words of doctrine, train those ignorant of the faith, when more
advanced, to righteousness. Wherefore, the holy Church of
Rome, to which Church the Lord has given rule over the others,
has, in her motherly care, had regard for the others from the
beginning, and has with a laudable practice, hitherto used all
watchfulness, that she might from different parts of the world
appoint prudent men to undertake the ministry of them, whose
authority and doctrine, under the control of the Roman Pon-
tiff, may minister to churches far distant those things which he
himself is not able. Accordingly, we, who, insufficient as our
merits may be, have been raised to the lofty elevation thereof,
following in the footsteps of our forefathers, so endeavour with
the help of God to perform the duties enjoined on us in
reference to the neighbouring churches, that a due and proper
foresight may not be withdrawn from those, from 'which, by
distance, we are far separated. Wherefore in especial, looking
with the eye of our fatherly regard at the present state of the
English Church, for its safety and for its especial advantage in
Christ, we have, by the common advice of our brethren, decreed
that our venerable brother, Hubert, archbishop of Canterbury,
in whose merits and virtue, wisdom and learning, the whole
church rejoices, taking upon himself the duties of the legate-
ship, shall, at will, perform our functions to the honor of
the Church, and the safety and peace of the entire realm,
throughout the whole kingdom of England, all exceptions or
privileges granted to you or to your church, or to any other
brother archbishop, notwithstanding. Therefore, by our au-
thority, we do command the whole of you, through these
Apostolic writings, to show to him all due reverence and
honor as legate of the Apostolic See, and humbly to receive

his healthful warnings and commands, and to obey the same,
steadfastly observing the things that, by the authority of the
legateship, which by the will of the Lord he holds, he shall
think fit and proper to ordain. Given at the Lateran, on the
fifteenth day before the calends of April, in the fourth year of
our pontificate."

Accordingly, upon the authority of these letters, the said
archbishop of Canterbury, legate of the Apostolic See, sent
to York Master Peter, the prior of Bineham, in Norfolk, and
Master Gervaise, with the letters of our lord the pope, and letters
from himself to the canons of York, and to the officers of the
archbishop of York, sending word to them, that he should
shortly come thither on the authority of his legateship, for the
purpose of amending the things that required to be amended,
and of enacting the things that, with the sanction of the Lord,
required to be enacted; and he commanded them, convoking
the clergy, to show to him, as the legate of the Apostolic See, due
honor and obedience, adding, that he had already pronounced
sentence of excommunication upon all those who in this respect
should contravene the mandates of our lord the pope. He also
sent, relative thereto, his letters patent to Simon, the dean of
York, instructing him, if he should find any rebellious against
the said mandate of our lord the pope, to denounce them as ex-
communicated. Accordingly, both the canons, as also the officers
of the archbishop of York, answered the messengers of the le-
gate, that they would receive him in his character of legate of
the Apostolic See, but not as archbishop of Canterbury, or pri-
mate.

The legate arrived at York, on the feast of Saint Barnabas
the Apostle, being the Lord's day, and was received by the
clergy in solemn procession ; and, being escorted to the church
of the Cathedral See, on the Monday following caused assizes
to be held by his servants, of all pleas of the crown of the
king, and of novel disseisin and of mort d' ancestor ; while he
himself and his officers held pleas of spiritual matters. On the
following day, being the third day of the week, the legate pro-
ceeded to the abbey of Saint Mary of York, and was there re-
ceived in solemn procession by the monks of the said church. He
then entered the chapter-house of the monks, and on the monks
making complaint to him that Robert their abbat could not, by
reason of sickness, and his bad state of health, discharge his
duties to the house, he removed him from his pastoral charge,

and from the government of the house, protesting against the
same, and appealing thereon to the Supreme Pontiff.

On the two following days, namely, the fourth and fifth days
of the week, there being assembled in the church of Saint Peter
at York, Simon, the dean of that church, Hamo, the praecentor,
William Testard, and Geoffrey de Muschamp, the archdeacons
of Nottingham and Cleveland, John the chancellor, and Robert,
the prior of Beverley, together with some of the canons of the
said church, and nearly all the abbats, priors, officers, deans,
and parsons of the churches of the diocese of York, the legate
sat installed in an elevated place, and held a full synod ; in
which he enacted that the following statutes should be ob-
served.

The Decrees of the Synod of York.

" Whereas, among the other Sacraments of the Church, the
host of salvation is pre-eminent in importance, therefore
ought the devoutness of the priesthood to pay the more earnest
attention thereto, that the same may be made with humility, be
received with fear, and be dispensed with reverence ; and the
minister at the altar ought to be certain that the bread and
wine, and water, are placed ready for the sacrifice, nor should
it be celebrated without a literate minister officiating thereat.
Care is also to be taken, that the host is kept in a clean and
fair pyx, and is received on each Lord's day."

" As often as a communion is to be celebrated for the sick,
the priest in his own person, in a clerical dress befitting a Sa-
crament so important, is to carry the host, a light going before
him, unless the inclemency of the weather, or the difficulty of the
way, or some other reason shall prevent it ; because the mys-
tery of the mass is frequently found to be corrupted, either by
errors in the writing, or through the age of the books, so as
not to be able to be distinctly read.

" The attention of the archdeacon is also to provide that in
each church the canon of the mass is compared with all dili-
gence, with a true and approved copy thereof.

"We do also forbid any priest through cupidity to enjoin any
layman when he comes to receive absolution, to have masses
performed ; and we have thought proper to forbid that any
priest shall make a bargain for the celebration of mass at a
stated price, but he is to receive that alone which is offered at
the mass.



A.D. 1195. DECBEES OF THE SYNOD OF TOIIK. 363

" We do also enact, that in baptism not more than three spon-
sors shall receive a child from the holy font, two males and
one female a male child, and two females and one male a female
child.

"Also, where a child, the fact of whose previous baptism is
unknown, is found exposed, whether with salt or whether with-
out salt, 36 it is to be baptized, since ' that is not known to be re-
peated which is not known to have been already done.'

" We do also decree, that, unless under the pressure of great
and urgent necessity, no deacon shall baptize, or shall dispense
the body of Christ to any person, or shall impose penance on
one making confession ; as, according to the tenor of the canons
of our forefathers, antiquity determines to have these things of
right to belong to the order of the priesthood.

" According to the tenor of the same institutions, we do also
enact, that as often as a priest is called upon to baptize a child,
or to communicate with a sick person, he shall not presume to
be guilty of delay.

" Whereas, in the house of prayer, which is called * The house
of God,' there ought to be nothing unbecoming, nothing left
unprepared, we do order that the parsons and vicars of churches
shall make it their object to provide, in proportion to their
incomes received, according as reason demands, and approved
custom requires, in order that those churches which stand in
need of repair may be repaired.

" Also, Divine service is to be performed with the furniture
suitable to that service.

"Also, the sacrament of the Eucharist is to be celebrated with
a silver chalice, where there are means for so doing ; and as the
time for carrying out this ordinance, we do appoint one year
from the beginning of our legateship ; and if, in the meantime,
this ordinance shall not have been carried into execution, we
do decree that before the expiration of that time our order shall,
out of the revenue of the churches, be carried into effect.

"We do also enact, that clerks who have received the tonsure
from the bishops, shall retain that tonsure and shorn head ;
and if they shall neglect to retain the same, then they are to be

38 By the decrees of the church, salt was ordered to be placed about
the persons of children exposed, signifying that they had not been bap-
tized. Judging from the present enactment, it seems to have been con-
sidered that no confidence could be put in the observance of this order ;
and, indeed, it was not likely that those who exposed their children, would
be very particular about their welfare in another existence.



364 ANNALS OF ROGER DE HOVEDEN. A. D. 1195.

compelled so to do by deprivation of their benefices, if they
have any ; and as for those who have not any benefices, let
them, whether they will or no, be shorn by the archdeacon or
by the deans.

" We do also command that priests shall not go in hoods with
long sleeves, but rather in vestments suited to their order ; that
in the same degree in which they excel others in dignity of
station, they may more fully set the pattern and example of
propriety.

" Inasmuch as the Scripture testifies that he is blessed 'who
shaketh his hands from holding of bribes,' 37 attention must be
paid with earnest zeal that justice is done without reward, and
no one is to presume to receive any reward whatever for doing
the same in causes ecclesiastical, or for withholding it, or for
accelerating it, or for deferring it, that so at the fitting time
the just Judge may give him the reward of justice.

" Inasmuch as tithes are the tribute of souls that stand in need,
and are bound to be given in obedience to the command of
God, it is not for him that pays them to diminish the same.
We do therefore enact, that of those which are yearly renewed,
the due and customary tithes shall be paid entirely and in full ;
so that in the first place tithes are to be given without any dimi-
nution to the Church, and after that, out of the remaining nine
parts, the wages of the reapers and of the other servants are to
be paid at discretion.

"The profession of religious sanctity demands that monks and
canons regular and nuns should be kept religiously and in obedi-
ence to rules. To the end, therefore, that all opportunity of going
astray may be taken away from them, we do forbid that they
shall hold those revenues to farm which go under the name of
obediences, 38 or shall go upon distant pilgrimages, or beyond the
monasteries, without a certain and reasonable cause, and they
are not to go without the society of other persons whose cha-
racter is assured and beyond all doubt. Also, as to nuns, we
do especially add, that they are not, without the society of
the abbess or prioress, to go beyond the precincts of the mo-
nastery.

"We do also, in addition, forbid any layman to take any church

*7 Isaiah xxxiii. 15.

38 " Obedientiae" was the name given to cells, farms, and granges that
paid certain rentals to abbeys, and were often presided over by monks
delegated for that purpose from the abbey.



A.D. 1195. DECREES OF THE SYNOD OF TOEK. 365

or tithes to farm, whether solely, or whether in partnership
with a clerk.

" That the dishonesty of calumniators, and the wickedness of
rash swearers may be checked, through fear of the Divine judg-
ment, we do order that, for the future, every priest, three times
in the year, with candles lighted and bells ringing, shall
solemnly excommunicate those who, in recognizances and other
matters of testimony, shall have knowingly and wilfully been
guilty of perjury, and those who shall wickedly cause others
to be guilty of perjury, and shall on every Lord's day denounce
them as excommunicated ; to the end that the frequent repetition
of the malediction may withdraw those from their iniquity,
whom the accusation of their own conscience does not deter
therefrom. But if they repent of their perjury, let them be
sent before the archbishop or bishop, or, in the absence of the
archbishop or bishop, general confessor of the diocese, for the
purpose of receiving absolution from him. But in cases where
persons are in the last extremity, penance is to be suggested,
and not to be enforced ; and they are to be strictly enjoined, if
they shall survive, to go before the archbishop or bishop, or, in
the absence of the archbishop or bishop, the general confessor
of the diocese, to the end that due penance may be imposed
on them.

" Because it is the word of the Lord, l If any priest shall sin,
he will make my people to sin,' 39 and ' A wicked priest is the
ruin of the people,' the excellence of so high an order requires
that priests should abstain from public drinkings, and from
taverns, and that those who are bound by a vow of chastity,
should by no means give way to acts of uncleanness. We do,
therefore, forbid them to have harlots in their houses, or, when
expelled therefrom, in fraud of our enactments, to have access
to them in the houses of others. But if they shall persist in
their uncleanness, and the superiors, concealing it, shall not
bring the same to the notice of their prelates, they shall be sus-
pended from their duties ; but those who, inflamed by zeal
for God, have told the prelates of their excesses, shall obtain
the favour of the Divine blessing.

" Also, the punishment of those who publicly keep harlots,

shall be as follows : as being infamous, they shall be disabled

from making accusation against others, and from bearing

39 These words do not appear in Scripture ; though, of course, the

meaning of them is to be found there.



366 ANNALS OF EOGEE DE HOVEDEff. A.D. 1195.

witness : but if, not even through a fear of this punishment
they shall come to a sense of their duty, then let them know
that they shall be suspended from their offices and benefices.

" A person who is suspected of a crime by common report, or
by probable tokens, is to be admonished in a friendly manner
by the superior of the place, a first, second, and third time,
to amend his life ; and if he shall not do so, then the superior,
taking with him two or three others, to whom the common
report in his disfavour is known, shall rebuke him for the same ;
and if even then he shall not seem to be changed for the better,
let it be told unto the Church, that is to say, let him be accused
in the chapter, in order that, being convicted, or having con-
fessed, he may be canonically punished. But if he cannot be
convicted, then let him be called upon to make canonical purga-
tion of himself ; so however, that the number of his witnesses
may not exceed twelve, within which number, more or less may
be received according to the condition of the person, and the na-
ture and extent of the infamy, according to the opinion of those
giving judgment. And forthwith, on the first day on which he,
who is under the stigma of infamy, shall be in a condition to
exculpate himself, let the purgation take place, that, through
fear of vexation arising from delay, money may not be ex-
torted. This and the above enactments we have made, saving
in all things the authority and dignity of the Holy See."

At this synod, also, Master Peter De Dinant demanded full
restitution to be made to him of the archdeaconry of the West
Biding, which Geoffrey, archbishop of York, had given him,
instructing the chapter of York, by his letters, to receive and
instal him; on which Simon, the dean, and the chapter of
York, made answer, that the archbishop could not give that
archdeaconry to any one, because he had delayed to present to
it beyond the time appointed by the statute of the council of
the Lateran, in which council pope Alexander the Third enacted
that when it shall happen that prebends, livings, or any offices
shall be vacant in any church, they shall not remain too long in
a state of suspense, but shall, within six months, be conferred
on persons who shall be able worthily to discharge the duties of
the same. And if the bishop, when the presentation shall be-
long to him, shall delay to present, then be it performed by the
chapter ; and if the election belongs to the chapter, and, within
the time prescribed, it shall not so do, then let the bishop, with
the aid of the Lord, and with the counsel of religious men,

perform that duty : or in case all shall happen to neglect so
to do, let the metropolitan of the bishops, with the aid of the
Lord, dispose thereof, without any gainsaying on their part.

Accordingly, on the authority of this enactment, and under the
protection of the privilege granted to the church of York by the
indulgence of pope Celestinus the Third, the said dean and chapter
of York asserted that to them belonged the presentation of the
aforesaid archdeaconry, and of the other benefices vacant in the
church of York, to which their archbishop had not presented
within the time fixed by the council of Lateran. But the
deputies of the archbishop of York, namely, Master Gerard de
Rowelle, and Master Honorius, made appeal against this pri-
vilege, and renewed the appeal which their lord the arch-
bishop had made on his departure, in regard to the state of
his church, before the legate and the whole synod ; and al-
though in that privilege it was stated to be one without appeal,
the legate still deferred to the appeal of the deputies of the
archbishop of York.

In the same year, William, king of the Scots, fell ill at a
vill of his, the name of which is Clackmannan, and named
Otho, son of Henry, duke of Saxony, and nephew of Richard,
king of England, his heir to the kingdom of the Scots, upon
condition that the said Otho should marry his eldest daughter,
and take her with the kingdom. Although the king had a
great many who consented to his wishes herein, still earl Patrick
and many others opposed them, saying, that they would not
receive the daughter as queen, because it was not the custom
in that realm that a woman should possess the kingdom,
so long as there was a nephew, or brother, of her race, who
might, according to law, possess the kingdom. However, shortly
after, by the mercy of God, the king of the Scots recovered from
his illness, abiding in the same determination that he had
made, as to giving his daughter in marriage to the said Otho,
together with his kingdom.

In the same year, Hubert, archbishop of Canterbury, legate
of the Apostolic See, and justiciary of the whole of England,
deposed Robert, abbat of Tournay, he protesting against the same,
and appealing to the presence of our lord the pope; and
he kept him in prison and in irons for a year and a half, at
Gloucester. In the same year, the said archbishop, as jus-
ticiary of the whole of England, sent throughout England a
form of oath to be taken as follows :



368 ANNALS OF EOGER DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1195.

" That all subjects of the kingdom of England, shall, to the
best of their power, keep the peace of their lord the king ;
that they shall not be thieves or robbers, nor yet harbourers
of them, nor shall in any way abet them ; and that whenever
they shall be able to know of any malefactors of that cha-
racter, they shall, to the best of their ability, endeavour to take
them, and deliver them up to the sheriffs, and they shall
on no account be liberated but by our lord the king, or his
chief justice ; and if they shall not be able to arrest them, they
shall give notice of them, whoever they may be, to the bailiffs
of our lord the king. When a hue and cry' is raised for the
pursuit of outlaws, robbers, thieves, or the harbourers of
such, all shall join in pursuit of them to the best of their abi-
lity ; and if they shall see any one, and it shall be clear that
he has not joined in the said pursuit, or that he has, without
permission, withdrawn himself therefrom, they shall take such
same persons, as though they were the offenders, and deliver
them to the sheriffs, not to be set at liberty, but by the king,
or by his chief justice.

" Also, the knights who are appointed for that purpose, shall
make all persons of their respective districts, of the age of fif-
teen years and up wards, appear before them, and shall make them
swear that they will keep the peace of our lord the king, in
manner above-mentioned, and that they will not be outlaws,
robbers, or thieves, nor yet harbourers of them, nor will in
any way abet them ; and that they will, in manner above
stated, make full pursuit of them, and, if they shall take any
one in the commission of an offence, will deliver them to
the knights placed over them in their respective districts and
for that purpose appointed, who shall deliver him into the
custody of the sheriff ; and in like manner, on a hue and cry
being raised for the purpose of pursuing the said offenders, if
they shall see any person, or it shall be known to them that
any person does not join in the pursuit, or if he shall, without
leave, withdraw himself from the pursuit, they shall take
him as the offender, and deliver him to the aforesaid knights,
for the purpose of being delivered into the custody of the
sheriff, as though he were the offender himself ; and he shall
not be liberated, except by the command of our lord the king,
or his chief justice."

Accordingly, for the purpose of carrying out these orders,
select and trustworthy men were sent throughout all the






A D.I 105. CONFERENCE OF THE KINGS OF FRANCE AND ENGLAND. 369

counties of England, who, upon the oaths of trusty men, ar-
rested many in their respective neighbourhoods, and put them
in the king's prisons. Many, however, being forewarned
thereof, and having bad consciences, left their homes and pos-
sessions, and took to flight.

In the same year, after the Nativity of Saint John the Bap-
tist, Henry, emperor of the Romans, sent to Eichard, king of
England, a massive crown of gold, of great value, as a token
of their mutual affection ; requesting him, by the fealty which
he owed him, and as he took an interest in his hostages, that
they might not come to harm, to make a hostile invasion of the
territories of the king of France, on which the emperor him-
self would give him ample succours for the purpose of avenging
the injuries done him by the king of France. However, the
king of England, fearing that in this message there might be
some treachery lying concealed, sent to the emperor, William,
bishop of Ely, his chancellor, for the purpose of enquiring
what kind of succours, and when and where the emperor would
give him aid against the king of France. For it was well
known to the king of England that the said emperor, above all
things, desired that the kingdom of France might become sub-
ject to the Roman empire ; while, on the other hand, the king of
England conjectured that if an alliance were formed between
the emperor and the king of France, the whole would redound
to his own detriment.

Accordingly, the king of France, being aware that the chan-
cellor of the king of England would pass through his territory,
attempted to take him ; but being deceived in his expectations,
sent word to the king of England that there was an end to the
truce ; immediately on which, the armies of both, engaging, did
the greatest damage on both sides in the destruction of men,
and in ravages and conflagrations. The king of France, how-
ever, seeing that he could in nowise defend himself against the
king of England, destroyed many castles in Normandy, which
the king of England soon after rebuilt, and rendered still
stronger than they had been before.

However, one day, before the destruction of the castle of
Val Rodol, the said kings came to hold a conference near that
castle ; but while they were holding it, a great part of the
walls of the castle fell, through the operations of the miners
of the king of France ; seeing which, the king of England left
the conference, and made an attack upon the army of the king

of Prance ; on which the king of France and his men took to
flight, and while he was crossing a bridge, the bridge fell
down, and he himself with his people was almost drowned in
the river Seine. However, at last, with great difficulty reach-
ing the opposite side, he pitched his camp there on the banks
of the river ; on which, the king of England returned to the
castle of Rodol, and' took many of the household of the king of
Prance, and then levying a large army from all his territories on
both sides of the sea, entered the territories of the king of
Prance ,in many places, and made a great slaughter of those
who resisted, reaped the standing corn though not yet ripe,
rooted up the vines and fruit-bearing trees, and burned the
towns.

In the same year, on the occasion of the dissensions that
existed between Philip, king of Prance, and Richard, king of
England, Boyac El Emir Amimoli, emperor of Africa, with a
large army, entered the territories of the Christians of Spain,
and defeated them, and took their cities, castles, and fortresses,
and destroyed them ; he also defeated Alphonso, king of Castille,
in a pitched battle, and after he had driven him from the field,
besieged him in his city of Toledo ; but being able to effect
nothing there, withdrew with his army.

When the king of Prance and the king of England came to
hear of this, they met to hold a conference upon making peace
between themselves, and came to an agreement to the fol-
lowing effect : Louis, son and heir to the king of France,
was to marry the sister of Arthur, duke of Brittany, the niece
of the said king of England ; and the said king of England was
to quitclaim to them and to their heirs Gisors, and Nefle, and
Baudemont, with the Norman Vexin, Vernon, Ivery, and
Pascy, and was also to give them twenty thousand marks of
silver, while, on the other hand, the king of France was to quit-
claim to the king of England all that he demanded of him in
the county of Angouleme, and was to restore to him the county
of Aumarle, the county of Auch, the castle of Arches, and
many other castles which he had taken from him in Normandy
and other of his territories in the war.

All these arrangements, however, were delayed until the
octave of All Saints, in consequence of the prohibition of the
emperor of the Romans, who forbade the king of England to
make peace with the king of Prance, unless with his advice
and consent. Moreover, at the same conference, the king of



A. I). 1195. 31ETT7B3J OF THE ENVOYS OF THE KING OF ENGLAND. 371

England restored to the king of France his sister Alice, whom
he shortly after gave in marriage to John, count de Pontif.

In the meantime, the pagans, laying waste the territories
of Sancho, king of Portugal, came to the abbey of Alcobaca,
and slew the monks of the Cistercian order, who were there
serving God, and those who offered resistance to them. Next
going thence, they came to another house of the same order ;
on which the monks, coming forth to meet them, fell at the
feet of the pagans, asking for life and mercy ; and the pagans,
taking compassion on them, granted them their lives ; and, hear-
ing of their life and conversation, praised them, saying that
they would wish to be saved with that order, if they only had
women ; for it must be known that the especial religion of the
pagans is sensuality.

In the same year, Hugh, bishop of Lincoln, gave to Eichard,
king of England, one thousand marks of silver, for the pur-
chase of the freedom of the church of Lincoln ; for the king,
according to the custom of his English predecessors, demanded
yearly of the bishop of Lincoln, one mantle furred with sable,
and, for the release of all claims for ever on the part of the said
king and his heirs of the said mantle, the said bishop of Lin-
coln gave to the before-named king the said sum of money, and
received from the king his charter quitclaiming the same.

In the meantime, William, bishop of Ely, and the other envoys
of the king of England who had been sent to the emperor, re-
turned, stating that that form of peace which had been agreed
to between him and the king of Prance did not please the
emperor, because it seemed disgraceful to the emperor that the
king of England should quitclaim anything that was not in his
power ; and for the purpose of recovering what the king of
England had lost in consequence of his captivity, the emperor
forgave him the sum of seventeen thousand marks of silver for
his ransom. Accordingly, the time for the conference approach-
ing, which the king of England and the king of France had
agreed on, to be held between them near Verneuil on the octave
of All Saints, the king of England made haste, the hour for the
conference being at hand, to have this interview with the king
of France : however, William, archbishop of Eheims, came to
meet him, and told him, on behalf of the king of France, that
there was no necessity for him to be in such haste, because
the king of France was still in consultation with his people.
Accordingly, the king of England believed him, and returned

373 ANNALS OF ROGER DE HOYEPEX. A.D. 1195.

to the place from which he had set out ; and, having waited
until the ninth hour, he declined to wait there any longer, but
approached, in order that he might hold the conference with
the king of France. On this, Philip, bishop of Beauvais, said
to him, in presence of the king of France, "My master the
king of France charges you with breach of faith and perjury ;
because you swore and gave your word that you would come
to-day at the third hour, and did not come, therefore he de-
nes you ;" accordingly, the conference was broken up, and
each king returned into his own territory.

The third day after this, the people of the king of France
made fierce ravages in Normandy, and in the other territories of
the king of England, attended with great tumult ; and coming to
the town of Dieppe, which the king of England had built
shortly before, they burned it, and the ships in the harbour, to
ashes by discharging Greek fire against it. After this, Philip,
king of France, after many and various casualties of war, came
with his army to Issodon, and took the castle. On this being
told to the king of England, who at this time was staying in
Normandy, at Yal Rodol, laying aside all other matters, he made
three days' march into one, and came to Issodon, and entered
his castle which the king of France had been besieging ; upon
which a numerous multitude of troops nocked to him from
every side.

The king of France, being greatly terrified at his arrival,
asked permission to depart thence with his army without mo-
lestation, which being refused him, he requested to have an
interview with the king of England, and the same accordingly
took place. At this interview, through the mediation of the
archbishops, bishops, and many of the men of either party, an
oath was taken by both sides, to the effect that, from that day,
that is to say, from the Saturday next after the feast of Saint
Nicholas, they would agree to peace and reconciliation between
themselves, and their subjects, and territories, until the feast
of Saint Hilary next ensuing ; at which time, they would meet
at Louviers, for the purpose, in a larger assemblage of their
subjects, of making peace and a final reconciliation between
them. And as the Nativity of our Lord was close at hand, and
the said kings had not in those parts means enough to suffice
for the expenses of royalty, during such a high festival, they re-
turned into their respective territories. The king of England
proceeded thence to Poitou, where he was at the feast of the



A.D. 1135. THE KING OF DEXMAEK COMPLAINS TO THE POPE. 373

Nativity of our Lord, which fell on the second day of the
week.

In the meantime, Alphonso, king of Castille, levying an
army, and having faith alone in the mercy and goodness of
God, fought a battle with the army of the Pagans, and defeated
them, and slew the greater part of them with the sword, and
drove the rest from his territories.

In the same year, the canons of the church of York often
and repeatedly pressed Hugh, bishop of Lincoln, to pronounce
sentence of interdict and suspension upon Geoffrey, archbishop
of York. For it was known that the said archbishop had not
made his appearance in the presence of our lord the pope, at
the time appointed for him so to do. The bishop of Lincoln,
however, made answer to them that he would rather be sus-
pended himself than suspend the archbishop ; on hearing
which, the before-named canons sent messengers to Rome, to
pope Celestinus, complaining that the bishop of Lincoln, and
his other judges delegate, had not proceeded according to the
tenor of the Apostolic mandate.

In the same year, Henry, bishop of Worcester, departed this
life, and was succeeded in the bishopric by John de Coutances,
dean of the church of Eouen. In this year, also, died William
de Fortz, earl of Aumarle, and was succeeded in the earldom
by Baldwin de Bethune, at the presentation of Richard, king
of England ; who also married the countess of Aumarle. In
this year, also, died Isaac, the former emperor of the island of
Cyprus, whom Richard, king of England, had taken.

In the same year, also, died Guido, the former king of Jeru-
salem, to whom Richard, king of England, had sold the island
of Cyprus ; after whose decease, his brother Aymer became
ruler of Cyprus.

In the same year, Philip, king of France, took to wife the
daughter of the duke of Genest, in Germany ; on which, Ca-
nute, king of the Danes, brother of the before-mentioned Botilda,
queen of the Franks, made complaint to pope Celestinus, of the
injury which the said king of France had done to his sister, in
having divorced her without a cause being known for his so
doing. He also made complaint against William, archbishop
of Rheims, who, without the Apostolic authority, sitting in
judgment, had effected the divorce between the said king of
France and Botilda his wife, without enquiry into the cause.
He also made complaint against Stephen de Noyon, Philip,



3*74 AXtfALS OF EOGEB DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1196.

bishop of Beauvais, Reginald, bishop of Chartres, Guido, bishop
of Orleans, and Hotrod, bishop of Chalons ; and against Robert,
count de Drues, Louis, count de Blois, Theobald, count de
Champagne, and Stephen, count de Nevers ; also, against the
barons, Simon de Castelane de 1'Isle, Peter de Mainil, and
Walter, chamberlain of the king of France, who had made oath
before the archbishop of Rheims, that the said Botilda, and the
daughter of the earl of Hainault, who had been the wife of the
said king of France, were so closely related in consanguinity,
that the said king of France ought on no account to, nor indeed
could, take the said Botilda to wife. But, although the said
king of the Danes was ready to prove that they had borne false
testimony against her, and that the said divorce was null and
void, and ought not to hold good, still, on account of his good
understanding with the king of France, pope Celestinus de-
clined 40 to listen to him relative thereto.

In the year of grace 1196, being the seventh year of the
reign of Richard, king of England, the said king was at Poitou,
on the day of the Nativity of our Lord, which fell on the se-
cond day of the week ; and on the same day, Hubert, arch-
bishop of Canterbury, justiciary of all England, and legate of
the Apostolic See, was at York, being sent, on the king's be-
half, to hold a conference with William, king of the Scots, on
the subject of contracting a marriage between Otho, son of
Henry, duke of Saxony, and nephew of Richard, king of Eng-
land, and his daughter Margaret. For there had been an agree-
ment made between Richard, king of England, and William,
king of Scotland, that the said king of Scotland should give to
the before-named Otho his daughter Margaret in marriage,
with the whole of Lothian ; and that the king of England
should give to Otho, and the daughter of the king of Scotland,
and their heirs, the whole of Northumberland, and the county
of Carlisle ; and that the king of England should have in his
charge the whole of Lothian, with its castles ; and the king of
Scotland should have in his charge the whole of Northumber-
land, and the county of Carlisle, with its castles. But, because
the queen of Scots was at that time in a state of pregnancy,
the king of Scotland was unwilling to abide by the said agree-
ment, hoping that the Lord would give him a son.

40 Roger of Wendover, however, says that the pope pronounced the
divorce to be null and void, and gives a copy of this Apostolic letter to
that effect.



A.D. 1196. LETTER OF POPE CELESTINTJS. 375

In the same year, on the fifth day of the Nativity of our
Lord, Bertram, prior of the church of Durham, met Hubert,
archbishop of Canterbury, at Alverton ; and there, in his pre-
sence, elected Master Philip, a clerk, and one of the household
of the king of England, bishop of Durham.

In the same year, pope Celestinus, at the urgent request of
the envoys of the dean and canons of York, wrote to the fol-
lowing effect to Simon, dean of the church of York.

The Letter of pope Celestinus to Simon, dean of York, on the
administration of that diocese.

" Celestinus, the bishop, servant of the servants of God, to
his dearly beloved son, Simon, dean of York, health and the
Apostolic benediction. Whereas, insufficient as we are, the
government of the universal Church has been, by the favour
of the Divine grace, entrusted to ourselves, and we are bound
in everything to take due precautions against casualties, and
to provide for the interests of the same, so are we bound with the
greatest care to use all precaution that churches may not incur
any injury in things temporal or spiritual, in those matters on
which it is our object to consult their honor and convenience.
And whereas, on considering the merits of persons, and dili-
gently examining into the same, a person may, according to
the merits of his actions, be found deserving to be suspended
by us from the exercise of his dignity, and to be removed for a
time from the prelacy of churches, to the end that matter may
not be furnished to private persons, placed under his pastoral
care, for speaking ill of him, and that all occasions for litiga-
tion may be removed ; we are still bound in such case to pro-
vide them with a person who shall know how to decide the
disputes of those engaged in litigation, and to correct the ex-
cesses of those subject to him, and, so far as the duties of his
office will allow, to love and cherish them with all affection.
Wherefore, inasmuch as, his deeds so requiring and his con-
tumacy demanding it, for abusing our patience, and not ceasing
from his iniquities, nor yet presenting himself before us within
the term, mercifully, by our indulgence, granted him, the arch-
bishop of York has been, by our authority, suspended both
from the use of the pall, from the discharge of Episcopal duties,
and from all ministration, in things spiritual as well as
temporal, and from the receipt of all profits thereof ; we have
thought proper, on the authority of these presents, to show



376 ANNALS OF ROGEB DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1196.

our indulgence to your discreetness, that thereby, with the
sanction of the canons residing in the church of York, you may
be enabled to correct the excesses of the clergy of the diocese
of York, and canonically to settle the disputes of clergy, as well
as laity, in the diocese of York, engaged in litigation, which
require to be terminated by ecclesiastical judgment ; that so,
all power of appeal taken away, you may be able to smite him
with canonical rigour who shall think fit herein contumaciously
to oppose you, until such time as, in our solicitude, it shall
have been otherwise provided for the Church. Therefore, be it
lawful for no man to infringe upon this page of our conclusion
so made, or, with rash presumption, to contravene the same :
but if any person shall dare attempt so to do, let him know
that he will incur the indignation of Almighty God, and of
Saint Peter and Saint Paul, the Apostles. Given at the Lateran,
on the tenth day before the calends of January, in the fifth
year of our pontificate."

Another Letter of pope Celestinus relative to the same matter.

" Celestinus, the bishop, servant of the servants of God, to
his dearly beloved sons, all the abbats, priors, archdeacons,
deans, and other clergy, and to the earls, barons, and other
persons in the province of York appointed, health, and the
Apostolic benediction. How mercifully the Eoman Church has
dealt with the deeds of the archbishop of York, is easily to be
seen, if you, with due care, consider the tenor of our letters
which both parties have at different times obtained from the
Apostolic See. For when, our dearly beloved sons, the dean and
chapter of York, and not a few of the abbats, priors, and other
prelates of the church in the kingdom of England established, in-
forming us thereon, it had come to the hearing of our Apostolate
that the said archbishop, neglecting the duties of his Apostolic
office, was involved in secular affairs, and not in his sacred duties,
not in ordaining the clergy, not in dedicating churches, not in
holding synods, not in pronouncing benedictions on abbats, but,
on the contrary, was giving the whole of his attention to hunting
and hawking, and was engaged in other things which were dero-
gatory in no slight degree to the pontifical office entrusted to
him and to his honor, we did not immediately form a judgment
against him, but thought proper to entrust the enquiry into
these reports to our venerable brother the bishop of Lincoln,
and our dearly beloved sons the archdeacon of Northampton and
the prior of Pontefract, calling upon the said archbishop, under



A.D. 1196. LETTER OF POPE CE.LESTINUS. 377

penalty of suspension, if those things which had been signified
unto us should be established, or, if the same should not be
lawfully proved, then through canonical purgation, which we
had caused to be prescribed to him with three bishops and as
many abbats, to withhold him from such excesses, and thereby to
recall him to the path of truth. But, inasmuch as the said
archbishop, before the citation of the said judges had reached
him, had made appeal to the Apostolic See, the said judges, in
accordance with the tenor of our letters, indulging him with a
space of three months, were careful to assign the same to him
as the period within which he was not to delay the prosecu-
tion of his said appeal. And further, after the said archbishop
had commenced his journey for the purpose of coming to the
Apostolic See, fearing lest, through the inclemency of the wea-
ther, some danger might befall his person, when by letters and
messengers he begged us mercifully to extend the time that had
been granted to him, we, assenting to his requests, and ima-
gining that on that account he would more speedily repent of
his excesses, as he had found us so propitious and ready to listen
to his prayers, appointed until the octave of Saint Martin last past
as the time for presenting his appeal for the purpose of exculpat-
ing himself ; giving it as our command, nevertheless, to the
aforesaid judges, that, if by such time the archbishop should
have neglected to present himself before us, in such case they
were from that time to proceed in his cause according to the
tenor of our letters, and make it their object to carry out the
instructions given them therein. And whereas the said time
has now expired, and he has neither come to the Church of
Kome nor sent any proxy in any way to make excuse for his
absence, and, in consequence thereof, considering his disobe-
dience and contumacy, we have thought proper to suspend him
from the use of the pall, and from the performance of his pon-
tifical duties, and from all ministration in things temporal
as well as spiritual, and from the receipt of profits, giving
orders by our Apostolic writings to the aforesaid judges, pub-
licly to announce throughout the whole diocese and province
of York, that he has been suspended by us. Wherefore, we
do command the whole of you, by these Apostolic writings, that
you will not henceforth presume to make answer to the said
archbishop or to his officers, either in matters spiritual or tem-
poral. But if it shall happen that any questions shall arise
between any of you in the diocese of York, which ought to be
settled by ecclesiastical judgment, you are to take the same



378 ANNALS OF KOGER DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1196.

questions for the hearing of our dearly beloved son, Simon,
dean of York, and to receive his judgment thereon with humi-
lity and firmness ; knowing that we, in accordance with the
customary mercy of the Apostolic See, have shewn indulgence
in appointing the said dean, that, with the advice of the canons
residing in the church of York, he may correct the excesses of
the clergy, and may settle such questions of them and the laity
in the diocese of York as require an ecclesiastical decision.
Given at the Lateran, on the tenth day before the calends of
January, in the fifth year of our pontificate."

Another Letter of the same pope on the same subject.

" Celestinus, the bishop, servant of the servants of God, to
his venerable brother, the bishop of Lincoln, and his dearly
beloved sons, the archdeacon of Northampton and the prior of
Pontefract, health and the Apostolic btfoediction. Inasmuch
as the holy Roman Church, being founded with perpetual stabi-
lity upon an immoveable foundation, that is to say, upon a stone
squared and true, the Truth, thus speaking of Himself ' Upon
this rock will I build my church,' 41 has, through the merits of
Saint Peter, received the governance and primacy over all
other churches, the Lord commanding the chief of the Apostles,
1 If thou lovest me, feed my sheep ;' 42 and has received ju-
dicial power not only over bodies, but over souls, the same
Chief of the Apostles hearing it said by the Lord, ' Whatever
thou shalt bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven' 43 we,
whom not our own merits, but the Divine mercy alone, has
summoned to the elevation of the Supreme Pontificate, if we
wish to form our judgments with true and prudent delibera-
tion, and not to abuse the power to us entrusted, ought, so far
as human frailty will permit us, to follow the example of him
by whom the Apostolic See was founded, and from whom she
has received the care of the other churches, and the fulness of the
power of binding and of loosing. For God is wondrous above all
things, and inscrutable are the depths of the divine wisdom; and
yet, although incomprehensible are His judgments, and unsearch-
able His ways, still, from the things that He works among us here
below, if we look upon them aright, He suggests to us and the
other prelates of the churches something for imitation in the
form of His judgments ; inasmuch as, when, according to the

St. Matt, xviii. 18. St. John, xxi. 16, 17.

account contained in the Gospel, he gave orders for the bar-
ren tree in his vineyard to be cut down, that it might not
cumber the ground, he prefaced the same, saying : ' Be-
hold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig-tree and
find none ; therefore cut it down ;' 44 we, though but the least,
and subject to the defects of human frailty, considering the
same with constant meditation within ourselves, on hearing
the excesses of the archbishop of York, and the rumours of
his disgraceful mode of life and his frivolous conversation
being repeated in the hearing of ourselves and of our brethren,
we did not immediately form a judgment against him, but,
after the manner of Him whose mercies are beyond the rest of
His works, ceased not, by multiplied letters and mandates,
to exert ourselves, for no small period of time, for his correc-
tion, that the barren tree might shoot forth to fruit, and recover
the vigour which it had lost ; at one time, by our admonitions,
recalling him to the ways of salvation, at another, by threats
of suspension from his duties and benefices, deterring him from
the paths of his iniquity and error, as, indeed, we believe is
manifest to yourselves, who have known the whole circum-
stances of the case, and the whole process of these matters, in
the order in which they have taken place. And whereas it
has come to our hearing, from the information of the clergy
and the chapter of the church of York, and the testimonies of
our dearly beloved sons, Robert of York, and Roger of Selby,
and eleven other abbats of the Pramonstratensian order, seem
manifestly to declare the same, that Geoifrey, archbishop of
York, disregarding the oaths of the office entrusted to him,
uselessly occupying himself with hunting and hawking, and
other military pursuits, has, since his promotion, given neither
hand nor thought to the ordination of the clergy, dedication of
churches, or the celebration of synods, nor yet has pronounced a
benediction on any abbat, although both against clergy and abbats
he has accustomed himself indiscreetly to let loose his tongue,
at his own will and pleasure, for the purpose of uttering male-
dictions and pronouncing sentence of excommunication. The
liberties and approved customs of the Church he nullifies and sub-
verts, appeals, which are wont to be the refuge of the oppressed,
he has, to the injury of the Roman See, brought into contempt, and
many persons, because they have made appeal to ourselves, he
has ordered to be thrown into prison and placed in irons. The
44 St. Luke, xiii. 7.

beneficed clergy of the church, after appeal made to us, he has
spoiled of dignities and benefices, and some of the canons, des-
pising their appeal, he has subjected to excommunication. In
his presence the privileges of the lloman Pontiffs are utterly de-
prived of all authority, and he who, under other circumstances,
would probably have been safe by pleading our privilege in his
presence, loses the benefit of the protection he thereby hoped to
gain. When it so happens that any one has been restored to a
church or possession by the judges delegate through our autho-
rity, the person by whom the said judgment is to be put in exe-
cution, he immediately looks upon as an enemy. Indeed, many
so restored he has reduced to destitution, and entering their
churches by means of his servants by force, is said to have
broken down the doors of the churches, and by violent means
expelled them. Many persons also he has perniciously made to
incur the danger of perjury, withdrawing them by means of
violent compulsion from the obedience which by oath they had
canonically promised his archdeacons to observe. Still more,
attacking the greater church with a multitude of anped men,
he has caused the door of the chapter house to be broken open
by force, and to be carried away ; the property of the canons,
and that of many other persons who had deposited their posses-
sions in the church as though in a treasury, he has caused to
be violently withheld from them ; respecting all which matter the
chaplain of York has made appeal to our presence. We have
also understood, from the testimony of the persons before-named,
that sometimes, when churches were vacant, he has not ad-
mitted fit and proper persons when presented by those to whom
the presentation belongs, but has given the same to either
youths or persons of bad character, thus discharging the duty
both of him who presents and of him who institutes ; or else
at his own will and option, he causes them to be vacated, in
order that their revenues may be applied to his own use : and
that which was intended for the sustenance of some worthy
clerk, he does not hesitate to keep in his own hands. They
have also stated, in addition, that whereas spiritual gifts ought
to be bestowed without reward and without corruptness, fre-
quently, when he bestows a benefice, he either splits it into
two parts, contrary to the canonical statutes of the church, or
else retains upon it a new and unusual charge ; and many who
had been excommunicated or suspended, he has absolved through
the intervention of nothing else than money. In his sight

religious and honest men are despised and condemned, while
low and suspected persons easily obtain his familiar acquaint-
anceship and favour. "Wherefore we, hearing of rumours so
disgraceful, not once but many times, and that by the letters
both of the aforesaid parties as also of others in the kingdom
of England and in the province of York, after having frequently
given ear thereto, wishing to withhold him from these ex-
cesses, and to recall him to the performance of the duties of the
pastoral office, have thought proper to entrust to you the in-
quiry into these reports, that convening the abbats, priors,
and other ecclesiastical persons of the diocese of York, you
might make diligent enquiry on the matters aforesaid, and if
lawful accusers should come forward against him, after hearing
what is alleged on the one side and on the other, reducing the
deposition of the witnesses to writing, make it your duty to
transmit to the Apostolic See their attestations, signed with
your seals, assigning to each party a fitting time within which
to present themselves before us, for the purpose of hearing sen-
tence pronounced. "We also remember that there was inscribed
in the some letters, that in case of accusers not being forth-
coming, and if public report should be in his disfavour, you
were, all obstacle of appeal removed, to call upon him to
clear himself with [the oaths of] three bishops and as many
abbats. And if he should chance to make any default
therein, you were of our own authority to denounce him as
suspended from all pontifical duties, and the management of
the archbishopric. But inasmuch as the said archbishop, be-
fore he was cited by you to a hearing, as he informed us
by his letters and his deputies, had thought fit to appeal to
the Apostolic See, and you assigned him the calends of January
as the term for prosecuting the said appeal, being disposed to
be considerate of his exertions and expenses, and fearing that
if he should come to the city in the hot season, some danger
might result to his person from the inclemency of the weather,
as soon as it had been intimated to us that he had set out
upon his journey, for the purpose of coming to the Apostolic
See, and was prepared to make answer on the offences im-
puted to him, we, in accordance with the wonted benefi-
cence of the Apostolic See, thought proper to put off the
time of making his appeal from then until the octave of
Saint ^iartin last past, suspending all that had been deter-
mined on against him until the said time, and recalling to its



382 ANJTALS OF EOGER DE HOVEDEX. A,D. 11DG.

former state whatever had been done by us or by others after
appeal made to us on presentation of his first letter. We did
also, by our Apostolic writings, distinctly command you, that
unless he should present himself before us, on the octave of
Saint Martin, according to the form of our first commission, in
such case, all obstacle of any gainsaying or appeal whatsoever
removed, you were on no account to delay to proceed against
him. But inasmuch as the before-named archbishop, abusing
our patience, has neither come to the Roman Church, nor sent
any proxy to excuse his absence, even when in our mercy,
we made it our. care to wait for him no small time beyond
the period that had been appointed for him, although he
seemed to have made confession as to the changes, in neglecting
to appear before us, we have only thought proper to suspend him
from the use of the pall, and from the execution of all episcopal
duties, and from the administration of all matters, spiritual as
well as temporal, and from the receipt of the revenues of the
church of York, and of that province ; that so, at least, coming
to a proper sense, from the pertinacity of his iniquity, he may
not require the censures of canonical severity to be exercised
against him with still greater rigour. "We do, therefore, by
these Apostolic writings, command your discretion, and en-
join that you will publicly announce him as suspended by us
throughout all the churches of the diocese and province of
York, strictly enjoining all the clergy and laity of that pro-
vince, in our name, not to presume to make answer to the said
archbishop, or to his officers, in matters temporal or spiritual,
until we shall have thought proper to come to some other deter-
mination as to the said archbishop. We do also command and
will, that it shall be announced by you in the diocese of York,
that, if any questions shall chance to be mooted between any
persons, which ought to be determined by ecclesiastical decision,
they are to take the same for the hearing of our dearly beloved
son, Simon, the dean of York, to whom, in conjunction with
the council of the canons residing in the same church, we both
entrust the correction of the excesses of the clergy, and the
decision of controversies existing between both clergy and
laity, and humbly to receive his judgment, and strictly to ob-
serve the same. In addition to which, all provisions, which on
the authority of our letters, before our second notification had
reached you, you have prudently and reasonably made in matters
relative to the said archbishop, both as to the restitution of what



A.D. 119G. DEPRIVATION OF THE AltCHBISHOP OF YOEK. 383

has been taken away by him, as also other matters, we have
thought proper to remain in force, as fully ratified by us ; and
we do command you, relying upon our authorization, to repair
to the church of York, according to the tenor of our first letters,
both for the purpose of enquiry into these evil reports, and for
making restitution to the canons of the things of which they
have been deprived, and to proceed therein, appeal or absence of
the aforesaid archbishop, or any letters hitherto obtained to the
prejudice of our first letters, notwithstanding. And further, on
the authority of these presents, we do enjoin you, that you
pronounce to be utterly null and void the sentence of excom-
munication pronounced upon certain canons, vicars, clerks, and
servants of the canons of the church of York, by the said arch-
bishop, after appeal made to us ; taking care, however, for the
sake of greater precaution, to absolve the said canons, and others
named in the said sentence, by the authority of the Apostolic See.
Also, all those who have rashly laid hands upon Benedict, clerk
of the above-named dean, Walter, the priest, Richard de Semare,
and the five clerks of Cavel, and other clerks of the church of
York, or have commanded violence to be used against them, you
are to pronounce, all power of appeal removed, to be placed under
the ban of excommunication, until they shall have made fitting
satisfaction to those who have suffered this injury, and have
come, with the testimony of your letters, to the Apostolic See,
for the purpose of there obtaining absolution. If all of you
shall be unable to take part in carrying out these injunctions,
then any two of you may carry out the same. Given at the
Lateran, on the tenth day before the calends of January, in the
fifth year of our pontificate/'

Accordingly, upon the authority of these letters, the officers
of the archbishop of York were deprived, although Hubert,
archbishop of Canterbury, the legate of the Apostolic See, had
again given them leave to continue in performance of their
duties, after having first suspended them because they had re-
fused to entertain him at York, as legate. All power was, there-
fore, according to the tenor of the Apostolic mandate, handed
over to Simon, the dean of York ; and the king's servants put
in the royal purse all the property and possessions of the said
archbishop.

In the meantime, Hubert, archbishop of Canterbury, wrote
to the officers of the archbishopric of York, to the following
effect :



384 ASTXALS OF ROGER DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 119G.

The Letter of Hubert, archbishop of Canterbury, to the officers of
the archbishopric of York.

" Hubert, by the grace of God, archbishop of Canterbury,
primate of all England, and legate of the Apostolic See, to his
dearly beloved sons in Christ, the officers of the archbishopric
of York, health in the Lord. We have received letters from
our lord the pope to the following effeet : ' Celestinus, the
bishop, servant of the servants of God, to his venerable brother
Hubert, archbishop of Canterbury, and legate of the Apostolic
See, health, and the Apostolic benediction. On your part it
was alleged, in our presence, that there are many in England
who have assumed the cross of our Lord, in order that they
might visit the sepulchre of the Lord, and give opportune aid
to that holy land upon which had stood the feet of our Lord ;
and although they are in a position to be able to fulfil their
vow, still, to the danger of their souls, they are withholding
themselves therefrom. There are some also, who, although
they have assumed the cross, are still unable to fulfil the vow
they have undertaken in such manner as they ought, in conse*
quence of poverty, infirmity of body, or other just cause. But,
inasmuch as your brotherhood has thought proper to consult
us with reference to what was to be done with these, we do,
on the authority of these presents, give you for answer, and by
these Apostolical writings enjoin you, that all those who have
taken such vow as above- stated, and have means enough to
enable them to do the same, unless they shall have a just
reason to prevent them from so doing, you will, by ecclesias-
tical censure, all power of appeal removed, compel to perform
the vow which they are said gratuitously to have made. But
as to those who, through poverty and infirmity of body, or
any other just impediment, are unable, as they ought, to fulfil
a vow which they are known to have taken, we do will that
when the truth as to these matters shall have been declared
unto you, enjoining on them a suitable penance, you shall give
them leave to remain ; strictly enjoining them that, as soon as
full liberty shall have been given them of carrying out their
vow, they are without delay not to postpone doing the same.
But as to those who, on account of infirmity, you shall be satis-
fied cannot possibly, under any circumstances, in their own
persons fulfil their vows, let them send one fit and proper per-
son, or more (according as their means will allow), beyond

sea, at their own expense, to serve for one year or more at their
will, there to serve in obedience to Jesus Christ. Given at the
Lateran, on the second day before the ides of January, in the
fifth year of our pontificate.' Therefore, inasmuch as it is a
perilous thing to vow and not to perform, since the result of
vows that have been solemnly made and not performed, is both
the anger of the Lord, and the rise of offences in His house, we
do, on the authority of the letter which we have transcribed,
by our precept, command you forthwith to make diligent and
anxious enquiry throughout each parochial church of the arch-
bishopric of York respecting those who, having assumed the
cross for the purpose of repairing to the sepulchre of the Lord,
have not performed their vow so made to the Lord ; forbidding
universally under threat of excommunication, that through the
insane taciturnity of any person the truth shall be suppressed to
the prejudice of this scrutiny ; and after either their own ad-
missions, or your unerring enquiries, shall have signified the
names of each person, let the same, distinctly stated by a trusty
messenger, be made known to us before the Lord's day on which
is sung ' Latare Jerusalem'^ In addition to which, we do
command and enjoin your discreetness, that, maintaining with
constant zealousness the cause of Him who was crucified, you
will try to prevail upon all such in the diocese of York, by
means of charitable exhortations and frequently conversing
with them thereupon, persuading them, under the form of ad-
vice, that they should faithfully fulfil what they have liberally
promised, and that what they have vowed unto the Lord in
the sight of all His people, they should perform with His prophet
in the midst of Jerusalem, in the courts of the house of the Lord.
And thus, by their voluntary sacrifices may the most High be
appeased, and, their payments duly made, may the annoyance
of these offences be nullified. You are also to advise the persons
aforesaid, all and each of them, that they shall, as a sign of
true devotion, before the day of our Lord's Passion next ensuing,
reassume the cross which they have laid aside, and, bearing the
same with reverence and veneration, protest by this outward
sign against the perverseness by which they are inwardly en-
thralled ; and let them not from poorness of spirit be ashamed
of that from which they will obtain full and abundant fruit.
But if they shall rather despise warnings of this nature as vain,

or shall pertinaciously close their ears against listening to the
same as obdurate, to the end that lawlessness may not be
granted them by reason of their going unpunished, you are to
take care to have it published by general notice, that all who
shall not for the performance of their vow have resumed the
cross which they had laid aside, within the time named, shall,
at the ensuing Easter of our Lord, beyond a doubt be excluded
from receiving the body of Christ and the communion of the
faithful. But, in order that the words of such warning may
not be thought or deemed to be frivolous, or to be wanting in
due effect, we do will, and, by the Apostolic authority, com-
mand, that the aforesaid punishment shall, on the said day, be
inflicted entirely according to the form, and quite as fully as is
herein-before stated, upon all who shall show themselves contu-
macious. For in this way from the homely seed of rigour, it will
shoot up hereafter as the fruit thereof, that the authority of
prelates will be weighed with a truer balance against canonical
severity ; 46 and those who shall be ready to rush into contempt,
will be less audacious in expecting a full indemnity. Fare-
well."

In the same year, after the feast of Saint Hilary, Philip,
king of France, and Richard, king of England, had an interview
at Louviers, where, after holding conference with their retainers,
the following terms were agreed to : the king of France quitted
claim to the king of England and his heirs, on part of himself
and his heirs, of Issodun with its appurtenances, and of all right
which he had in Berry, Auvergne, and Gascony, and gave him
quiet possession of the castle of Arches, the county of Auch,
the county of Aumarle, and many other castles which he had
taken during the war. In return for this, the king of England
quitted claim to the king of France of the castle of Gisors, and
the whole of the Norman Yexin ; and that all these terms
might be ratified, they determined between themselves on a
penalty of fifteen thousand marks of silver, so that he who
shouMbreak this peace, should pay to the other fifteen thousand
marks of silver ; and, as to the same, they found sureties on
either side.

The king of France also demanded for himself Andely, a
manor which belonged to the archbishop of Rouen ; and when
he could on no account obtain it, he demanded fealty to be done

to him, by Walter the archbishop of Eouen, for that part of the
archbishopric which lies in France, namely, in the French
Vexin. However, the archbishop of Rouen, seeing that this
was grievous and disgraceful to himself, appealed to our lord
the pope, as to the interests of his church, and departed, fear-
ing lest his lord, the king of England, would compel him to
do this, to gain the favour of the king of France.

ambition, how ever blind ! presumption most disgraceful !
0, how much does he lose of his right, who grasps at what is
not his right ! For Philip, king of France in attacking an earthly
kingdom, assaults a heavenly one; hankering after things worldly
he rushes upon things Divine ; doomed to wickedness, prompt
to run into peril, ready for criminality, he considers not the
cause of innocence, repudiates all justice, confounds right and
wrong ; vice is his companion, equity is his hate, iniquity is ever
his friend; he lives by slaughter, he fortifies himself by bloodshed,
he reigns amid cruelty, with him everything is determined by
death, nothing is settled by love." "If Jove should hurl his
thunders as oft as men should sin, in a short time he would be
disarmed." 48

However, in process of time, the king of France repented
that he had made such an agreement with the king of England,
and, collecting a large army, laid siege to Aumarle ; on which,
the king of England ordered seizure to be made in every place
in his dominions, on either side of the sea, of all the goods
and possessions of the abbats of Marmoutier, Cluny, Saint
Penis, and la Charite. For the said abbats were sureties to the
king of England, that the king of France would observe the
above-named treaty ; and if he should not do so, they were to
pay to the king of England fifteen thousand marks.

In the same year, Eobert, earl of Leicester, after giving to
Philip, king of France, two thousand marks of silver, and quit-
ting claim to him of his castle of Pascy, was liberated from
captivity. In the same year, the king of England sent Philip,
the bishop elect of Durham, and the abbat of Caen to England,
for the purpose of making enquiry as to the levies of the justices
and the sheriffs, and their servants ; but while the said abbat
of Caen, on the Lord's day, being the day of the Passion of our
Lord, was dining with Hubert, archbishop of Canterbury, and

chief justiciary of all England, he was taken ill at table, and
died on the fifth dav after, at London. In the meantime, Philip,
king of France, took the castle of Aumarle by assault, and de-
stroyed it, on which, the king of England gave him three
thousand marks of silver, as a ransom for the knights and their
followers, who had been taken at Aumarle. After this, the
king of Erance took Novancourt by assault, while John, earl of
Mortaigne, brother of Richard, king of England, took the castle
of Jumieges.

In the same year, a disturbance arose between the citizens
of London. For, more frequently than usual, in consequence
of the king's captivity and other accidents, aids to no small
amount were imposed upon them, and the rich men, sparing their
own purses, wanted the poor to pay everything. On a certain
lawyer, William Fitz-Osbert by name, or Longbeard, becoming
sensible of this, being inflamed by zeal for justice and equity,
he became the champion of the poor, it being his wish that every
person, both rich as well as poor, should give according to his
property and means, for all the necessities of the state ; and
going across the sea to the king, he demanded his protec-
tion for himself and the people. Hubert Fitz- Walter, arch-
bishop of Canterbury and the king's justiciary, being greatly
vexed at this, issued orders that wherever any of the common
people should be found outside the city, they should be ar-
rested as enemies to the king and his realm. Accordingly, it
so happened, that at Mid-Lent some of the merchants of the
number of the common people of London were arrested at the
fair at Stamford, by command of the king's justiciary.

The said justiciary then gave orders that the above named
William Longbeard should be brought before him, whether he
would or no ; but when one of the citizens, Geoffrey by name,
came to take him, the said Longbeard slew him ; and on others
attempting to seize him, he took to flight with some of his
party, and they shut themselves in a church, the name of which
is the church of Saint Mary at Arches, and, on their refusing
to come forth, an attack was made upon them. When even
then they would not surrender, by command of the archbishop
of Canterbuiy, the king's justiciary, fire was applied, in order
that, being forced by the smoke and vapour, they might come
forth. At length, when the said William came forth, one of
them, drawing a knife, plunged it into his entrails, and he
was led to the Tower of London, where he was condemned to

be hanged. Accordingly, lie was tied to the horse's tail, and
dragged through the lanes and streets of the city to the gibbet, 49
where he was hanged, together with eight of his confederates.
The other citizens of London who had joined him, threw them-
selves upon the king's mercy, and gave hostages as security
that they would keep the peace towards the king and his realm.

The monks, however of the Holy Trinity at Canterbury, on
hearing that their church at London, called Saint Mary at
Arches, 50 had been thus subjected to violence by order of their
archbishop (who, although he was a servant of the king, ought
still to have kept the rights of the Church inviolate), were indig-
nant thereat, and their heart was grieved at him, and they were
unable to hold communication with him on any matter in a
peaceable manner.

In the same year, Bichard, king of England, gave to his
nephew, Otho, the earldom of Poitou. In the same year, also,
when the countess of Brittany had come, by command of king
jRichard, into Normandy, for the purpose v of holding a con-
ference with him, Ranulph, earl of Chester, her husband, went
to meet her at Pont D'Urse, and took her and shut her up in
his castle at Saint James de Beverun. "When her son Arthur
found himself unable to procure her release, be became an
adherent of the king of France, and ravaged the territories of
the king, his uncle, with conflagrations, on which the king of
England, collecting a large army, entered Brittany in a hostile
manner, and laid it waste.

In the meantime, Geoffrey, archbishop of York, having at
length arrived at the Apostolic See, made a long stay there,
and, in transacting all matters relative to himself, he found
the pope very hard to be moved, and vexed with him beyond
measure. In process of time, however, a hearing was given
to him, and his adversaries then present; and when the matters
previously mentioned, and many other things, were alleged
against him, all of which the archbishop steadfastly asserted
to be false, his adversaries, being asked whether they were
ready to prove their allegations, made answer, after time for
deliberation had been asked and conceded to them, that they
were not willing to undertake the burden of proving the same.

The archbishop, however, sufficiently proved that he was
not guilty of the matters charged against him; and conse-
quently our lord the pope, by the advice of his whole court,
* 9 At Tyburn. M Bow Church, in Cheapside.

restoring him to his office and benefices, gave it as his com-
mand to all the prelates and other clergy appointed throughout
the diocese of York, that they should pay him due respect and
obedience in all things as archbishop ; stating also in his re-
script how the archbishop had shown that he was not guilty
of the matters charged against him, and that all that had
been spread abroad by his adversaries about him, was false
and fictitious.

On notice, however, of his restoration coming to the king of
England, who had already despoiled the archbishop of his tem-
poralities, and, as was said, was aiming, together with his ad-
versaries, at his deposition, he was greatly disturbed, and
commanded two of his adversaries to take upon themselves the
care of spiritual matters, and not allow the archbishop, or his
officers, to have any share in the management thereof. The
king, also, at his own will, gave and distributed among his
clerks the prebends of the church of York, and the other bene-
fices that were vacant. Accordingly, the archbishop of York
being on his return, and staying in France, did not dare to enter
the king's territories, on seeing that he could not find grace
in the sight of the king, so as to congratulate himself on being
in possession of either temporalities or spiritualities, but turned
back, and set out on his return to the Roman court.

In the meantime, our lord the king of England, at the re-
quest of Arthur, duke of Brittany, and of other influential
men, gave leave to Peter de Dinant to take proceedings against
Adam de Tournouere, as to the archdeaconry of the West Riding,
which the king had given to the said Adam. At length, an
agreement was come to between them, on the following terms :
Master Simon of Apulia, dean of the church of York, and the
chapter of that church, by the concession and consent of the
said Adam, were to receive Peter de Dinant as archdeacon of
the "West Riding, and instal him both in the chapter and the
choir ; and the said Peter gave the office of deputy, and the
management of the said archdeaconry, to the said Adam de
Tournouere, subject to an annual payment of sixty marks, provi-
ding that the said Adam should hold the said archdeaconry, and
every part thereof, all the days of his life, and should make
him thence an annual payment of sixty marks ; and if Peter
should survive Adam, then he was to receive the archdeaconry
of the West Riding, without any contradiction or diminution.
It was also agreed between them, that when they should both

be in York at the same time, one of them should occupy the
stall in the choir, as archdeacon, on the one day, and the other
the same on the next day, and that they should thus take their
turns every other day, so long as they should be staying at the
same time at York ; and, that this agreement, made between
them, might be ratified, and remain inviolate, the chapter of
York confirmed the same with their seal. But before knowledge
of this agreement had reached the archbishop of York, he sent
his letters patent into England, to the following effect :

" Geoffrey, by the grace of God, archbishop of York, and
primate of England, to the deans, priests, and all the clergy
throughout the archdeaconry appointed, health and the paternal
benediction. Be it known to all of you, that we, in considera-
tion of the love we bear to him, have given to Peter de Dinant,
our clerk, the archdeaconry of the West Riding, into which, as
we have been most credibly informed by many persons, Adam
de Tournouere has, by whose authority we know not, intruded
himself, and has usurped the name of archdeacon, although the
disposal of archdeaconries, dignities, and churches, in our arch-
bishopric, belongs to ourselves alone, on whom the same has,
by the Divine mercy, been bestowed. The said Adam has
also, by the instigation of the devil, since restitution made to
us by our lord the pope, exerted himself in the administration
of spiritual matters, against ourselves and our officers. Where-
fore we, rendering void, and by our authority, utterly nullifying
whatsoever the said Adam has done in institutions, in excom-
munications, in suspensions, and in other things which he has
done, under the name of archdeacon, do now excommunicate
the said Adam, enjoining you, and by virtue of your obedience
commanding you, not to answer him in any orders given by
him, but to consider him as excommunicated. We do also
notify unto you, that we do ratify and confirm the sentence
pronounced upon Paulinus de Eburford and others, who, con-
trary to the obedience which they owe to ourselves and others,
have obstructed our officers, Master Ralph de Kime, and Mas-
ter Honorius. Farewell."

In the same year, in the month of July, Philip, bishop elect
of Durham, was ordained priest, by Henry, bishop of Llandaff,
in the church of Saint Cuthbert, at Durham, on the seventeenth
day before the calends of July, being Saturday in the week of
Pentecost.

In the same year, William, king of the Scots, having collected



392 ANNALS OF EOGEE DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 11S6.

a large army, entered Moray, for the purpose of warring against
Harold Macmanud 50 who had taken possession of that territory;
but before the king arrived in Caithness, Harold fled to his
ships, being unwilling to engage with the king. On this, the
king of the Scots sent his army to Turreham, a town belonging
to the said Harold, and destroyed his castle at that place. Ac-
cordingly, Harold, perceiving that the king would entirely lay
waste his lands, came to the king's feet, and threw himself
upon his mercy, the more especially, as there was a storm raging
at sea, and the wind was contrary to him when attempting to
reach the Orkney islands : he also made oath to the king, that
he would bring to him all his enemies, on the next occasion
that the king should return to Moray, and on that account the
king allowed him to hold the moiety of Caithness : the other
moiety of Caithness the king gave to Harold the younger, the
nephew of Eeginald, former earl of Orkney and Caithness.

The king then returned into his territories, and Harold to
Orkney. After this, in the autumn, the king of the Scots re-
turned to Ilvernarran, in Moray, for the purpose of receiving
his enemies at the hand of Harold ; but, after Harold had
brought them to the port of Locloy, near Ilvernarran, he allowed
them to depart. The king returning late from the chase, Ha-
rold came to him, bringing with him two boys, his nephews,
for the purpose of delivering them to the king, as hostages ;
and on being asked by the king where his enemies were, whom
he was to deliver up to him, and where his son Torphin was,
whom he had promised to deliver to him as a hostage, he made
answer, " I let them go, knowing that if I delivered them to
you, they would not escape out of your hands ; and as for my
son, I could not bring him, because in this land I have no other
heir."

Consequently, because he had not observed the covenants
which he had made with his master, the king, he was con-
demned to remain in the king's custody, until his son should
appear and become a hostage ; and because he had allowed the
king's enemies to escape, he was adjudged to have forfeited the
lands which he held of the king. The king accordingly took
Harold with him to the castle of Edinburgh, and kept him in
prison until his people in Orkney had brought his son Torphin ;
on which, delivering him to their lord the king, as a hostage,
they released Harold from the king's custody, and he returned
50 V.r. Macmadit.

to Orkney, and there remained in peace and quietness, until
Harold the Younger, having obtained permission from Swere
"Birkebain, king of Norway, to claim a moiety of Orkney,
brought with him Siward Murd from Hegland, and many
other warriors, and invaded Orkney; on which, Harold the
Elder was unwilling to engage with him, but leaving Orkney,
went to the Isle of Man, where he collected a fleet and many
men.

Harold the Younger did the same, and came to the Isle of
Man, wishing to have an engagement with Harold the Elder ;
but the latter, before the arrival of Harold the Younger in
Man, departed with his fleet for Orkney by another road, and
slew all whom he found there. On hearing of this, Harold
the Younger returned to Wick, in Caithness, and there en-
gaged with Harold the Elder ; and in this battle the younger
Harold and the whole of his army were slain. On the death
of Harold the Younger, Harold the Elder came to the king of
the Scots, with the safe conduct of Roger and Reginald, the
bishops of Saint Andrew's and Ross, and offered the king a
large sum of gold and silver for liberty again to hold Caith-
ness : on which the king made answer, that he would give him
the said land if he would divorce his wife, the daughter of
Malcolm Mathar, and take back his former wife, the sister of
Duncan, earl of Fife, and deliver to him as hostages, Lauren-
tius, his clerk, and Bonavar, the son of Iggemund; which
Harold declined to do. Upon this, Reginald, son of Sumerled,
king of Man, came to "William, king of the Scots, and pur-
chased of him Caithness, saving to the king his yearly revenues
therefrom.

In the same year, Richard, king of England, gave to Wil-
liam de Chimely, archdeacon of Richmond, the bishopric of
Evreux, in Normandy ; and the said king gave to master
Eustace, his seal-bearer, the archdeaconry of Richmond.

In the same year, Hubert, archbishop of Canterbury, pri-
mate of the whole of England, and legate of the Apostolic
See, by his messengers, often and repeatedly entreated his
master, Richard, king of England, to relieve him from the
government of the kingdom, pointing out that he could not
possibly attend to both the government of the church and of
the kingdom. Although the king was unwilling to do this,
because there had been no one found like to him as a guardian






394 ANNALS OF ROGEE DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1196.

of the laws and ordinances of the kingdom ; still listening to
his entreaties, he expressed himself willing to relieve him of
the anxieties of government; on which he repented having
made such a request of the king, knowing by experience
that, for the guardianship of the laws, a heavy retribution
would be exacted. After examining his books and auditing
his accounts, he sent word to the king that, in the two
years last past, he had acquired for his use eleven hundred
thousand marks of silver from out of the kingdom of Eng-
land; adding thereto, that if his services should appear
necessary to him, he would not refuse the labour, nor yet
allege his declining years. 0, unhappy prelate ! although
he had so often read that "no man can love two masters, for
either he must hate the one and love the other, or else he will
hold to the one and despise the other;" 51 he still preferred to
neglect his sacerdotal duties, to which, by his vow, he had been
bound, he was not ashamed to appear in the camp of the king
of England. 62

In the same year, Richard, king of England, granted to
Philip, bishop elect of Durham, licence to coin money in his
city of Durham, which for a long period past had not been
granted to his predecessors. In this year, also, there was in
England, and in all its borders, a great famine and mortality
among men.

In the same year, the earl of Saint Gilles took to wife Joanna,
the sister of Richard, king of England, and former queen of
Sicily. In the same year died Henry, bishop of Worcester,
who was succeeded, at the presentation of king Richard, by
John de Coutances, dean of Rouen. In the same year died
William, earl of Salisbury, son of earl Patrick, whose daughter
and heiress Richard, king of England, gave to wife, together
with the earldom of Salisbury, to William, his bastard brother.

In the same year died Maurice, bishop of Paris. In this
year, also, died Bela, king of Hungary, after whose decease his
wife Margaret, sister of Philip, king of France, who had for-
merly been queen of England, and wife of king Henry the
Younger, assumed the cross and set out for Jerusalem, and
remained at Acre, in the land of Jerusalem, in the service of
God, until the end of her life. In the same year died Bu-

card, the treasurer of the church of York, whose treasurer-
ship Richard, king of England, gave to master Eustace, his
seal-bearer. In the same year died Peter de Ros, after whose
decease Richard, king of England, gave to Aimeric, nephew
of Philip, bishop elect of Durham, the archdeaconry of Car-
lisle ; and Philip, the bishop elect of Durham, gave to the
said Aimeric, his nephew, the archdeaconry of Durham and
the church of Acelet, which the before-named Bucard had
held.

In the same year, Richard, king of England, fortified a new
castle in the island of Andely, against the consent and prohi-
bition of Walter, archbishop of Rouen ; and because the king
would not desist from his purpose, the said archbishop pro-
nounced sentence of interdict upon Normandy, and then re-
paired to the Supreme Pontiff.

In the same year, a combat taking place between the fol-
lowers of the king of France and of the king of England^
Hugh de Chaumont, a valiant and wealthy knight, and a very
intimate friend of the king of France, was taken prisoner,
and delivered to the king of England ; on which the king of
England delivered him into the custody of Robert de Ros, and
Robert delivered him to "William de 1'Espinay, his retainer, to
keep in the castle of Bonville-sur-Toke ; who keeping a negli-
gent guard over him, by night he descended from the wall, with
the consent and connivance of the said William de 1'Espinay.
The king of England being greatly enraged at this, because
Hugh de Chaumont had thus made his escape from out of his
hands, took Robert de Ros and imprisoned him ; and exacted
from him twelve hundred marks of silver as his ransom ; and
William de 1'Espinay, who was a traitor to his lord, was hanged
on a gibbet.

In the same year, Ralph de Wigetof, a clerk of Geoffrey,
archbishop of York, was taken ill at Rouen, even to the point
of death, and, in the presence of our lord the pope and all the
cardinals, made confession that he had obtained many forged
letters in the court of Rome, both relative to the business of
his master, the archbishop of York, as also his own private
business, and that he had now sent them to England : where-
upon our lord the pope gave orders to Hubert, archbishop of
Canterbury, that if there should be any letters found relative
to the business of the archbishop of York, containing anything



396 ANNALS OF EOGEK DE 1IOVEDEX. A.D. 1197.

contrary to equity and justice, the same were to be retained in
his possession.

In consequence of this, Roger of Eipon, a clerk, the bearer
of these letters, who also carried poison with him, was found
at London, who said that Ralph de Wigetof had delivered them
to him. He also said that the poison had been given to him
for the purpose of making away with Master Simon, the dean
of the church of York, and some other persons, canons of
the said church. Accordingly, at the summons of Hubert,
archbishop of Canterbury, the king's justiciary, the said dean
of York came to London, and the poison was delivered to him,
with golden rings, and a very beautiful belt that was drugged
for the purpose of burning him ; at the delivery of which an
immense multitude of men and women assembled at the place
called Totehil 53 to witness the burning of them, where they
were accordingly committed to the flames, and reduced to
ashes : the bearer of them, however, was kept in confinement,
and the adversaries of Geoffrey, archbishop of York, cast all
the blame of the crime on him.

In the same year, John, earl of Mortaigne, the king's bro-
ther, and Marchades, the leader of the infamous tribe of the
Brabanters, on the fourteenth day before the calends of June,
being the second day of the week, made an excursion before
the city of Beauvais ; and while they were intent on the cap-
ture of booty, Philip, bishop of Beauvais, and William de
Merle, together with his son and many knights and armed people,
came forth from the city, being themselves in arms ; but they
were very quickly worsted in the combat, and the said bishop
of Beauvais, and William de Merle and his son, and several
knights were taken prisoners, and of the common people the
greater part was slain. On the same day, after this capture,
the earl John and Marchades proceeded to Milli, the castle of
the said bishop of Beauvais, and took it by assault, and levelled
it with the ground : and then, gloriously triumphing, they re-
turned to Normandy, and delivered to the king of England the
bishop of Beauvais, and Walter de Merle and his son, and
many others who had been taken prisoners.

In the year of grace 1197, being the eighth year of the

reign of Richard, king of England, the said Richard was at

Burun, in Normandy, on the day of the Nativity of our Lord,

which fell on the fourth day of the week, greatly vexed, be-

63 Tothill, in the vicinity of Westminster Abbey.

A.D. 1197. THE POPE'S ADVICE TO THE ARCHBISHOP OF EOUEN. 397

cause Walter, archbishop of Rouen, would not revoke the sen-
tence of interdict which he had laid upon Normandy ; for the
bodies of the dead were lying unburied throughout the lanes
and streets of the cities of Normandy. Accordingly, the king
sent William, bishop of Ely, his chancellor, to the bishop of
Lisieux, and Philip, the bishop elect of Durham, to plead his
cause in the presence of our lord the pope, against the said
archbishop of Rouen. On their arrival in Poitou, William, bishop
of Ely, the king's chancellor, fell ill, even unto death, and
died and was buried ; and, as long as he appeared to be in the
mortal agony, a wooden crucifix in the cathedral church of the
same city, which is called the cross of Saint Martial, was
seen to weep so vehemently, that streams of water, as it were,
poured down from its eyes, and moistened the face. The people
indeed said that this now happened for the third time ; the first
time at the death of a bishop of the said city, the second time on
the departure of John Belesmains, bishop of that city, and the
third time on the death of this William, bishop of Ely.

After his decease, the bishop of Lisieux, and the bishop elect
of Durham, proceeded upon the business of their master. Our
lord the king, however, not unmindful of the services which
the said chancellor had rendered him, gave to his brother Robert,
prior of Ely, the abbey of Saint Mary at York ; and Hubert,
archbishop of Canterbury, and legate of the Apostolic See, con-
secrated him abbat.

The said archbishop of Rouen, and the bishop of Lisieux,
and the bishop elect of Ely now meeting in the presence of our
lord the pope, the archbishop of Rouen asserted his right which
he had over Andely, and the injury which Richard, king of
England, had done him in fortifying a castle upon the pos-
sessions of the church of Rouen thus unjustly, and against his
will and consent. To this the above-named envoys of the king
made answer, that the king their master had often and repeatedly
made him offer, through his envoys, venerable men and dis-
creet bishops, abbats, earls, and barons, that he would make
him reparation in every respect, according to the estimate formed
by honorable men. For, as they asserted on the king' s behalf, he
could on no account give up the said island of Andely, on which,
he had fortified the castle, because the king of France and his
people every now and then were making inroads into Nor-
mandy, and frequently ravaged it, in consequence of which
the king of England had fortified that place for the defence of



398 ANNALS OF ROGER UE HOVEDEN. A .D. 1197.

his territory against the king of France. Upon these matters
the said archbishop of Eouen, and the aforesaid envoys of the
king submitted to the decision of our lord the pope and of the
Eoman Church. Accordingly, after our lord the pope and the
cardinals had long deliberated on the matter, considering the
losses and inconveniences that would result to Normandy, if
the said place of Andely should not be fortified, they advised
the said archbishop of Eouen to settle the matter with the king
his master on amicable terms, and to receive from him a suffi-
cient recompense for what had been taken from him, accord-
ing to an estimate formed by honorable and prudent men, saying,
that the king was fully at liberty, and indeed any potentate
was, to fortify the weaker portions of his territory, that injury
might not result therefrom to himself and his people.

In the meantime, our lord the pope Celestinus consecrated
Philip, the bishop elect of Durham, to the bishopric of Durham,
on the Lord's day on which is sung " Misericordia Domini"**
which in this year fell on the twelfth of May. The bishop of
Durham having been thus consecrated, pope Celestinus re-
voked the sentence of interdict which Walter, archbishop of
Eouen had pronounced against Normandy, on account of the
fortification of the castle of the island of Andely, and then
dismissed them. Accordingly, the said archbishop of Eouen,
and the bishops of Durham and Lisieux returned to our lord
Eichard, the king of England, with a form of reconciliation
between the said king and the archbishop of Eouen, drawn up
by the advice of our lord the pope, and the cardinals.

On this, the said king, having convened the bishops, abbats,
earls, and barons of Normandy, gave to "Walter, archbishop of
Eouen, and his successors, by way of compensation for his town
of Andely, the town of Dieppe with all its appurtenances,
the valley of Malendai, the mills of Eobec, in the city of
Eouen, and Louviers with its appurtenances, and by his charter
confirmed the same ; in return for which, Walter, archbishop
of Eouen, quitted claim to Eichard, king of England, and his
heirs, of Andely with its appurtenances, on the part of himself
and his successors.

In the same year, Eichard, king of England, came to Saint
Valery, and burned that town to the ground, and having de-

earth is full of the mercy of the Lord."

stroyed the monks that were there in the service of God,
carried away with him into Normandy the shrine, with the
relics of Saint Valery : in that harbour he also found some
ships, which had come from England, laden with corn and pro-
visions, on which he seized them and ordered the sailors in
them to be hanged, and then burned the ships, and distributed
the corn and provisions among his people.

In the same year, the people of Champagne and Flanders,
and the Bretons, deserting the king of France, 'became ad-
herents of the king of England, hostages being given on either
side that they would not come to a reconciliation, nor make
peace with the king of France, unless with the common con-
sent of both parties. For the king of England had brought
over them, and nearly all the most powerful men of the king-
dom of France, with presents ; as his bounteous hand in its
gifts surpassed all other gifts. " Nor yet in giving does he
go beyond all bounds ; nay rather, to each he assigns a purpose
fixed and definite." 56

Accordingly, he gave to Baldwin, earl of Flanders, for his
assistance five thousand marks of silver ; and he gave hostages
that he would not make peace with the king of France, unless
with the consent [of the king of England, and the king of
England did the same with him. After this, William Crespin,
constable of Anjou, being compelled by force, surrendered to
Richard, king of England, the castle of Anjou, which the king
immediately placed in a sufficient state of defence with men,
arms, and provisions ; and the king of France shortly after
assembling a large army laid siege to it. While these things
were going on, Eichard, king of England, proceeded to Auvergne,
and took ten of the castles of the king of France and of his
followers. But before the king of England could return to
Normandy, the king of France took the castle of Anjou, granting
to the knights and men-at-arms therein safety to life and limb ;
and after he had levied from them five hundred marks of silver
for their ransom, he gave them liberty to depart, and fortified
the castle and retained it in his own hands.

In the meantime, Baldwin, earl of Flanders, laid siege to
the castle of Arras ; on hearing of which, the king of France
came thither with a numerous army. Upon his approach,
the earl of Flanders raising the siege, returned into his own

* " Nee tamen in dando mensuram deserit, immo,
Singula describit certo moderamine finis."

territories, the king of France pursuing him. When the king
of France had proceeded to a considerable distance, the earl of
Flanders caused the bridges to be broken down that lay both
in front and rear of the king of France, so that neither pro-
visions nor his army could come near him. Upon this, the king
of France being placed in a dilemma, entreated the earl of
Flanders that he would not cast a blot on the crown of France,
alleging that he had entered Flanders with the intention of
making amicable arrangements with him, and swearing that he
would give him all his rights if he would forsake Eichard,
king of England, without making peace with him. As the
earl of Flanders declined to act in contravention of the terms
which he had made with the king of England, a conference
took place between the king of France and the king of England,
on the fourth day of the week after the Exaltation of the holy
Cross, between Gaillon and Andely ; and so, the king of France,
escaping capture by the earl of Flanders, returned into France,
but would observe none of the covenants he had made with
the earl of Flanders.

In the same year, Eichard, king of England, gave to Master
Eustace, his vice-chancellor, the bishopric of Ely. In the
same year, Joanna, sister of Eichard, king of England, and
wife of Eaymond, earl of Saint Gilles, was delivered of her
first-born son, and his name was called Eaymond. In the
same year died king Eees, the son of Griffin ; 58 after whose
death a dissension arose among his sons, which of them should
reign in the place of their father ; for the purpose of putting
an end to which, Hubert, archbishop of Canterbury, the king's
justiciary, repaired to the "Welch territory, and established
peace between them.

In the mean time, Philip, bishop of Beauvais, having sent
his brother, the bishop of Orleans, to Eome, while he was still
in captivity with the king of England, wrote to Celestinus, the
Supreme Pontiff, to the following effect :

The Letter of Philip, bishop of Beauvais, to Celestinus, the

Pontiff, Philip, bishop of Beauvais, health and duteousness in

ing to mind that maxim of the law, * He invites the guiltless
to offend who passes the guilty by unpunished.' It is a thing
now almost notorious to all the churches, how disrespectfully,
and how inhumanly, the king of England has, for some time
past, been in rebellion against his lord, the king of tlfe Pranks ;
like a man who, fastening a rope round a large mountain, tries
to throw it down. Accordingly, bringing with him fire and
sword, and supported by apostate companies of Brabanters, he
has made attacks upon our country, ravaging it on every side.
Upon seeing this, being not unmindful of the legal maxim, 'It
is lawful to repel force by force/ and of that other one, ' Fight
for your country,' mingling in the throng of warriors and
citizens, and in the ranks of the nobles, I went forth to meet
the enemy in their onward career. But fortune, that step-
dame of human counsels, brought my intended purpose to an
unhappy result ; for there I was taken prisoner, and thrown
into heavy chains and fetters ; neither the dignity of my order,
nor reverence for God, afforded me any relief or mitigation.
In such wise, then, the king of England has not dreaded to
rage against Christ, our Lord, after the manner of a wolf. Nor
do I suppose that this has been unknown to your ears. Why,
then, do you dissemble ? "What father would see his son doing
wrong, and be silent thereon ? Who would not chasten his
son with a rod, that he might not run upon a sword ? The
father despairs of his son, when he chasteneth him not with
threatening, or with the whip. Indeed, it is clearer than light
itself, that the king of England, and the rest of his accomplices,
who have violently laid hands on us, have rendered themselves
subject to the visitations I have above mentioned ; wherefore,
attentively listening to the injuries done to ourselves, and the
grievous enormities committed against your fatherly affection,
do with mercy condescend to listen to our tears, and to our
petition. For it were an unworthy thing that the petition,
made to you by those subject to you, should return useless and
of no effect ; one too that savours of all humility, and that is
based on the firm support of reason. ' He, in fact, is not en-
tirely free from a fault, who, when he can correct it, pretends
that he cannot rectify it ; nor is he free from some suspicion
of secret connivance, who forbears to prevent a manifest mis-
deed.' 59 Wherefore, holy father, do not wonder that I have
to such a length multiplied the words of sorrow. Perpetual

grief knows not how to, indeed cannot, be buried in the recesses
of the breast ! I bid your fatherly goodness farewell."

The Rescript of pope Cekstinus, to Philip, bishop of Beawais.

" Celestinus, the bishop, servant of the servants of God, to
his dearly beloved brother, Philip, bishop of Beauvais, health,
and a speedy return from his course of error. That it has
turned out unfortunately for you, is not to be wondered at.
For ' He deserves the hatred of all men, who shows himself to
be the common enemy of all.' For, throwing aside the peace-
ful bishop, you have assumed the warlike knight, in your
rashness perverting the order and course of things, you have
borne the shield in place of the chasuble, the sword in place
of the stole, the hauberk for the alb, the helmet for the mitre,
and the banner for the pastoral staff ; not wishing, as you
allege, to repel violence but valour, by violence ; not fighting
for your 'country, but against your country. For, as to your
Gaul, we may now publicly declare, ' Woe to thee, land,
when thy king is a child !' 60 For he, having corporeally
made oath to the king of the English, was bound to observe
the same, as faithfully maintaining the integrity of his
cities and of his territories, at least until his return from his
pilgrimage. Whereas, shamefully contravening his plighted
faith and his oath, coming to the cities of the aforesaid king,
he has violently seized them, and, with hostile hand, has cruelly
laid waste his territories. Eeturning at length from the scene
of his labours, that king has manfully met your king, placing
his trust not in multitudes, but in the Lord ; for not by the
amount of men or of might, but by the virtue of the cause is
the battle gained. In behalf of the king of England, humility
has hitherto been fighting against pride, justice and equity
against injustice, moderation and modesty against arrogance
and intemperance. For, defended by numerous virtues and not
by men, do persons gain the victory. The laws and ordinances
permit an injury, when done by arms, to be repelled by the
remedy of arms ; consequently, at last, late though it be, the
king of England has manifested himself and his anger ; inas-
much as it is hardly possible that valour, closed up, can lie con-
cealed, the warmth of anger be extinguished and the small
spark of prowess be shut up ; for valour knows not how to lie-
concealed, and the smothered fire breaks forth into flame.
Added to this, you have shown yourself not only the unbridled

counsellor of your master's frenzy, but also an accomplice as
foolish as insolent ; you sought and you have found ; you struck,
and struck again, you have been levelled with the ground ; into
the pit which you have made you have deservedly fallen ; where
you have been found, there you have been judged- accordingly.
According as we understand from the tenor of your letters
directed to us, imputing to us the excesses of your country,
you strive to throw the fault upon us, asserting that we are
luke-warm and dissemblers. What now, is to be the con-
sequence if the sheep turn upon the shepherd, if the son rises
against the father ? There will not be a shepherd who will
not have cause to repent that he fed the sheep, not a father
who will not regret that he brought up his son. Wherefore
it is a hurtful weapon for a man, to soften down malignant
craftiness under the guise of simplicity. Still, we have ad-
dressed letters of entreaty to the king of England in your be-
half; for after examining most thoroughly the circumstances
of your captivity, we cannot and ought not in such a case to
command, but only to entreat. The conqueror then must
be overcome by the resources of wisdom, for it is written,
' Wisdom excels folly.' 61 For which reason it is that we en-
treat in your behalf not importunately, but opportunely. For
an importunate urging of entreaty is a proof of distrust, and
patient waiting gains its object more easily than importunate
demands extort the same. But in the meantime, consigned
to chains and lamentations, do you resignedly and patiently
endure those chains, according to the words of the poet,
' Whatever you endure deservedly, you must bear resignedly ;
the punishment that comes undeservedly, comes as a cause
for grief;' 62 and that deservedly requires to be expiated with
lamentations, which the belly has gained at the expense of its
shame. Given, &c."

In the same year died William, bishop of Poitiers, and, al-
though his life had seemed to. men very reprehensible, still after
his death he was distinguished by miracles. In the same year,
Philip, king of France, and Eichard, king of England, agreed
upon a truce for one year from the feast of Saint Hilary, in-
tending once more to make between them a peace and final

reconciliation. After this, Baldwin, earl of Flanders, came into
England on a pilgrimage to Saint Thomas the Martyr, of
Canterbury. In the same year, the son of Henry, emperor 01
the Komans, whom the empress Constance, daughter of Roger,
the former king of Sicily, had borne to him, was baptized, and
his name was called Frederic.

In the same year, Jordan de Courcy, brother of John de
Courcy, prince of the kingdom of Ulster, in Ireland, was slain
by an Irishman, a member of his household. For the purpose
of avenging his death, the before-named John, his brother,
fought a battle with the petty kings of Ireland, of whom he
put some to flight, slew others, and subjugated their territories ;
of which he gave no small part to Dunecan, son of Gilbert, the
son of Fergus, who, at the time that the said John was about
to engage with the Irish, came to assist him with no small body
of troops.

In the same year, Nicholas, bishop of Wic, in Norway,
fought a battle with Swere Birkebain, and being routed by
him, took to flight, nearly all his followers being slain. In
the same year, the before-named bishop of Orleans, who had
gone to Rome to procure the liberation of his brother Philip,
died at Sens la Vielle. In the same year, Henry, emperor of
the Romans, sent a great army into the land of Sulia, under
the command of the bishop of Mentz, Henry, duke of Saxony,
count palatine of the Rhine, the duke of Louvaine, the duke
de Saringes, the duke of Austria, son of duke Leopold, the
duke of Suabia, the duke of Bavaria, Walran, brother of the
duke of Lemburg, and many counts.

The said "Walran landed with his forces, before the rest, in the
land of Jerusalem, and immediately attacked the pagans, and,
slaying as many of the pagans as he could, violated the peace
and truce which the king of England, at his departure from
the land of Jerusalem, had agreed to between the Christians
and the pagans. Saphadin, the brother of Saladin, and the
other pagans, being greatly enraged at this, slew all the Chris-
tians they could find, and laid siege to Joppa. On this,
Henry, count of Champagne, who, by the election of the kings
of France and of England, and of the Templars and Hospitallers,
had the chief command in the land of Jerusalem, assembled the
army of the Christians for the purpose of raising the siege ; but
while he was leaning against the pillar of a window in an upper
room, addressing the multitude, the pillar gave way, and, falling



A.D. 1197. AKBEST OF THE NOBLES OF SICILY. 405

to the ground, he broke his neck, and expired ; shortly after,
the Saracens took Joppa, and slew in it more than twenty
thousand Christians.

After the death of Henry, count of Champagne, the duke of
Louvaine, and Henry, duke of Saxony, withdrew to the city
of Acre ; but they were in possession of no territory beyond the
gates of the city, and no provisions could be brought to them,
through fear of the pagans. In the meanwhile, the army of
the emperor, which had proceeded by sea on its road to Jeru-
salem from Germany and other parts of his territories, made
its way past Normandy and England ; and then, holding straight
onward in its course for Spain, rescued the city of Silves from
the hands of the pagans ; which, however, they utterly de-
stroyed, not leaving stone upon stone ; for they feared that if
they should give it into the charge of the king of Portugal, he
would lose it as he had done before.

In this pilgrimage of the troops of the people of the said
emperor, an unusual miracle occurred, and one unheard-of by
mankind. It so happened that two Germans, who were neigh-
bours and friends, engaging in a partnership, agreed that during
the pilgrimage to Jerusalem they would go together, sharing
their lodging and their expenses. When the time for de-
parture was close at hand, one of them came to the house of
the other to lodge there that night ; and after he had shown to
the master of the house the money which he was going to take
with him upon the journey, the latter, by the advice of his wife
murdered him, and took his money, and then placing the body of
the murdered man on his shoulders, set out for the purpose of
throwing him into a river ; but [on arriving there] he could
by no possible means cast him away ; so returning at daybreak
with the body fast upon his shoulders, he lay in concealment
for three days. However, when he could endure this no longer,
he went to the bishop for the purpose of consulting him, what
was to be done by him in the matter ; on which the bishop
enjoined him, in virtue of the obedience he owed him, to carry
the body with him to the land of Jerusalem, that so, expiating
his crimes, he might restore his soul to the abodes of heaven.
Accordingly, induced by a feeling of penitence, he proceeded
with the other pilgrims, carrying the dead man on his shoulders,
to the praise of the good and the terror of the wicked.

In the same year, Henry, emperor of the Romans, arrested
the nobles of Sicily, and threw some of them into prison,



406 ANNALS OF EOGER DE HOYEDEN. A.D. 1197.

while others he put to death, after inflicting upon them various
tortures. He also caused the eyes to be put out of Margarite,
the admiral, to whom he had given the dukedom of Durazzo,
and the principality of Tarento ; and after that had him emas-
culated. On this, the empress Constance, seeing the evils that
the emperor had inflicted upon her people, formed a conspiracy
against her husband the emperor, and, proceeding to Palermo,
seized the emperor's treasures which the kings of Sicily had
laid up from a distant period. In consequence of this, the
principal men of the kingdom, becoming emboldened, laid
hands on the German followers of the emperor, and slew them;
upon which, the emperor, taking to flight, shut himself up in
a strong fortress, intending, if he possibly could, to return to
his own country; but his adversaries had so obstructed the
paths against him, that in no direction was there safe egress
for him.

In the meantime, Saphadin, the brother of Saladin, after
the capture of Joppa, collecting a large army of pagans, fought
a battle with the chiefs before-mentioned, and the counts and
army of the emperor of the Eomans, which he had sent into
the land of Jerusalem ; and the army of the Christians prevailed,
and in the battle the Christians took the two sons of Saladin,
and more than sixty admirals, and Saphadin, the brother of
Saladin, being mortally wounded, made his escape with diffi-
culty. The Christians also took the city of Sidon, and Laliche,
and the greater Gybel ; and they were in hopes that the son of
Saladin, who held the city of Jerusalem, would become a
Christian, for news had been brought to that effect by the
messengers that carried the communications between them.

In the meantime, the pagans who were in the city of Earuth,
fearing an attack of the Christians, levelled the walls of the
city, and drew into the castle provisions, necessaries, and arms,
with the stones of the walls for the defence of the castle. One
day, however, while they were intent with the greatest dili-
gence upon this object, having left only five Christian captives,
in fetters, and a single Saracen gate-keeper in the castle, the
archbishop of Mentz, chancellor of the emperor of the Eomans,
suddenly came upon them with a great naval force, and Aimerie,
lord of the isle of Cyprus, and the before-named leaders and
chieftains, with an army of horse and foot. The Christians
who were in the castle, seeing this, ran as well as they could,
and, shutting the gates of the castle, slew the Saracen gate-

keeper, and then, ascending to the top of it, shouted with a loud
voice the war-cry of the Christians, " Christ, the Son of God,
aid us and his Holy sepulchre." Alarmed at the cry, the pagans
fled to the mountains, leaving the castle, the city, their pro-
visions, and their arms, on which the Christians were received
into the city and the castle with gladness.

After this, the said archbishop of Mentz, by the advice and
wish of the chief men of Germany, gave to Aimeric, lord of
Cyprus, Acre, and Tyre, and Baruth, 63 and the other cities
which they had taken ; and then gave him Milicent to wife,
who had been the wife of Henry, count of Champagne, and
crowned them in the city of Baruth ; on which Aimeric became
the liegeman of Henry, emperor of the Romans, for the isle of
Cyprus.

Of the Exile of John, Archbishop of Dublin.

In the same year, Hamo de Valence, and the other guardians
of Ireland, liegemen of earl John, brother of Eichard, king of
England, did great injuries to John Cumin, archbishop of
Dublin. Consequently, the said archbishop, preferring to go
into exile, rather than endure that these enormities against him
and his church should any longer go unpunished, excommu-
nicated the said presumptuous men, and, pronouncing sentence
of interdict upon his archbishopric, took his departure. He
also ordered the crosses and images of the cathedral church to
be laid on the ground, and to be surrounded with thorns, that
thus these malefactors might be smitten with fear, and be
checked in their intentions to rage against the property of the
church. But while they were still persevering in their malig-
nant purposes, a miracle happened, in our times quite unheard-
of.

There was, in the cathedral church of Dublin, a cross, on
which the figure of Christ was carved with great exactness ;
this, all the Irish, as well as others, held in the greatest vene-
ration. Now, while this crucifix was lying prostrate on the
ground, and surrounded with thorns, on the sixth day of the
week, it fell into an agony, and the face appeared to be suffused
with an exceeding red colour, just as though it were before a
heated furnace, and a violent sweat ran down from the face,
and from its eyes fell drops, as though it were weeping ; and
at the sixth hour of the day, blood and water came forth from
63 Now Beyrout.



408 ANXALS OF EOGEE DE HOVEDEX. A.D. 1197.

the right side, and the right breast. This the ministers of the
church carefully collected, and sent a deputation after John
Cumin, the archbishop, stating to him the happening of these cir-
cumstances, under testimony of the seals of venerable men, for
the purpose of being mentioned to our lord the pope.

But as for the rest of the bishops of Ireland, although they
had often read the proverb, " Your own property is at stake
when your neighbour's party wall is on fire," 64 still, shutting
their eyes thereto, they passed by the losses and injuries that
the above-named servants of John, earl of Mortaigne, had done
to their brother bishop, and, becoming as rams having no horns,
fled from before the face of the pursuer. However, John, the
archbishop of Dublin, going into exile, went to Richard king of
England, and John, earl of Mortaigne, his brother, but could
obtain no redress or restitution of what had been taken from him.

In the same year, Henry, emperor of the Romans, having
made a reconciliation with his wife, and the chief men of
Sicily, fell ill, and sent Savaric, bishop of Bath, his relative
and chancellor, from Burgundy, to Richard, king of England,
and offered to repay him the money he had exacted from him
for his ransom, either in gold and silver, or in lands. But while
the said Savaric was gone on this embassy, the before-named
emperor of the Romans died, at Messina, in Sicily, on the vigil
of Saint Michael, being excommunicated by pope Celestinus,
for his detention of Richard, king of England, and exacting
from him a ransom ; in consequence of which, the said pope
forbade his body to IDC buried, although the archbishop of Mes-
sina made great entreaties in his behalf.

Accordingly, the said archbishop waited on pope Celestinus,
for three reasons. In the first place, that the body of the em-
peror might receive burial ; in the second place, that Marcho-
wald, the chief justiciary of the emperor, might be liberated
from the siege by the people of Rome, who were then besieging
him in the marshes of Guarnero, not allowing him to depart ;
in the third place, that Frederic, son of the aforesaid emperor,
might be crowned king of Sicily. To the first of these prayers,
our lord the pope Celestinus made answer, that he would not
allow the body of the emperor to be buried, except with the
consent of the king of England, and unless the money which
he had received from the king of England, should be returned.

64 " En tua res agitur, paries cum proxhnus ardet/'



A.I}. 1197. CELESTINT7S OFFEKS TO DESIGN THE PAPACY. 409

To the second prayer, our lord the pope made answer, that he
could not liberate the said Marchowald of his own authority,
without the consent of the people of Home. To the third
prayer, our lord the pope made answer, that he would consent,
if it should please his brother cardinals, that Frederic, the son
of the before-named emperor, should be crowned king of Sicily ;
which coronation accordingly took place, a thousand marks of
silver having been given to our lord the pope on his own be-
half, and a thousand marks of silver in behalf of the cardinals.
The empress, also, made oath, touching the Holy Evangelists,
that the said Frederic was issue of the lawful marriage of the
said emperor Henry and herself.

In the same year, Koger, the brother of Eobert, earl of Lei-
cester, being elected bishop of Saint Andrew's, in Scotland, re-
ceived priest's orders and pontifical consecration from Matthew,
bishop of Aberdeen. In the same year, Margaret, formerly
queen of England and then queen of Hungary, died at Acre.

On the demise of Henry, emperor of the Romans, a great
part of Tuscany, which the said emperor and his predecessors
had taken from the Roman Pontiffs, was restored to our lord,
Celestinus, the Supreme Pontiff, namely, Aquapendente, Saint
Crispin, Monte Fiascone, Redecoces, and Saintclere, with all their
appurtenances ; there were also restored to him Sicily, Cala-
bria, Apulia, and all the territories which had belonged to the
king of Sicily, as being the proper patrimony of Saint Peter ,
over which, as above-mentioned, he made Frederic, son of
Henry, the Roman emperor, king.

Shortly after this, our lord the pope, Celestinus, gradually
sickened, just before the Nativity of our Lord, and having called
before him all the cardinals, recommended them to take mea-
sures for the election of his successor ; for he was using every
possible endeavour that the lord John de Saint Paul, cardinal
priest and titular of Saint Prisca the Virgin, might succeed
him in the papacy, in whose wisdom, sanctity, and justice,
he placed great confidence. Indeed, he so greatly loved him
beyond the rest, that he had appointed him in his own place
to perform every duty except the consecration of bishops, which
belonged to the duties of the cardinal bishop of Ostia.

The pope also made an offer to resign the papacy, if the car-
dinals would consent to the election of the said John de Saint
Paul. All the cardinals, however, with one voice, made an-
swer, that they would not elect him conditionally, and alleged



410 ANNALS OF EOGEE DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1197.

that it was a thing unheard-of for the Supreme Pontiff to ab-
dicate. Consequently, a division ensued among them ; for the
lord cardinal bishop of Ostia used every possible endeavour
that he might be elected pope, and, in like manner did the
lord cardinal bishop of Portuenza, the lord Jordan de Fossa
IsTova, the lord Gratianus, and all the rest, struggle, each to
the utmost of his power, that he might be made Supreme
Pontiff.

In the same year, William, king of the Scots, following a
good example, caused the subjects of his kingdom to make oath
that they would keep the peace to the best of their ability, and
that they would neither be thieves, nor robbers, nor outlaws,
nor harbourers of them, nor would in any way abet them ;
and that, whenever they might hear of any such offenders,
they would use the utmost of their ability in arresting and de-
stroying them.

An Assize of Measures made ly Richard, king of England.

" It is enacted, that all measures, throughout the whole of
England, shall be of the same capacity, both for corn and for
pulse, as also for other things of a like nature, that is to say, one
good and reasonable horseload ; 64 and this is to be the measure
established, both within cities and boroughs, and without.
The measure also of wine, ale, and all liquors, is to be of the
same size, according to the various natures of the liquors.
Weights also, and scales, and other measures of dimension, are
to be of the same quantity throughout all the kingdom, accord-
ing to the different nature of the commodities. Also, in the
measures of corn, and of liquors, such as wine and ale,
let pegs 65 of iron be driven into them, that false measure
may not fraudulently be given. It is also decreed, that
woollen cloths, wherever they are made, are to be made of the
same breadth, that is to say, two ells wide within the lists ; and
all are to be of the same goodness in the middle, and in the
sides. The ell is to be the same throughout the whole king-
dom, and of the same length, and is to be made of iron. It
is also forbidden to all traders throughout the whole king-
dom of England, that any trader shall hang up before his

shop, red or black cloths, or penthouses, or anything else, by
means of which the sight of the purchaser is often deceived in
choosing a good cloth. It is also forbidden, that any dye
shall be sold, or that any, except black alone, shall be made
anywhere in the kingdom, except in cities, or in county bo-
roughs. It is also enacted, that in eacji city or borough, four
or six lawful men of the said place, according to the size
thereof, together with the sheriff, or together with the chief
officer of the city or borough, if the same shall not be in
the hands of the sheriff, 66 shall be appointed to keep this
assize, in the following manner ; they are to see and be as-
sured that all things are sold and bought by the same
measure, and that all measures are of the same quantity, ac-
cording to the different nature of the wares. And if they
shall find any person who shall make confession, or be con-
victed of selling otherwise than by statute measure, let his
body be seized, and let him be committed to prison, and let
all his chattels be seized to the king's use ; and such persons
are not to be set at liberty, except by our lord the king, or his
chief justice.

"As to the guardians themselves, it was enacted, that it
they should exercise the said guardianship so negligently, that
they should be convicted by means of others than themselves,
before the justices of our lord the king, of transgressing any
one of the before-written statutes, either as to the measures of
provisions, or of other wares, or the width of cloth, the guar-
dians themselves should be amerced out of their own chattels
by our lord the king.

" It was also commanded, that after the feast of the Purifi-
cation of Saint Mary, no person should sell anything in any
county, except by the prescribed measure, which was to be of
the same quantity; and that no one should, after the fair which
is held at Mid-Lent, at Stamford, sell any cloth of less width
than two ells within the lists."

In the year of grace 1198, being the ninth year of the reign
of Eichard, king of England, the said Eichard, king of Eng-
land, was at Eouen, in Normandy, on the day of the Nativity
of our Lord, which fell on the fifth day of the week. On the
same day of the Nativity of our Lord, Hubert, archbishop of
Canterbury, primate of all England, legate of the Apostolic
See, and chief justiciary of all England, was at Hereford, in
Wales, and there received possession of the castle of Hereford,

the castle of Briges, 67 and the castle of Ludlow, having ex-
pelled therefrom the keepers, who had long held charge of
them, and gave them into the care of other keepers on behalf
of the king.

After this, the said archbishop came to Coventry, and by
the mandate of Celestinus, the Supreme Pontiff, reinstated the
monks in the cathedral church of that city, whom Hugh de
Eunant, the bishop of that place, had expelled from the said
church by violence and an armed hand, and had instituted in
their places canons secular, and endowed them with the pro-
perty of the church, which had been bestowed for the sus-
tenance of the monks there serving God ; but the canons being
now expelled, the property of the church was restored for the
use of the monks.

The Letters Apostolic for the reinstatement of the monks in the
church of Coventry.

" Celestinus, the bishop, servant of the servants of God, to
his dearly beloved sons the archbishop of Canterbury, the
bishop of Lincoln, and the abbat of Saint Edmund's, health
and the Apostolic benediction. Whereas it is our wish that
such provisions as have been made by enactment by our pre-
decessors with prudent deliberation, should in nowise be in-
validated or infringed, so also it is our desire that such things
as have been surreptitiously obtained from them to the detri-
ment of ecclesiastical propriety should be corrected, and brought
into a better state. Wherefore, inasmuch as, according as we
have heard, or rather indeed, as we well know, the monastic
order has been established in the church of Coventry, almost
from the time of the first introduction of the Christian faith into
England, and has performed therein with such well-regulated
observance all duties, that it has been deemed deserving to
receive privileges from the Apostolic See, and to be endowed
and enriched by kings of England of famous memory, we
are greatly afflicted that our venerable brother, the bishop
of Chester (on the pretext of certain letters, which, as it is said,
but we can hardly believe, he obtained by means of a false
suggestion from our predecessor pope Clement, of blessed
memory, without our concurrence, and that of our brethren),
has with violence expelled our dearly beloved sons, the prior
and community of monks, from the said monastery, and estab-
lished canons secular therein. Now, inasmuch as the same

may redound to the disgrace of the monastic order and the disci-
pline of the whole Church, and it is our belief that our said prede-
cessor wouldnot have granted his authority or favour to so great an
irregularity, unless he had been imposed upon, we do by these
Apostolic writings command your brotherhood, and do, in virtue
of your obedience, strictly enjoin you, the letters aforesaid or other
privileges of confirmation or indulgence in any way notwith-
standing, to remove the secular clergy from the said monastery
who have been instituted therein by the above-named bishop,
and, without being impeded by any question or doubt whatso-
ever, to reinstate therein the monastic order, installing therein
the monks who have been expelled, and who shall return thereto,
as also such persons as are bound and desire to observe the rules
of the order of Saint Benedict. You are also, by means of eccle-
siastical censure, all power of appeal removed, to compel the
aforesaid bishop, and all withholders of the property of the
said church, to make restitution of the same. "We do further
will and command, that, relying on our authority, you will
render null and void the presentations of the said bishop, as
also the enfeoffments, leases, alienations, and purchases made
by the said church since the time aforesaid, smiting those with
canonical censure who shall presume to contravene the same,
all obstacle of appeal removed ; and that those who have laid
violent hands upon the said monks you will denounce as excom-
municated ; and they must come for absolution to the Apostolic
See, furnished with the testimony of your letters. Given, &c."

At the Nativity of our Lord, there came to Rouen, envoys
from the archbishop of Cologne, envoys from the archbishop of
Mentz, and envoys from the other nobles of Germany, to wait
upon king Richard, and to inform him, on behalf of the persons
aforesaid, that all the nobles of Germany would meet at Cologne
on the eighth day before the calends of March, for the purpose
of electing an emperor; and they enjoined him, in virtue of the
oath and fealty by which he was bound to the emperor and to the
Roman empire, all denial and pretext whatsoever laid aside, to
come to Cologne at the time aforesaid, in order that he, as an
especial member of the empire, might be with them on the
occasion of their electing, by the help of God, a fit and proper
emperor for the empire.

After hearing them, Richard, king of England, having fisrt
conferred with his people, sent, with the aforesaid envoys
of the Germans, Philip, bishop of Durham, Eustace, the
bishop elect of Ely, William de Chimeli, the bishop elect of



414 ANNALS OF ROGER DE HOVEDEN. A. D. 1193.

Anjou, the bishop elect of Evreux, as also Baldwin de Bethune,
the earl of Aumarle, "William de Pratelles, William de L'Estang,
and Brice, his chamberlain, that they might be present at the
election of emperor in his stead. For he greatly feared to go
thither, and once more to fall into their hands, unless security
should be given him for a safe conduct going and returning.
And no wonder, for he had not yet paid what he had promised
to give to the nobles of the land for his liberation, and for his
sake it was that the body of the emperor was lying unburied.

The king of England, however, used every possible endea-
vour that Henry, duke of Saxony, his nephew, might be made
emperor. But as he had not yet returned from his pilgrimage,
and delay brought danger with it, the said king of England
wrought so effectually with the archbishops of Cologne and
Mentz, and some of the other principal men of Germany, that
they elected his nephew Otho, brother of the before-named duke
of Saxony, emperor. It deserves to be known, that in the
election of the emperor of the Romans, the mode of procedure
is as follows :

The manner of electing the Emperor of the Romans.

On the death of the emperor, the archbishops, bishops, abbats,
dukes, counts, and all the other nobles of Germany, meeting
together, elect twelve persons in common, "and present them
to the archbishop of Cologne, the archbishop of Mentz, the
duke of Saxony, and the Count Palatine of the Rhine ; and
whosoever these four elect from the twelve so selected as afore-
said, is to be the king of the Germans, and to be crowned as
such at the Chapel of Hays, 68 where Charles the Great lies
buried.

Accordingly, the before-named Otho, being one of the twelve
persons so selected in common, as aforesaid, on the urgent
prayers and intercession made by Richard, king of England,
[on his election,] was received by the archbishops of Cologne
and Mentz, and was crowned by them king of the Germans,
at Aix-la-Chapelle, in presence of the dukes of Lemburg,
Louvaine, and many other dukes and many bishops, Baldwin,
earl of Flanders, being also present, and Henry, count of Namur,
his brother, and many other counts. On this, the said Otho
took to wife the daughter of the duke of Louvaine, and on the
day of the coronation of the said Otho, she sat together with him
on the royal throne, but was not crowned at that time.
68 Aix-la-Chapelle.



A.D. 1198. THE BISHOP OF LINCOLN OPPOSES THE KING. 415

Henry, duke of Saxony, also Count Palatine of the Ehine,
the brother of the before-named Otho, after his return from
the land of Sulia, sanctioning what had been done with refe-
rence to his brother, and expressing his gratification thereat,
confirmed his election. But, as Philip, duke of Suabia, son of
Frederic, the former emperor of the Romans, and brother of
Henry, emperor of the Romans, lately deceased, was one of
the twelve selected, he would not agree to his election, but
attacked Otho in every way he possibly could ; and although
Otho defeated him in a pitched battle, he still refused to desist
from his attempts.

In the same year, Aimeric, archdeacon of Durham, dis-
seised the monks of the church of Durham of the vill which is
called Hersewell, which Henry Pudsey had given them as a
free and perpetual alms-gift, for the maintenance of monks at
Finchale, for the service of God. His servants, who had
been sent for the purpose of making the said disseisin, broke
open the doors of the monks' dwellings, and, with violence,
ejected the monks they found there. When, however, the said
Aimeric was asked if this violence had been committed by his
orders, he answered, "No:" on which, the monks of Durham,
having convened the clergy and people of the city in the church
of Saint Cuthbert, excommunicated the perpetrators of this
violence, as also their advisers and abettors, with candles lighted
and the great bells of the church ringing.

In the same year, Eichard, king of England, through Hubert,
archbishop of Canterbury, required that the people of the king-
dom of England should find for him three hundred knights to re-
main in his service one year, or else give him so much money as
to enable him therewith to retain in his service three hundred
knights for one year, namely, three shillings per day, English
money, as the livery of each knight. "While all the rest were
ready to comply with this, not daring to oppose the king's
wishes, Hugh, bishop of Lincoln, a true worshipper of God, who
withheld himself from every evil work, made answer, that, for
his part, he would never in this one matter acquiesce in the
king's desires, both because, in process of time, it would re-
dound to the detriment of his church, as also, because his suc-
cessors would say : " Our fathers have eaten sour grapes, and
the children's teeth are set on edge." 69 And, turning to Hubert,
archbishop of Canterbury, he urgently recommended him to
69 Jer. xxxi. 29; Ezek. xviii. 2.

do nothing of which he would be ashamed, " By reason
whereof shame might place a mark on his forehead, and self-
accusation torture his mind, or disgrace blemish the glories of
his fair name." 70

In the same year, queen Eleanor, the mother of Richard,
king of England, came to Rouen, and sent for Hugh Fitz-
Ernest de Neville and the other keepers who had charge of
Philip, bishop of Beauvais, in the fortress of Rouen, and begged
them, for the love they bore her, to allow the said bishop to
come to her lodging to speak to her : and, although it was a
perilous matter for them, still, being unable to resist the
queen's entreaty, they allowed the said bishop, in fetters, to go
beyond the gates of the fortress, while they accompanied him.
Now, it so happened that they had to pass by the porch of a
certain church ; to the door of which, although it was closed,
the said bishop ran as fast as he could, and, seizing the knocker
of the said church, cried with a loud voice, saying, " I seek
the protection of God and of the Church." At these words, his
guards, being greatly alarmed, laid hands on him, and, dragging
him away from the door of the church, led him to the fortress
whence he had come, and kept him in still stricter custody, im-
puting it to the queen that this had been done by her advice.
On hearing of this, the king of England sent the said bishop
to Chinon, to be kept in closer confinement.

In the same year, Hubert, archbishop of Canterbury, conse-
crated Eustace, bishop of Ely, at London, on the Lord's Day
on which is sung " Lcetare Jerusalem " 7i the ceremony being
performed at Westminster, on the eighth day before the ides
of March.

In the same year, pope Celestinus, sinking "ider the weight
of old age and a grievous malady, departed this life, at Rome,
in the month of January, on the sixth day before the ides of
the said month, being the sixth day of the week, in the seventh
year of his papacy, and was buried at the Lateran. On the
day after his death, the cardinals, meeting together, elected
as Supreme Pontiff Lothaire, a cardinal deacon, a young man,
about thirty years old or a little more, who assumed the name
of pope Innocent. Immediately after his election, he wrote

A.D. 1198. LETTEK OF POPE INNOCENT. 417

to all the archbishops and bishops of England and Scotland to
the following effect :

The Letter of pope Innocent, on the occasion of his Election.

<( Innocent, bishop elect of the Apostolic See, servant of
the servants of God, to all his venerable brethren, the arch-
bishops and bishops throughout England appointed, health and
the Apostolic benediction. The ineffable wisdom of the Deity
hath so, in His exalted counsels, disposed all things from ever-
lasting, and, by His wondrous dispensation, so rules them
through the vicissitudes of ages as they roll on, that there
occurs neither error in the order thereof, nor defect in the work-
manship ; inasmuch as, Holy Scripture testifying the same, He
has made every thing by weight, by number, and by measure.
Wherefore, although he ordains nothing upon earth without a
certain cause, and appropriate reason for the same, still, the
imperfect state of human nature, not only fails in investigating
the causes of His works, but, even in viewing the results them-
selves of those causes, can hardly be sufficiently astounded [at
the marvellousness thereof] ; indeed, it was while considering
this, that the Apostle exclaimed, ' the depth of the riches
both of the wisdom and knowledge of God ! How unsearchable
are His judgments, and His ways past finding out!' 72 For,
although, the prophet bearing testimony thereto, ' All the ways
of the Lord are mercy and truth,' 73 and 'All His works are
done in truth,' 7 * still, to such a degree does the right hand of
the Lord, great though it is, work out the successes of man-
kind, both their humiliation and their exaltation, that it is a
cause to ourselves of no slight astonishment that, in the bestowal
of power, He sometimes placefc the younger before the elder
ones, and, as the prophet says, ' Sons are born in place of the
fathers,' who, being appointed to govern all the earth, are to
remember the name of the Lord. And so in our case, ' This
is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes.' 75 For
Celestinus, of blessed memory, our father and predecessor,
having gone the way of all flesh, on the sixth day before the
ides of January, and having been honorably interred, according
to custom, in the church of the Lateran, our brethren, that is
to say, the cardinal bishops, priests, and deacons, and ourselves
with them, met together, that with the more freedom and safety,

we might discuss the election of a pontiff, thus great being the
necessity for holding the said discussion with all due delibe-
ration, and coming to a conclusion after using the most guarded
circumspection in so doing. Accordingly, after the solemn
service of the mass had been performed in honor of the Holy
Ghost, the wishes of all directed their views upon ourselves,
insufficient as we are, perhaps thinking, in their human sagacity,
to find the silver cup in the sack of Benjamin ; although many
of them might, on the grounds of age, rank, and merit, have
been more worthily called to the elevation of a dignity so ex-
alted. And, although our sense of our inefficiency utterly
recoiled from the weight of a dignity so great, as being a burden
unsuited to the weakness of our shoulders, still, confiding in the
example of Him, who strengthened the weakness of Saint Peter,
which had been previously tested by his three denials, after the
words of his thrice-reiterated confession, by bestowing on him
the guidance of His sheep ; that which the manifold imper-
fections of our nature declined, we accepted at their desire, lest
our opposition thereto might produce injury, by reason of pro-
longed divisions, or we might seem, in a measure, to be struggling
against the ordinance of God, hoping that He who giveth to all
abundantly and grudgeth not, and who raised the youngest
son, 76 the man after His own heart, to be king, will raise up
from the stones a son to Abraham, calling the things which are
not, even as the things which are, and that by raising up the
weak, He will put the strong to confusion. "Wherefore, we,
undertaking the onerous duties of the government of the church,
and placing no small confidence in you, whom the Lord hath
willed to be partakers in our cares, to the end that the weight
of a burden so great may press the more lightly upon US', do
ask, advise, and exhort the whole of you, in the Lord, to aid
our inefficiency with your prayers unto the Lord, and, diligently
and profitably watching over the flock of the Lord that has
been entrusted to us and to you, to show yourselves ready to
make up for our defects, and with watchful zeal to aid in sup-
porting the weight of the ecclesiastical dignity which has been
conferred upon us. And further, it is our earnest intention to
show to you all honor as being distinguished members of the
church, and, so far as the Lord shall aid us in so doing, to assist
you in your emergencies. Given at the Lateran, on the fifth
day before the ides of January."

A.D.1198. THE DEAN AND CANONS OP YOEK COME TO THE KING. 419



I Accordingly, upon the election of the said Innocent as Roman
Pontiff, having been from his infancy acquainted with all the
blemishes of the Roman court, and wishing to change things
for the better, immediately after his election he dismissed the
greater part of the janitors and doorkeepers of the court, in
order that both clerks as well as laymen, who had any com-
plaint to make, might enjoy freer access to him.

On the fifth day before the ides of March, in the same year,
Mary, countess of Champagne, departed this life, the mother
of Henry, count of Champagne, who was lord of Acre. The
said countess was sister of Philip, king of France, on the
father's side, and sister of Richard, king of England, on the
mother's side.

In the same year, Geoffrey, archbishop of York, came into
Normandy by command of his brother, Richard, king of Eng-
land, in hopes of making peace with the king. For the king-
had sent for the deans and canons of York to come to him in
Normandy, wishing to make peace between the archbishop and
them ; however, the archbishop, before the canons had arrived,
had made a reconciliation with the king his brother; upon which
the king made him full restitution of his archbishopric, and
ordered Robert his chaplain to cross over into England with
Master Honorius, the clerk and deputy of the said archbishop,
to be present at the said restitution, on which the said arch-
bishop conferred on the said Master Honorius the archdeaconry
of Richmond ; for the king had made a promise to the arch-
bishop that for the future he would not throw any difficulty
in the way of his presentations. As the dean and canons of
York did not make their appearance before the king at the
time appointed, nor yet send a sufficient proxy in their behalf,
the archbishop, having received leave from the king, withdrew
from the court, for the purpose of going to Rome on the king's
business as well as his own.

However, on the third day after, the deans and canons of
York came to the king, and prevailed upon him to allow the
restitution which he had granted to the archbishop to be de-
layed until the archbishop's return; and, having thus impeded
the business of the archbishop, the dean and canons returned to
York, making great boasts of the favours they had received from
the king, and saying that they had the king's charter that he
would not come to any complete understanding with the arch-
bishop unless they were included in the reconciliation.

In the same year, on the first Sunday in Lent, Innocent; the
bishop elect of the Eoman See, was consecrated Eoman Pontiff
at Saint Peter's at Rome, by Octavianus, bishop of Ostia, on the
fifteenth day before the calends of March, and, immediately
after his consecration, the prefect, senators, and tribunes of
the city, and others of the Eoraan people, demanded of him
the revenues and customs which the Eoman Pontiffs, his pre-
decessors, had been in the habit of paying them ; to which he
made answer that he would never do so, inasmuch as if he
should do so. he would be doing it against the will of God, and to
the prejudice of the Church of Eome. The Eomans, upon hear-
ing this, made an attack upon his possessions, and plundered
them, on which he excommunicated them.

In the month of March, in the same year, Hugh de Nunant,
bishop of Coventry, died at Betherlevin, in Normandy, on Good
Friday, being the sixth day before the calends of April, and
was buried there in the convent of the monks, being succeeded
in the bishopric of Coventry by Geoffrey de Muschamp, arch-
deacon of Cleveland, w r ho was presented thereto by Eichard,
king of England, and consecrated at Canterbury by Hubert,
archbishop of Canterbury.

In the same year, the king of England with the earl of Saint
Gilles, and Joanna his wife, the former queen of Sicily, were at
Le Mans, at the festival of Easter, which fell on the fourth day
before the calends of April. In the same year, Eichard, king
of England, levied from each carucate or hide of land through-
out all England five shillings as an aid ; for the purpose of collect-
ing which, the said king sent through each county of England
one clerk and one knight ; who, with the sheriff of the county
to which they were sent, and lawful knights elected for the
purpose, making oath that they would faithfully perform the
king's business, caused to appear before them the seneschals
of the barons of the said county, and the lord or bailiff of every
vill, and the reeve, together with the four lawful men of the
vill, whether freemen or villeins, as also two lawful knights
of the hundred, who made oath that they would faithfully and
without fraud declare what was the amount of carucates in
each vill that were in tillage ; namely, how many were held in
demesne, how many in villanage, and how many in almoign be-
stowed on religious orders, which the givers thereof were bound
to make warranty of, or to pay for, or for which the said re-

ligious were bound to do service ; and upon each carucate in
tillage, by the king's commands, they first levied two shillings
and then three shillings ; all of which was reduced to writing.
Of all this the clerk had one register, the knight another, the
sheriff a third, and the seneschals of the barons a fourth regis-
ter as to the land of their lords.

This money was received by the hands of two lawful knights
of each hundred, and by the hands of theJbailiff of the hundred,
and they were answerable for the same to the sheriff, and the
sheriff answerable for the same according to the before-men-
tioned registers to the exchequer, in presence of the bishops,
abbats, and barons appointed for the purpose.

Also, for the punishment of the jurors who, contrary to their
oath, should be guilty of concealing anything in the said
matters, it was enacted that whatever villein should be con-
victed of perjury he should forfeit to his lord the best ox of his
plough, and should, out of his own property, be answerable
for as much money for the use of our lord the king as should
be proved to have remained concealed by means of his perjury ;
but if a free man should be convicted, he was to be amerced by
the king, and was to refund as well out of his own property as
much as had been concealed by him, in the same manner as the
villein.

It was also enacted, that every baron should, with the aid
of the sheriff, make levies upon his tenants ; and, if by default
of the baron, such levies should not be made, then there was
to be taken from the demesne of the baron, what should re-
main payable by his tenants, and the baron was to take the
same from his tenants. Frank-fees of parish churches were ex-
empted from the said tallage; and all escheats of barons which
were held in the lands of our lord the king contributed thereto.
But serjeanties 78 of our lord the king, which were not attached
to knights' fees, were excepted, although they were placed
on the register, as also the number of the carucates of land,
the values of their lands, and the names of those holding by ser-
jeanty ; and all' those so holding, were summoned to be at
London on the octave at the end of Easter, to hear and per-
form the king's commands.

pointed by our lord the king, according to the estimation of

lawful men, set down a hundred acres of land for each caru-
cate of land in cultivation. 79

In the same year, the monks of the Holy Trinity at Canter-
bury, setting out for Home, made complaint to pope Innocent,
that Hubert, archbishop of Canterbury, contrary to his orders
and his dignity, was acting as justiciary of the kingdom, and
as judge in matters of life and death, and was so involved in
secular matters, that he could not possibly give attention to
the management of the affairs of the church ; it being wisely
said, that " When the sense is intent on many objects, it is
less intent on each." 80 They also laid charges against him,
saying, that it was by his command that the peace of the church
of Saint Mary at Arches, at London, had been violated, and
"William Longbeard had been violently dragged therefrom,
and tied to horses' tails, and dragged away to the gibbet, to-
gether with nine of his associates similarly torn away from
that church, and then hanged on the gallows. On this, our lord
the pope, with a fatherly exhortation, recommended Eichard,
king of England, as he valued the safety of his soul, not to
allow the said archbishop any longer to discharge secular
duties, and in future not to admit him or any other bishop or
priest to a secular office ; he also ordered all the prelates of
churches, in virtue of their obedience, not with rash presump-
tion to undertake the discharge of secular duties. Accord-
ingly, the archbishop of Canterbury being removed from the
management of the kingdom, Geoffrey Fitz-Peter succeeded
him in the same.

They also accused him, alleging that, to the prejudice of the
mother church of Canterbury, he had built a new church at
Lambeth, and had placed therein canons secular, endowed
with the property and benefices of the monks of Canterbury,
and had therein, against the custom and dignity of the church
of Canterbury, consecrated bishops ; and that, unless a remedy
was speedily put thereto, they feared that the dignity of the
church of Canterbury might be diminished, and might appear
to be transferred to this apostate chapel. Our lord the pope,
being considerably influenced by this, wrote to Hubert, arch-
bishop of Canterbury to the following effect :

79 Or more literally, as our law books express it, for the " gainage of

A. D. 1198. LETTER OF POPE INNOCENT. 423

The Letter of pope Innocent to Hubert, archbishop of Canter-
bury, ordering the demolition of the chapel at Lambeth.

" Innocent the bishop, servant of the servants of God, to
his dearly beloved brother, Hubert, archbishop of Canterbury,
health and the Apostolic benediction. The more sincere the
affection with which we love your person, the greater the
grief with which we are afflicted, so often as we hear of actions
of yours which are derogatory to pontifical propriety. For,
whereas the church of Canterbury, over which you are known
to preside, is considered among the churches of England to
hold the foremost rank, and in religion has been accustomed
to stand pre-eminent among the rest, we and our brethren are
both afflicted and amazed that (as our dearly beloved sons, the
prior and convent, have with humble complaint showed unto
us,) you occupy yourself in manifold ways, and exert your
utmost endeavours in the building of the chapel at Lambeth,
contrary to the prohibition of Urban and Clement, the Eoman
Pontiffs, of blessed memory, which were issued against your
predecessor Baldwin, relative thereto. After multiplied appeals
to the Apostolic See, to the great prejudice of the church of
Canterbury, you have still in your rashness proceeded therein,
and have installed canons in the same, endowed with the pro-
perty of the said church, whereas, better consulting yourself
and your honor, you would have entirely desisted from the
building of the said chapel, if you had been ready to shew that
respect and obedience which you owe to the Church of Eome,
and would have sought to make provision and shew all anxiety
for the church committed to your charge, and would not have
made it your study to proceed in that which you know to have
been so strictly forbidden to your predecessor by the Apostolic
See. Wherefore, inasmuch as we ought not nor will we on
any account put up with the lessening of the church of Canter-
bury, walking in the footsteps of our aforesaid predecessors, by
the advice of our brethren, we do, by these Apostolic writings,
command your brotherhood and strictly enjoin you, all delay
and excuses laid aside, that if you should be absent from
your church, anything whatever notwithstanding, whatever is
known to have been done in the building of the aforesaid
chapel, after the appeals made both in the time of your pre-
decessors as also in your own to the Apostolic See, as also
the prohibitions thereof by our predecessors, you will, within



424 ANNALS OF ROGER DE HOVEDE1T. A.D. 1198.

thirty days after the receipt of these presents, not delay to
destroy at your own expense, utterly revoking as null and
void, and undoing whatever has been done, or whatever inno-
vation has been made, contrary to all rule, as to the instalment
of canons and other persons in the said chapel. The clergy
also, who, after the Apostolic prohibitions, have performed
Divine service in the said chapel, you are to hold suspended
from their duties and benefices until such time as they shall
have made due satisfaction for the same, all the works being
destroyed which they have dared to erect at the said chapel.
All matters of grievance also, 81 which, after appeal made by
them, they have been subjected to, by the intrusion of strangers,
and by the invasion of their churches and other rights, you are
to replace, all power of appeal removed, in their former state
in which they were before the appeal was made ; the sentences
also of excommunication or interdict which you are said in
your rashness to have pronounced upon some of the brethren
themselves, you are publicly to announce as null and void.
And for the future, as regards the state of the said monastery,
you are not on any pretext relative to this matter to presume,
contrary to our prohibition, to make any innovation therein,
but are, by the ban of excommunication, to compel the unlaw-
ful invaders of the vills, possessions, and revenues of the
brethren aforesaid, to make due and proper satisfaction for the
same. But if (a thing that we do not believe) you shall ne-
glect or delay, within the stated time, to fulfil our commands,
because it is just that obedience should be withdrawn from him
who neglects to pay obedience to the Apostolic See, we do, by
these our writings, command our venerable brethren, your suf-
fragans, thenceforth not to pay obedience or respect to you.
And if it shall so be, that, contrary to this our prohibition,
you shall exact obedience and respect to be shewn to you by
them, or any of them, you are to know that you are thence-
forth suspended from the episcopal dignity, and that you will
be subject to the said sentence, until such time as you shall
present yourself in our presence to make satisfaction for the
said contempt. And further, we do not make any distinction
as to whether, in the place forbidden by our predecessors or in
any other place, you shall proceed to act to the prej udice of the
church of Canterbury, by the building of the said chapel, and

81 This passage will not admit of an exact translation, as it is evidently
in a corrupt state.

the institution of canons therein, the same cause for forbidding
it still existing ; except that we are of opinion that it is still
more derogatory to the said church, that the building has been
transferred to a place so distant. 82 Given at Saint Peter's,
at Borne, on the eighth day before the ides of May, in the first
year of our pontificate."

The said pope Innocent also signified, by his letters to all the
suffragans of the church of Canterbury, that he had given com-
mands to Hubert, archbishop of Canterbury, not to delay,
within thirty days after the receipt of his letter, at his own
expense, to destroy the chapel of Lambeth, and revoke as null
and void whatever had been done as to the institution of canons
and other persons in reference to the said chapel, as also the
other matters that were contained in his said letter. He also
commanded the said suffragans that, if the said archbishop
of Canterbury should delay to do any of the things that were
contained in his said letter, then, in such case, for the future,
they were to pay him no respect or obedience.

However, the said archbishop, being supported by the king's
protection, hoping that he could not be defeated by his adver-
saries, caused all the revenues of the monks, and the offerings at
the tomb of the blessed Martyr Thomas, to be seized on the
king's behalf, and, disregarding the mandates of the Supreme
Pontiff, would not allow the monks of the Holy Trinity to go
beyond the precincts of that church. At last, however, at his
own expense, he destroyed the chapel at Lambeth.

In the same year, Geoffrey, the archbishop of York, and
Simon, the dean, together with the canons of York, appearing
in the presence of Eichard, king of England, at Andely, in
Normandy, each of them alleged the injuries done to the
one side and the other ; and, as it was in accordance with
the king's wishes that the said archbishop, dean, and canons of
York should submit to the arbitration of the lord archbishop
of Rouen, and the lords bishop of Winchester and Worcester,
the said archbishop consented to the king's desire on the sub-
ject : but the dean and canons of York made answer, that they
would not submit to the judgment of any person, except the
judgment of canons secular, and they alleged injustice on the
part of the king, because this mode of reconciliation was pro-
ductive of long delays, and, in the meantime, the archbishop

win from Akingtou, or Hackington, near Canterbury, to Lambeth.



426 ANNALS OF EOGEE DE HOVEDEX. A.D. 1198.

would not confirm the presentations which the king had made
to them in the church of York.

The king, being incensed at this conduct, gave the arch-
deaconry of Richmond to Roger of Saint Edmund's, his clerk,
which the archbishop of York had previously given to Master
Honorius, his clerk ; who, although he had received the fealty
of the clergy of the said archdeaconry by command of the
archbishop, and the archbishop had, by his letters, generally
given a command to the like effect to the whole chapter of
York, ordering them, in virtue of their obedience, to receive
the said Honorius and instal him, had still been rejected,
Simon of Apulia opposing him on the ground that the arch-
bishop had not made especial mention of him in his letters as
being dean of the said church. And accordingly, the afore-
said dean, a disturber of the peace, and unmindful of the pro-
fession which he had made to the said archbishop, received Roger
of Saint Edmund's, and installed him, and invested him with
the archdeaconry of Richmond, after appeal made by Master
Honorius to the Supreme Pontiff. On this, the clerks of the
archdeaconry of Richmond, through the violent coercion of
Simon of Apulia, and the stern commands of the king, paid
fealty to Roger of Saint Edmund's, in contravention of the
canonical obedience which they had previously paid to Master
Honorius. In the chapter of York, consisting of the said
Simon, the dean, and the other canons of the said church, the
aforesaid dean, in the violence of his wrath, paying no defer-
ence to the appeal made to the Supreme Pontiff, excommuni-
cated Hugh Murdac, his fellow-canon, because he refused to
sanction their proceedings, or take any part whatever in the
conspiracy formed against his archbishop. For, as he said :
"The wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood." 82 On the
same day, when the said Hugh entered the choir to attend
vespers, the dean ordered him to go out, as a person excommu-
nicated ; and, as he refused to depart, the dean ordered the tapers
to be put out, and left the choir.

In the same year, Geoffrey Fitz-Peter, the justiciary of Eng-
land, assembling a large army, proceeded to Wales, to succour
the people of William de Braose, whom Wenhunwin, 83 the
brother of Cadwallan, had besieged in Maud's Castle, and on
arriving there, he fought a pitched battle with the said Wen-
hunwin and his people, and, although the Welch in arms were

very numerous, still, not being able to make resistance to the
forces of the English, they were put to flight, and throwing
away their arms, that, being less burdened, they might run more
swiftly, there were slain more than three thousand seven hun-
dred of them, besides those who were captured, and those who
being fatally wounded escaped from the field ; while on the
side of the English, only one person was killed, being acciden-
tally wounded by an arrow incautiously aimed by one of his
companions.

In the same year, in the month of August, Ermengard, the
queen of the Scots, was delivered of her first-born son, and his
name was called Alexander, he being baptized by Jocelyn, the-
venerable bishop of Glasgow.

In the same year, the truce being ended, which the king of
France and the king of England had agreed to, until such time
as the corn should have been gathered in on both sides, their
direful fury immediately blazed forth, and, all conferences being
put an end to, each entered the kingdom of the other in hostile
form, and, depopulating the lands, carried off booty, took pri-
soners, and burned towns. The king of France also, rinding a
new method of venting his rage against the people, caused the
eyes to be put out of many of the subjects of the king of Eng-
land whom he had made prisoners, and thus provoked the king
of England, unwilling as he was, to similar acts of impiety.

In the same year, the Duke of Louvaine, the count de Brene,
Baldwin, earl of Flanders, the count de Gynes, the earl of
Boulogne, Geoffrey, count de Perche, the earl of Saint Gilles,
the earl of Blois, Arthur, duke of Brittany, and many others,
forsaking the king of France, became adherents of Richard,
king of England, making oath to him, and he to them, that
they would not make peace with the king of France, unless
with the common consent of all. On this, the earl of Flanders
laid siege to the town of Saint Omer, and took it by storm,
and in like manner Arras, and many other towns of the king
of France.

In the same year, Henry, duke of Saxony, nephew of Kichard,
king of England, came to Andely, in Normandy, to visit his
uncle, the said king of England, being on his return from the land
of Sulia ; and was honorably entertained by the king, in such
manner as befitted a man of such eminence, and his own nephew.
In the month of September, in the said year, Philip, king of
France, and llichard, king of England, had an engagement



428 ANNALS OF ROGER DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1198.

between Jumieges, a castle of the king of England, and Vernon,
a castle of the king of France, in which combat the king of
France and his people being put to flight, he lost sixty 64 of his
knights, and more than forty 85 men-at-arms, besides many
horse and foot ; the king of England pursuing the king of
France with the edge of the sword, until he shut himself up in
his castle of Vernon.

In the same year, Philip, bishop of Durham, received, by
command of king Richard, the manor of Sedbergh, with the
wapentake and knights' fees, and all other things thereto per-
taining, as fully and wholly as the charter of the said king
witnessed that the same grant was made to Hugh, bishop
of Durham. The king also gave him permission to enclose
with a ditch and hedge the wood of Cliff and the wood of
Raic, and quitted claim to him of view of forest as to them
both, and of all molestation on part of his foresters.

In the month of September in this year, on the fifth day
before the calends of October, being the Lord's day, Richard,
king of England, took by assault a castle of the king of France,
which is called Curcelles, and another castle of the same king
called Burris ; and, on the day after the capture of the said
castles, namely, on the calends of October, being the second
day of the week and the vigil of Saint Michael, Philip, king
of France, having assembled a large body of troops and citi-
zens, marched forth from Mante on his road to Curcelles. On
hearing of this, the king of England went forth to meet him,
and fought a pitched battle with him between Curcelles and
Gisors, on which the king of France, being worsted, fled to
the castle of Gisors ; and, while he was crossing the bridge
of the town of Gisors, the bridge broke down on account
of the multitude of those crossing it, and the king of France
fell into the river Ethe, and had to drink of it, and, if he had
not been speedily dragged out, would have been drowned
therein. In this battle, Richard, king of England, laid three
knights prostrate with a single lance, and there were taken
prisoners many illustrious men among the knights of the king
of France, whose names are as follows : Galis de Port, Mat-
thew de Montmorenci, Alan de . Rusci, Gerard de Choir, Philip
de Nanteuil, Peter L'Eschars, Robert de Saint Denis, Theobald
de Walengard, Cedunal de Trie, Roger de Modlen, Aimer
Thiers, Reginald d'Ascy, Balde de Levigny, Thomas d'Asgent,

Theobald de Misci: And, besides the knights already men-
tioned, the king of England took one hundred knights, and
one hundred and forty horses, covered with iron armour, and
of men-at-arms, both horse and foot, a great number.

On this occasion the said king wrote to Philip, bishop of
Durham, to the following effect :

The Letter of Richard, Icing of England, to Philip, lishop of
Durham, relative to the above-mentioned victory.

" Richard, Ky the grace of God, king of England, duke
of Normandy and Aquitaine, and earl of Anjou, to his dearly
beloved and faithful subject, Philip, by the same grace, bishop
of Durham, greeting. You are to know that on the last
Lord's day, before the feast of Saint Michael, we entered the
territory of the king of France, in Anjou, and made an assault
on Curcelles, of which we took the castle, with the town, as
also the lord of the castle, and all the rest who were therein.
On the same day we assaulted the fortified mansion of Bur-
ris, and took the whole that was in it, together with the
mansion, and at a late hour returned with our army into Anjou.
On hearing of this, on the following day the king of France
came forth from Mante, with three hundred knights, and with
men-at-arms and citizens, for the purpose of succouring the
castle of Curcelles, as he did not believe that it was taken.
On this, as soon as we learned that he was approaching, we
went forth with a small number of troops, but sent the main
body of our forces to line the bank of the river Ethe, as we
supposed that he would come upon our people on the opposite
bank of the river from the side of Anjou. He, however,
with his forces made a descent in the direction of Gisors, on
which, we put him and his people, after taking to flight, into
such consternation on their way to the gate of Gisors, that the
bridge broke down beneath them, and the king of France, as



430 ' ANNALS OF ROGER DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1198.

we have heard say, had to drink of the river, and several
knights, about twenty in number, were drowned. Three also,
with a single lance, we unhorsed, Matthew de Montmorency,
Alan de Rusci, and Fulk de Gilerval, and have them as our
prisoners. There were also valiantly captured as many as one
hundred knights of his, the names of the principal of whom we
send to you, and will send those of the rest, when we shall have
seen them, as Marchades has taken as many as thirty whom
we have not seen. Men at arms, also, both horse and foot,
were taken, of which the number is not known ; also, two
hundred chargers were captured, of which one hundred and
forty were covered with iron armour. Thus have we defeated
the king of France at Gisors ; but it is not we who have done
the same, but rather God, and our right, by our means ; and in
so doing, we have put our life in peril, and our kingdom, contrary
to the advice of all our people. These things we signify unto
you, that you may share in our joy as to the same. "Witness
ourselves, at Anjou."

On the thirtieth day of September, Philip, king of France,
entered Normandy, with a large army, while the king of Eng-
land had not with him sixty men, as he had scattered his
army over different places. However, he hung upon the rear
of the Franks, with a few of his troops, until there had met
him, in obedience to his command, about two hundred knights
and Marchades with his Eoutiers. Accordingly, the Franks,
although they were many more in number, on seeing the king
of England and his men, after having burned about eighteen
towns,retreated with hasty steps; and while the king of England
pursued them in the rear, Marchades, with his lloutiers, met
them in front, and there were taken of the French, about
thirty knights and men-at-arms, and one hundred horses, in
addition to those slain. This took place near Vernon ; for
they did not return by the road bj r which they had come, that
is, across the fords of Anjou, but, in their trepidation took to
flight in the direction of Vernon ; and it is still spoken of, as
a matter of disgrace to the French people, that, leaving his
men, their king made his escape on an old dark brown horse,
which they say he had had lor ten years, and took nothing
with him out of Normandy, except, perhaps, three or four
knights and a single man-at-arms.

After this, the king of England, collecting an army, entered
France by the ford of Anjou, and took, as above- stated, Burr is

and Curcelles, and another castle, while his troops, with con-
tinued ravages and conflagrations, laid waste the whole of the
French Yexin. When the king of England was on the point
of levelling the fortress of Curcelles, the king of France, col-
lecting his forces, came down upon him, and an engagement
taking place between them, the king of France, giving rein to
his horse, was put to flight in the midst of his territory, on
which the king of England pursued him with his troops, and
took of the knights of the king of France at least eighty-three
in number, besides men-at-arms, arbalisters, and those who
were drowned in the river Ethe ; and in consequence of the
excessive trepidation of the Franks, the bridge over the Ethe,
before Gisors, broke down beneath them, and the king of
France fell into the water, so that he was with difficulty dragged
out 86 by the leg, and was nearly drowned. A great many
others were also drowned, among whom were Milo de Pudsey,
count de Bar, and John, the brother of William des Barres, a
knight ; who with many others were drowned in the river Ethe.
William, also, the castellane and lord of Curcelles, died imme-
diately after he was taken prisoner.

After this, the king of France assembling an army, entered
Normandy, and burned Evreux and seven other towns. Earl
John also, brother of king Richard, burned Neuburg, which
the king of France thinking to have been done by his own
people, sent some knights to forbid them to proceed in their
ravages ; and of these eighteen knights were taken, together
with many men-at-arms. Shortly after, Marchades, with his
Eoutiers, entered Flanders, and attacked the fair held near Ab-
beville, and spoiled the merchants of France, and returning
into Normandy with a great booty, filled the land with the
spoils of the Franks, and slew many of them, and took with
him many captives to be put to their ransom.

After these events, Kobert, earl of Leicester, came with forty-
knights and a few men-at-arms, before the castle of Pasci,
which had belonged to him : on which the knights of the castle
sallied forth with a great number of men-at-arms and the citi-
zens of the town, for the purpose of capturing him and his
followers ; and he, being able to offer them no resistance,
escaped with difficulty, and lost four of his knights.

80 This is a repetition of the story relative to the disaster of the king of
France. They were probably copied from two different sources, and, per-
haps through an oversight of the amanuensis, both were inserted in the
chronicle.



432 . AlfffALS OF ROGER DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1198.

On the following day, however, the said earl, having called
to his aid a considerable number of the knights of the house-
hold of the king of England, came before the castle of Pasci,
having first disposed the knights and great numbers of men-at-
arms in different places, to lie in ambush for the people of the
castle. Accordingly, when the knights of the castle, who had
driven him from the field the day before, espied him, they
sallied forth with great vigour, and he fled before them, until
they fell in with those lying in ambush, on which eighteen
knights of their number were captured, and a great number of
the common soldiers.

In the meantime, Hubert, archbishop of Canterbury, crossed
over from England to Normandy, and immediately, at the
request of the king of France, and with the permission of the
king of England, proceeded into France, to treat of making-
peace between those two kings. On this, the king of France
made offer that he would, for the sake of peace, surrender to
the king of England all his lands and castles that he had seized,
with the exception of the castle of Gisors, as to which, he
would abide by the decision of six Norman barons, whom he
himself should name, and of six barons of France, whom
the king of England should name, which of the two had the
greatest right to retain possession of the castle ; but the king
of England declined, unless the earl of Flanders, and all the
others who had abandoned the king of France and become his
adherents, were included in the treaty.

In the same year, Hugh Bardolph, Master Eoger Arundel,
and Geoffrey Hacket, to whom, as judges itinerant, had been
entrusted Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, York-
shire, Northumberland, Westmoreland, Cumberland, and Lan-
caster, held pleas of the king's crown.

for it is by these and other vexations, whether justly or
unjustly, that all England has been reduced to poverty from
sea to sea.

But before these troubles were at an end, another kind of
trouble arose, to the confusion of the subjects of the realm, by
means of the justices of the forests, namely, Hugh Neville,
chief-justice of all the king's forests in England, whose sur-
name was Envellu, Hugh Wac, and Ernest de Neville. For it
was commanded the said justices itinerant of the forests, on the
king's behalf, throughout each county through which they should
proceed, to convene before them, to the pleas of the forests, the
archbishops, bishops, earls, barons, and all freeholders, and the
reeve of each town, and four other men, to hear the king's com-
mands.

In the first place, our lord the king gives notice, that if any
shall commit an offence against him, relative to his venison,
or his forests, in any way, he does not wish such to place
their confidence in the fact that he has hitherto amerced
them solely in their chattels, who have offended against him
relative to his venison, or his forests. Eor if any persons hence-
forth shall commit any offence against him relative thereto, and
shall be convicted of the same, it is his intention that the full
punishment shall be inflicted on them, as in the days of Henry,
the grandfather 91 of our lord the king, that is to say, they
are to lose their eyes and their virility. Also, our lord the
king forbids that any person shall have bows or arrows, or
dogs, or harriers, in his forests, unless he has the king as
Ids surety, or some one else to act as his surety in so doing.
The king also forbids that any one shall give or sell any-
thing to the destruction of his woods, or the waste that lies in
the king's forests ; but he gives full permission for them to
take anything that is necessary for them from their own
woods, but without waste and this in view of his forester and
verderers. He also orders all those who have woods within
the boundaries of a forest of our lord the king, to place fit and
proper foresters in their woods ; for which foresters those to
whom such woods belong are to be sureties, or are to find fitting
sureties, who may make reparation, if the foresters should offend
in anything that relates to our lord the king. He also orders that
his own foresters shall have supervision over the foresters of
the knights and others, who have woods within the boundaries of
a iorest belonging to our lord the king, in order that the woods
91 Properly greatgrandfather.

may not be destroyed. For if, after this, these woods shall
happen to be destroyed, they towhom such woods shall be-
long are distinctly to understand, that by themselves or from
their lands reparation shall be made, and not by any one else.
The king also orders that his foresters shall make oath that,
to the utmost of their ability, they will observe his assize
which he has made relative to his forests, and that they will
not be guilty of vexatious conduct towards knights or respec-
table men, by reason of this supervision which the king has
given them over their woods. The king also orders that in
every county in which he keeps venison, twelve knights shall
be appointed to keep watch over vert and venison in his forests,
and that four knights shall be appointed for agisting 92 his woods,
and for receiving his pannage, 93 and for the purpose of guarding
and protecting the same. He also orders, that no one shall
agist his own woods within the limits of his forests, before
their woods shall have been agisted; and notice is given,
that the agistments of our lord the king begin fifteen days be-
fore the feast of Saint Michael, and continue for fifteen days
after the said feast. The king also orders that, if his forester
has in his charge demesne woods of the king, and those woods
are destroyed, and he cannot, and knows not how to, show
a just cause why such woods are destroyed, nothing is to
be exacted of the said forester beyond his own body. 94 He
also orders that no clerk shall commit any offence against
him relative to his venison or his forests, and he gives strict
orders to his foresters, if they shall find them so offending,
not to hesitate to seize them, in order to prevent them
so doing, and to make them prisoners; as he will exact
sureties of them in consequence of so doing. The king also
orders that all his assarts 95 shall be viewed every third year,
after regard, 96 both old and new, and the same as to all pour-
prestures, and all wastes in his woods ; and that each of the
same shall be registered by itself. The king also orders that
the archbishops, bishops, earls, barons, knights, and freeholders,
and all men in his lands, shall come at the summons of his

chief forester, to hold pleas as to his forests. It is also to be
forbidden, at the pleas held at the forests, that any carriage
shall go out of the high road into the king's forests, or that there
shall be any swine in the king's forests in the fence times, 97 that
is to say, between fifteen days before the Nativity of Saint John
the Baptist, and fifteen days after that feast. It is also to be
known, that whoever shall commit an offence in the king's
forest, with relation to his venison, and shall be attainted of
the same, he shall be at the mercy of the king for loss of his
eyes and of his virility.

But he who shall be guilty of an offence in the king's fo-
rests, as to vert, whether by cutting down wood, or by cut-
ting down branches, or by digging turf, or by rooting up
heather, or by cutting brushwood, or by making assart, or
new pourpresture by hedge or ditch, or by removal of a mill, or
of a water-course, or of a sheep-cote, or of other houses, or by
reaping or making hay beyond his hedges or ditches, shall be
amerced by the king out of his own money, unless he shall
have the king's verderers or foresters as his warranty for so
doing. In like manner, they who carry bows or arrows, or
who lead dogs without a couple through the king's forests, and
shall be attainted of the same, shall be amerced by the king.

It is also enacted, that view of forest shall always be
made every third year ; and in regard of forest, the several
matters above-mentioned are to be seen to. Also, in regard,
new assarts are to be viewed, and what old ones have been
sown since the last regard, and with what corn or pulse they
have been sown. Fresh assarts shall be seized to the king's
use ; if old assarts shall have been sown with wheat or with
winter wheat, then each acre shall pay to the king twelve-
pence from the said crop ; and if they shall have been sown
with oats, barley, beans, peas, or any other pulse, then each
acre shall pay to the king six-pence from the said crop.

It is also deserving to be known, that in the time of king
Henry, son of the empress Matilda, it had been allowed for
ditches to be made within the boundaries of the forests in-
stead of hedges.; and the said Henry enacted at "Woodstock,
that whoever should commit an offence against him as to his
forests, relative to the venison therein, on the first occasion,
safe sureties should be exacted of him ; if he should offend a
second time, safe sureties were to be similarly exacted of him ;
97 Fawning season.

but if he should likewise offend a third time, for the third
offence no sureties were to be exacted, but the offender's own
body.

In the same year, the men of the religious orders refused 98
to pay the king five shillings for each carucate in tillage, as
the other subjects of the kingdom did; on which, an edict
went forth from the king,^that whoever in his kingdom should
commit an offence against a clerk or any other member of the
religious orders, he should not be compelled to make satisfac-
tion to him ; but if any clerk or other member of the reli-
gious orders should commit an offence against any layman, he
should be immediately compelled to make satisfaction to him ;
in consequence of which, the members of the religious orders
were compelled to ransom themselves" [from this grievance].

The king also issued orders, that all persons, both clerks as
well as laymen, who had charters or confirmations under
his old seal, should bring them to be renewed under his new
seal ; and if they should omit to do so, nothing that was done
under his old seal should be held to be ratified.

In the same year, pope Innocent sent letters of entreaty to
Richard, king of England, in favour of Geoffrey, archbishop
of York, begging him and, with paternal admonitions, exhorting
him to receive the said archbishop, after his prayers and ser-
vices, into his favour and brotherly love, and permit him in
peace to return to his place, in order that he might not be
obliged to proceed to ecclesiastical censure against him and his
kingdom. Inconsequence of this, Richard, king of England,
sent to the said archbishop, Philip, bishop of Durham, Eustace,
bishop of Ely, Godfrey, bishop of Winchester, John, bishop of
Worcester, and Savaric, bishop of Bath, begging, in a spirit of
humility, on the king's behalf, that he would ratify the pre-
sentations which the king had made in the church of York,
on which, the king would restore to him his archbishopric in
its full entirety.

To these persons the archbishop made answer, " You are my
fellow-brethren, and I will do what you advise me, if you will
give me your assurance in writing under the testimony of your
seals, that you will stand by that advice in the presence of
our lord the pope." On this, the said bishops made answer,

" We shall give you no writing, but it must be left to your
own discretion ; you are of sufficient age, therefore speak for
yourself;" and so saying, those who had been sent returned to
the king with the archbishop's answer.

On this, the archbishop set out for Rome, and the king of
England sent envoys to Rome to oppose him, who [afterwards]
wrote to him to the following effect: "Our lord the pope
writes to you with earnest supplications, that you will restore
to the archbishop of York his archbishopric in full, together
with the revenues that have been received from the arch-
bishopric, upon condition, however, that he shall pay the sums
of money in which we have alleged him to be indebted to you,
wholly, and in full. He has also written to our lord the car-
dinal and some others, that they are to advise and induce you
to do so ; and if you persist in refusing the same, they are to
compel you, first, by interdict of the province of York, and
after that by interdict of the whole kingdom, all power of appeal
withdrawn. Furthermore, according to the aforesaid instruc-
tions, your clerks are to be strictly compelled, by the cardinal,
to give up all the revenues which in the meantime they have
received, unless they can defend themselves, either on the au-
thority of the Church of Rome, or on the grounds of delay
[to present] within six months, according to the statute of the
council of Lateran, the time of his suspension being excepted
therefrom. The canons of York are to be advised to come to
a reconciliation, and if any new point shall arise, both parties
are again to present themselves before our lord the pope, the
privileges of the canons [meantime] remaining in their usual
force."

In the same year, during the summer, in a certain city in
Italy, not far from Genoa, a thing took place that deserves to
be related. In this city, first, one of the citizens, his sins
so demanding it, became possessed, that is to say, a daemoniac ;
and in a few days the number of them increased to such a de-
gree, that each person was in dread for himself, lest a similar
danger might befall him. Upon this, by the common advice
of the citizens, some religious men were summoned to the city,
and especially the abbat of Lucca, of the Cistercian order, who
was called, and seemed to be the greatest authority among them
in matters of religion, in order that they might deliberate upon
what was to be done for the citizens thus terror-stricken. Ac-
cordingly, a fast for three days was proclaimed. On the third



A.D. 1198. DECISION AS TO THE 3IANOE OF CLIFF. 439

day the daemoniacs were summoned into their presence, and the
said abbat adjured them in the name of Jesus Christ, that they
would explain the cause why they had dared to annoy that
city more than others, and to depart from the servants of Christ
who had been signed with this name. 1 On this, one of them,
crying out with a loud and terrible voice, exclaimed: ''Are you
for compelling us to come forth from the vessels that have been
reasonably assigned to us ? Why, we are that legion of devils
which your Jesus, after casting them out from the man, allowed
to hurl the swine from the rock into the sea. But now, being
released from the chains in which we were bound, we have re-
ceived power over the blasphemers only of the Virgin Mary ;
and in this city we have found such persons, and having
found them, it is our duty to torment them as they deserve.
Wherefore, if we are driven out, know that you, hypocrite, and
your order we shall torment the next." At his second com-
mand, however, they came forth, though with great difficulty,
leaving the traces of their foul footsteps behind.

In the same year, Aimeric de Lusignan, king of Baruth, 2
Accaron, prince of the Isle of Cyprus, and the other Christians
in the land of Sulia, and the pagans, made a truce, to commence
from the feast of the Nativity of Saint John the Baptist, and
to last for the next six years, unless some powerful king of the
Christians should arrive in those parts. In the same year also,
Richard, king of England, and Philip, king of France, made a
truce in the month of November, to last till the feast of Saint
Hilary next ensuing.

In the same year, Philip, bishop of Durham, at the petition
of Robert de Turnham, granted him, in the king's presence, a
jury of twelve lawful men of the vicinity of Clif, to enquire
'which of them had the greater right to the said manor of Clif :
that is to say, whether the said Robert ought to hold the said
manor of the bishop of Durham, and to do homage to him for
the same, or whether the bishop ought to hold it in demesne.
Accordingly, on the oath of twelve lawful men, it was declared
that that manor was the hereditary right of the wife of the
said Robert, daughter 3 of William Fossard, and so the said
bishop lost the manor of Clif, which his predecesssors had,
for a long period, peaceably and inviolably held. This took place
at York, before Hugh Bardolph, Master Roger Arundel, and
Geoffrey Hacket, at this time justices of the pleas of the crown.

In the same year, upon the death of Master Eichard of Col-
dingham, Philip, bishop of Durham, and Bertram, prior of the
church of Durham, disagreed as to the right of presentation of
the churches of the aforesaid Richard. For the bishop said
that the presentation belonged to him, as bishop and abbat of
the church of Durham ; to which, the prior made answer, that
the presentation belonged to him, because his predecessors and
himself, without any one gainsaying it, had presented the same
as priors and lords of the soil, and that they held all the power
of abbat in the choir, and in the management of the house, and
of their revenues, by grant of the king, and through institution
by the bishops of Durham, and confirmation by the Pontiffs of
Rome. But this controversy was not allowed to rest, indeed it
increased to such a degree, that by order of the bishop of Dur-
ham, Aimeric, the archdeacon of Durham, blockaded the church
of Saint Oswald, in Elvet, to which the monks had retired,
and would not allow provisions to be carried to them. One day
even, after appeal had been made to the pope by the monks,
the said Aimeric caused fire to be set to the door of the church,
that thus, by means of the smoke and vapour, the fire might
expel the monks. However, God changed the feelings of the
bishop for the better, and, out of respect for Saint Cuthbert, he
bestowed the said church on the monks, for their sole use, and
by his charter confirmed the same ; he also granted them the
free disposal of their churches, though with but a tardy assent
on his part.

In the same year, pope Innocent, during the affliction of
the Christians who were in the land of Jerusalem, wrote to the
following effect :

The Letter of pope Innocent, on giving succour to the Holy Land.
" Innocent, the bishop, servant of the servants of God, to his
venerable brethren, the archbishop of York and his suffragans,
and his dearly beloved sons, the abbats, priors, and other pre-
lates of churches, and the earls, barons, and all the people of the
province of York, health and the Apostolic benediction. After
the sad fall of the kingdom of Jerusalem, after the lamentable
slaughter of the people of Christendom, after the deplorable in-
vasion of that land on which the feet of Christ had stood, and
where God, our king, had deigned to work salvation in the midst
of the earth, after the ignominious retreat of the vivifying Cross



A.D. 1198. LETTEE OF POPE INNOCENT. 441

on which the salvation of the world had been suspended, and
had thereby blotted out the handwriting of former death, the
Apostolic See, alarmed at the sad occurrence of mishaps so un-
fortunate, was affected with, agonizing grief, exclaiming and
bewailing to such a degree that, from her continual crying, her
throat became hoarse, and from excessive weeping, her eyes
became dim. But, in the words of the prophet, 4 ' If I forget
thee, Jerusalem, let my right hand forget.her cunning. If
I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of
my mouth.' Still does the Apostolic See shout aloud, and like
a trumpet does she raise her voice, endeavouring to arouse the
nations of Christendom to fight the battles of Christ, and to
avenge the injuries done to Him crucified, using the words of
him who says, ' All ye that pass by, behold and see if there be
any sorrow like unto my sorrow.' 5 For behold, our inheritance
has gone to strangers, our houses to other people, ' The ways
of Zion mourn, because none come to the solemn feasts . . her
adversaries are the chief.' 6 The Sepulchre of the Lord, which
the prophet foretold should be so glorious, has been profaned by
the unrighteous, and has been thereby made inglorious. Our
glory, of which the Apostle speaks when he says, ' God forbid
that I should glory save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ,' 7
is held in the hands of the enemy, and our Lord Jesus Christ,
who, by dying for us, led our captivity captive, as though Himself
a captive, is driven in exile from His inheritance. In former
days, when the ark of the Lord of Sabaoth abode in tents, Uriah
refused to enter his 8 house, and withheld himself from the law-
ful embraces of his wife. 9 But at the present day, our princes,
the glory of Israel having been transferred from its place, to our
disgrace, give themselves up to adulterous embraces, thereby
abusing their luxuries and their wealth ; and, while they are
harassing each other, with inexorable hatred, while one is using
all his endeavours to take vengeance on another for injuries
done, there is not a person who is moved by the injuries of Him
crucified, not considering that now our enemies are insulting us,
saying, * Where is your God, who can neither deliver himself nor
you from our hands ? Behold ! now have we profaned your sanc-
tuaries ; behold ! now have we extended our hands to the ob-

jects of your desires, and have, at the first attack, with the hand
of violence seized upon those places ; and, whether you will or
no, we hold possession of the spots in which you pretend that
your 10 superstition took its rise. Already, have we weakened
and broken asunder the lances of the Gauls, baffled the efforts
of the English, crushed the strength n of the Germans,
and now for the second time subdued the haughty Spani-
ards; and though you thought to arouse all your might
against us, hardly in any of your attempts did you succeed.
Where then is your God ? Let him arise now and help you,
and let him be the protector of yourselves and of himself. The
Germans indeed, who presumed that they should gain over us
unheard-of triumphs, with ardent spirits crossed the seas to
our land : and after they had taken the single fortified place
of Baruth, when no one was defending it, unless the assist-
ance of flight had come to the aid of them and the rest of
your potentates, they would have wofully experienced upon
themselves our might, and their descendants would have for
ever bewailed the slaughter we had made of them. And as for
your kings and princes, whom we formerly drove out of the
lands of the East, in order that they may conceal their terror by
putting on a show of daring, after returning to their skulking
places, we will not say kingdoms, they prefer to attack e'ach
other, rather than once more experience our strength and our
might. What then remains except that, those being cut off
by the avenging sword, whom, running away, you dismissed
for your own purposes and to restore peace to your territo-
ries, we should make an attack upon your territories, for
the purpose of destroying your name and your memory?'
How then, brethren and sons, are we to rebut the insults
of these insulters, in what terms shall we be able to answer
them ? When are we to see them on their side in pursuit of
the truth, 12 judging by what has lately reached our hearing
upon certain information ? For we have received letters from
parts beyond seas, to the effect that when the Germans had
reached Acre with their fleet, they seized the castle of Bar-
uth, there being no one to defend it ; while the Saracens,
making an assault upon Joppa on the other side gained pos-
session of it by storm, and having slain many thousand

Christians therein levelled it with the ground. As for the
Germans, on hearing rumours of the death of the Emperor,
not waiting for the usual time of making the passage, they
embarked on board their ships for the purpose of returning
home. On this, the Saracens, who had collected a numerous
army, raged with such violence against the territories of the
Christians, that it was not possible for the Christians without
great danger to go out of their cities, nor yet to remain in
them without dread ; and too truly their sword has its horrors
without, its anxious fears within. Take, therefore, my sons, the
spirit of fortitude, the shield of faith, and the helmet of salva-
tion, 13 putting your trust not in numbers or in your strength,
but rather trusting in the power of God, to whom it is not diffi-
cult to save whether with many or with few, and rush to the suc-
cour of Him by whom you exist, and live, and have your being. 14
For in your behalves it was that * He made himself of no reputa-
tion, and took upon Him the form of a servant, and was made
in the likeness of men ; and being found in fashion as a man,
He humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the
death of the cross ;' 15 and yet, while He is poor, you abound,
while He is put to flight, you are at rest, and do not, while He
is in want and exile, come to His aid. Who, then, in a case
of such great emergency, shall refuse to pay obedience to Jesus
Christ ? When he comes to stand before His 'tribunal to be
judged, what answer will he be able to make to Him in defence
of himself ? If God has submitted to death for man, is man
to hesitate to submit to death for God ? ' For the sufferings
of the present time are not worthy to be compared with the
glory which shall be revealed in us.' 16 Shall, then, the servant
deny to his lord temporal riches, when his lord bestows upon
the servant riches that are eternal ; ' which eye hath not seen,
nor ear heard, neither hath it entered into the heart of man >i7
to conceive ? Therefore it is that a man should ( lay up
treasures in heaven, where thieves do not break through nor
steal, nor moth nor rust corrupt.' 18 Let each and all, then,
prepare themselves, that in the month of March next ensuing,
each city by itself, and, in like manner, each of the earls and
barons may, according to their respective means, send forth a
number of warriors to the defence of the land of the nativity
of our Lord, to be supported at ascertained sums, and there to

remain for two years at least. For, although daily anxieties
in behalf of all the churches are pressing upon us, still, this
in especial do we conceive as one of our anxieties, our desire to
apply every energy to the rescue of the lands of the East ; lest if
succour should chance to be delayed, the bruch 19 may devour the re-
sidue of the locust, and the last state become worse than the first.
But, that we may not seem to lay grievous and insupportable
burdens on the shoulders of other men, and to be unwilling
with our finger to move the same, saying so much, and doing
little or nothing at all, and, inasmuch as he who both does and
teaches is to be called great in the kingdom of heaven, after
the example of Him who began to do and to teach, to the end
that we, who, unworthy as we are to act as His vicars upon
earth, may set a good example to others, we have determined,
both in person and in deed, to aid the Holy Land ; and have
appointed our dearly beloved son, Stephen, cardinal priest and
titular of Saint Praxedes, and Peter, cardinal deacon and titular
of Saint Mary in Yia lata, legates of the Apostolic See, men
fearers of God, famous for their knowledge and their probity,
powerful both in word and deed, and whom, among our other
brethren, we do in especial love and esteem, after having, with
our own hand, placed upon them the sign of the cross, humbly
and devoutly to precede the army of the Lord, and not to be
supported by offerings given through charity, but at our own
cost, and at that of our brethren ; by whom also we have de-
termined upon sending other availble aid to the said land.
Wherefore, in the meantime, we have sent the said Peter,
cardinal deacon and titular of Saint Mary in Yia lata, 20 unto
the presence of our most dearly beloved sons in Christ, the
most illustrious kings, Philip, king of the Franks, and Eichard,
king of the English, for the purpose of effecting a reconciliation
between them, or at least obtaining a truce for five years, and
exhorting the people to obedience to Him crucified : and whom,
as legate to the Apostolic See, we will and command to be honored
by all, and obedience to be humbly shewn to his mandates and
enactments. But the aforesaid Stephen, cardinal priest and
titular of Saint Praxedes, we are about to send to Venice, to
obtain succour for the Holy Land. Moreover, by the common
advice of our brethren, we have resolved, and do strictly

19 This seems to have been an ancient proverb. The " bruchus " was

guage. 20 He is also called cardinal of Capua.



A.D. 1198. LETTER OF POPE INNOCENT. 445

enjoin and command you, our brethren the archbishops and
bishops, and our dearly beloved sons, the abbats, and other
prelates of churches, forthwith to levy a certain number of
soldiers, or, in place of such certain number, a fixed amount of
money, in the month of March next ensuing, due consideration
being had of the means of each, for the purpose of attacking
the barbarous tribes of the pagans, and preserving the inherit-
ance of the Lord, which with His own blood He 1 has obtained.
But if any person, (a thing that we cannot believe>) shall dare
to oppose an ordinance so pious and so necessary, we have de-
termined that he shall be punished as a transgressor of the
sacred canons, and do order that he shall be suspended from
his duties until such time as he shall have made due satisfac-
tion for the same. Wherefore, trusting in the mercy of God,
and in the authority of the blessed Apostles, Saint Peter and
Saint Paul, and in that power of binding and unloosing which,
unworthy as we are, God has bestowed upon us, we do, in the
case of those who, in their own persons and at their own
expense, shall undergo the labours of this expedition, grant
them plenary pardon for those sins for which they have done
penance with voice and heart, and do promise them the blessing
of everlasting salvation as the reward of the just. And,
to those who shall not have gone thither in their own
persons, but only, at their own expense, shall have, ac-
cording to their means and rank, sent fit and proper men,
to stay there for two years at least, and to those likewise,
who, although at the expense of others, shall, in their
own persons, have undergone the labours of the pilgrimage
which they have undertaken, we do also grant plenary pardon
for their sins. We do also will that all persons shall be par-
takers in this remission, who shall give suitable aid to the said
land at their own cost, according to the amount of the aid
they shall so give, and especially in proportion to the feelings
of devotedness they shall manifest. And, in order that all
persons may prepare more expeditiously and more securely for
going to the aid of the land of the nativity of our Lord, we do take
their property from the time that they shall have assumed
the cross, under the care of Saint Peter and of ourselves ; and
the same is likewise to be under the protection of the arch-
bishops, bishops, and other prelates of the church of God ;
it being our order that until their death or return is to a cer-
tainty ascertained, the same shall remain safe and untouched.



446 A1WALS OF KOGER DE HOVEDEIT. A.D. 1198.

And if any person shall presume to contravene this ordinance,
he is to be forced by ecclesiastical censure to the observance
thereof. Therefore, let no person entirely withhold him-
self from this work, inasmuch as the same has not been com-
menced by ourselves, but by the Apostles themselves, who
made collection among the nations, that they might succour
the brethren who were labouring in Jerusalem. And further,
"we do wish you not to despair of the Divine mercy, how-
ever much the Lord may be offended at our sins, who, by
your hand may effect, (if, as you ought to do, you set out upon
your pilgrimage with all humility of heart and of body,) that
which he did not grant to your forefathers. For, probably,
our forefathers would have conspired together, and would have
said, * our own high hand, and not the Lord hath done all this ;'
and to themselves, and not to the Lord they would have as-
cribed the glory of the victory. We do also trust, that He
will not in His wrath withhold His mercies, who, when He
is angered, does not forget to show mercy, admonishing and
exhorting us, saying, ' Turn unto me, and I will turn unto
you.' We do also believe, that if you walk in the law of the
Lord, not following in the footsteps of those, who, going after
vanity, have become vain, who gave themselves up to junket-
tin'gs and to drunken revellings, and did those things in the
parts beyond sea, which, in the land of their own nativity,
they would not dare to do without having to endure great
infamy and considerable disgrace, but, placing your hopes of
victory in Him alone, wfeo does not forsake those who put
their trust in Him, and abstain not only from what is unlawful,
but also from many things that are lawful, He, who overthrew
the chariot and the hosts of Pharaoh in the Red Sea, will render
weak the bow of the strong, and will sweep away from before
your faces the enemies of the Cross of Christ as though the very
dirt of the streets ; not, indeed, giving to us or to you the glory,
but to His own name, who is glorious in His Saints, wondrous
in His majesty, a worker of marvels, and, after tears and weep-
ing, the giver of joy and gladness. Moreover, if any of those
who shall go on the pilgrimage, shall at the time be bound by
oath to pay interest, we do, brother archbishops and bishops,
command their creditors 21 in your several dioceses to be com-
pelled by you, by force of ecclesiastical compulsion, all obstacle
by appeal removed, entirely to absolve them from their said

oaths, and to cease to demand from them any farther in-
terest. And if any one of their creditors shall compel them to
payment of interest, then let him be compelled by you, by means
of similar compulsion, all obstacle by appeal removed, to make
restitution of the same. Jews also, you princes our sons, we do
command to be compelled by you, and by means of the secular
power, to forego all interest from such ; and until such re-
mission shall have been made, we do, under sentence of ex-
communication, order every kind of communication with them
to be withheld by all the faithful of Christ, either in matters
of trade or in any other matters whatsoever. Also, for the pur-
pose of more expeditiously and more perfectly carrying out
these commands in your province, we have thought proper
to depute you, our sons, the prior of Thurgarton 22 and Master
Vacarus, to announce the words of the Lord to the others, and,
inviting our venerable brethren, your archbishop and his suf-
fragans, and the others, to the fulfilment of this Apostolic man-
date, so to promote the cause of the Lord that you may both be
partakers of this remission, and that in this your devoutness may
more fully shine forth. Also, for* the more laudable promotion
of the same, you are to associate with yourselves herein one
of the brethren of the order of the Temple, as also one of the
brethren of the Hospital of Jerusalem, men of character and
prudence. Given at Saint Peter's, at Rome, on the ides of
August, in the first year of our pontificate."

In the same year, there was in France a certain priest, named
Fulk, whom the Lord magnified in the sight of kings, and gave
him power to make the blind to see, to cure the lame, and dumb,
and others afflicted with divers maladies, and to drive out devils.
Even harlots, escaping from the bonds of unchasteness, he con-
verted unto the Lord, and led usurers, by inviting them to that
heavenly treasure, which neither rust nor moth corrupteth, nor
thieves steal, to distribute for the use of the poor all that sub-
stance which their usury and exactions had devoured.

He also foretold to the kings of France and England, that
one of them would die an unfortunate death before long, unless
they speedily desisted from their hostilities. And, because at
this time the harvest was plentiful, and the workmen few, the
Lord joined unto him wise men, to preach the words of salva-
vation, Master Peter and Lord Robert, and Eustace, the lord
abbat of Flaye, besides some others, who, being sent throughout
23 A house of canons regular in Nottinghamshire,

the earth, preached in every part, the Lord assisting them and
confirming their words by signs attending them.

One day the before-named Fulk came to Richard, king of
England, and said to him, " I warn thee, king, on behalf of
Almighty God, to marry as soon as possible the three most
shameless daughters whom thou hast, lest something worse
befall thee. Oh, place thy finger on thy lips, for he will
prove an accuser who has told the truth. ~No man is born
without faults ; blessed is he who is burdened with the fewest ;
and elsewhere are we informed that there is no man living free
from fault." To this the king is said to have made answer :
" Hypocrite, to thy face thou hast lied, inasmuch as I have no
daughter whatever ;" on which Fulk replied and said, "Beyond
a doubt, I do not He, because, as I said, thou hast three most
shameless daughters, of whom one is pride, the second avarice,
and the third sensuality."

Accordingly, having called around him many earls and
barons who were present, the king said : " Listen, all of you,
to the warning of this hypocrite, who says that I have three
most shameless daughters, njfmely, pride, avarice, and sensual-
ity, and recommends me to get them married : I therefore give
my pride to the Knights Templars, my avarice to the monks
of the Cistercian order, and my sensuality to the prelates of
the churches." Oh great disgrace, to create a laugh at the ex-
pense of the wretched !

After this, Fulk, leaving the king, departed, preaching the
word of God from city to city ; and when, so preaching the
word of God, he had entered the city of Lisieux, the clergy of
that city, whose unclean lips this man, filled with the Holy
Ghost and good works, had reproved, laid hands on him, and,
binding him with chains, threw him into prison. But neither
chains nor prisons could restrain him, and so, being permitted
to depart, he came to Caen, preaching the word of God, and
did many miracles in the sight of the people. The keepers,
however, of the castle, thinking that it would please the king,
laid hands on him, and, placing him in fetters, threw him into
prison ; but bursting forth from the prison and the fetters, he
came forth unharmed, and went his way rejoicing that he had
been deemed worthy to suffer reproach for the name of Christ,
and, going from the castle, he shook the dust from off his feet
as a testimony against them.

In the same year, on the fifth day before the ides of

October, being the Lord's day, at the entreaty of the officers
of Geoffrey, archbishop of York, Philip, bishop of Durham, at
Hoveden, consecrated Adam, abbat of Sallaie, and Hamo,
abbat of Beiland, profession of canonical obedience being made
to the church of York and its vicars, saving always the dignity
of their order. In the same month, William, surnamed Coke, a
servant of Richard, king of England, while keeping charge of
the castle of Leuns, took of the household of the king of
France, twenty-four men at arms, horsemen, and forty men at
arms, foot, whom the king of France had sent for the purpose
of guarding the castle of Newmarche.

In the same year died Richard, bishop of London, John,
bishop of Worcester, William de Yer, bishop of Hereford, the
bishop of Saint David's, and Amfrid of Tours, the first husband
of the before-mentioned Milicent, wife of Guido, the former
king of Jerusalem.

In the same year died at Palermo, in Sicily, Constance, the
former empress of the Romans, wife of the emperor Henry ;
whose son pope Innocent received into his charge, together
with the kingdom of Sicily, the dukedom of Apulia, and the
principality of Capua.

In the same year, Philip, bishop of Beauvais, offered to Richard,
king of England, a thousand marks of silver for his ransom.
In this year also, Richard, king of England, founded a castle
on an island at the mouth of the Seine, which he called Butte-
vant, 23 and the king of France fortified a castle opposite to it,
which he called Bulecut. In the same year, Richard, king of
England, gave to master Malgar, his clerk, the bishopric of
Worcester.

Upon the decease of pope Celestinus, pope Innocent the Third
being appointed in his place, he again suspended Alphonso,
king of Saint Jago, and the whole of his territory from the
celebration of Divine service, on account of his wife, the
daughter of the king of Castille, for they were cousins in the
third degree ; and although the king of Saint Jago offered to
our lord the pope Innocent and the cardinals twenty thousand
marks of silver, and to keep and pay two hundred knights
during the space of one year for the defence of the Chris-
tians against the Pagans, only on condition that our lord
the pope should allow them to remain together, until God
should give them issue, or at least for three years, our lord

the pope Innocent utterly refused to sanction their doing the



In the year of grace 1199, being the tenth and last year of
the reign of Richard, king of England, the said Richard was at
Damfront, in Normandy, on the day of the Nativity of our
Lord, which took place on the sixth day of the week, and
Philip, king of France, was on the same day at Yernon,
in Normandy. Otho, king of the Germans, and nephew of
Richard, king of England, was on the same day at West-
phalia, in Almaine, which is distant nine days' journey from
Cologne, and which places Otho, by his prowess and valour,
had gained against Philip, duke of Suabia, son of Frederic, the
former emperor of the Romans.

Immediately after the Nativity of our Lord, the said Otho
divided his army into two parts, and laid siege to two cities of
the before-named Philip. The kings of France and England,
however, met for a conference between Andely and Yernon,
on the feast of Saint Hilary ; on which occasion the king of
England came thither in a boat up the river Seine, and not
wishing to land, spoke from the boat with the king of France,
who, sitting on horseback on the banks of the river, conversed
with the king of England face to face ; and there they ap-
pointed another day for holding the conference, when, in pre-
sence of a greater number of their followers, through the me-
diation of the lord cardinal deacon Peter of Capua, titular of
Saint Mary in Yia Lata, legate of the Apostolic See, and in
accordance with the advice of other influential persons on
either side, they agreed upon a truce to be observed between
them, from the said feast of Saint Hilary, to last for the period
of five years, with good faith and without evil intent, their
property and tenements remaining on both sides in the same
state in which they then were ; and after these arrangements
had been made and confirmed by oath, each returned to his
own country ; and they allowed their armies, after returning
them their thanks, to return to their homes.

While, however, Marchades, with his Routiers, was returning
towards his own country, four counts of the kingdom of France,
through whose lands Marchades had to pass, met him with a
hostile force, and worsted him, and slew many of his men.
But the king of France disowned this deed, and swore that it
had not been done through him. After this, while the king
of England, in expectation of enjoying peace and in obser-
vance of the aforesaid treaty, had gone towards Poitou, the



A.D. 1199. CHAEGE AGAINST EAEL JOHN. 451

king of Prance erected a new castle between Buttevant and
Guaillon, and rooted up a forest belonging to the king of
England, in the neighbourhood of the said place.

On the king of England hearing of this, he returned into
Normandy, and sent word to the king of France, by Eustace,
bishop of Ely, his chancellor, that the truce was broken, un-
less he should cause the said new castle to be levelled. The
legate accordingly advised the king of France to demolish the,,
said castle, in order that a truce so solemnly confirmed might
not, for such a reason, be broken ; and, at his solicitation, the
king of France promised that he would shortly level the said
castle. But Richard, king of England, being far from con-
tented with this, desired that either a full understanding
should be come to between them, or else that no peace should
be made between them.

Accordingly, a treaty was made between them, to the fol-
lowing eflPect : that the king of France should restore to the king
of England, the whole of the territories which he had taken
from him, whether in war, or whether in any other way, with
the sole exception of the castle of Gisors ; in return for which,
the king of France, granted to Richard, king of England, the
presentation to the archbishopric of Tours. It was also ar-
ranged, that Louis, the son of the king of France, should
marry the daughter of the king of Castille, the niece of Richard,
king of England, and that the king of France should make
oath, that he would, to the utmost of his ability, aid Otho, the
nephew of the king of England, in gaining the Roman em-
pire. In return for this, Richard, king of England, was to
give to Louis, son of the king of France, the castle of Gisors,
with his said niece in marriage, and was also to give him
twenty thousand marks of silver. However, all these things
had to be delayed till such time as Richard, king of England,
should return from Poitou.

Philip, king of France, however, that sower of discord, sent
word to the king of England, that John, earl of Mortaigne,
his brother, had entirely placed himself in his hands, and
that he would show him the document signed by John him-
self to that effect. A thing much to be wondered at ! the
king of England believed the king of France, and held his
brother John in hatred, so much so, that he caused him to be
disseised of his lands on both sides of the sea. When,
however, the said John enquired what was the cause of this

GG 2

indignation and hatred, it was told him, that the king of
France had sent the above message relative to him to the
king his brother. In consequence of this, the said earl of
Mortaigne sent two knights in his behalf to the court of
the king of France, who offered in every way to make proof
that he was innocent of the said charge, or to defend him, ac-
cording as the court of the king of France should think proper.
%But in this court there was not found a single person, either
the king, or any one else, who was willing to receive this
proof of the matter, or challenge of defence. In consequence
of this, from this period the king of England received his
brother John into greater favour, and gave less credit to the
messages of the king of France.

In the meantime, Richard, king of England, by the advice of
Hubert, archbishop of Canterbury, took away from Savaric,
bishop of Bath, the abbey of Glastonbury, and gave it to Master
William la Pie, on which he was made abbat thereof.

At this period, Guidomar, viscount de Limoges, having
found a great treasure of gold and silver on his lands, sent to
Richard, king of England, his liege lord, no small part of the
same ; but the king refused it, saying that he ought in right of
his grant 24 to have the whole of the said treasure ; a thing that
the said viscount would on no account agree to. Accordingly,
the king of England repaired with a large force to his territory,
for t^ie purpose of attacking the said viscount, and laid siege to
his castle, the name of which was Chalus, in which he hoped
that the said treasure was concealed ; and when the knights
and men-at-arms, who were in the castle, came forth and
offered him the castle, on condition of safety to life and limb,
and of retaining their arms, the king refused to receive it, but
swore that he would take them by storm and hang them all.

Accordingly, the knights and men-at-arms returned to the
castle in sorrow and confusion, and prepared to make a defence.
On the same day, when the king of England and Marchades
were reconnoitring the castle on all sides, and examining in
which spot it would be most advisable to make the assault, a
certain arbalister, Bertram de Gurdun 25 by name, aimed aii
arrow from the castle, and struck the king on the arm, inflict-
ing an incurable wound. The king, on being wounded, mounted
his horse and rode to his quarters, and issued orders to Mar-

25 He is called Peter Basil by some writers.

ehades and the whole of the army to make assaults on the
castle without intermission, until it should be taken ; which
was accordingly done. After its capture, the king ordered all
the people to be hanged, him alone excepted who had wounded
him, whom, as we may reasonably suppose, he would have
condemned to a most shocking death if he had recovered.

After this, the king gave himself into the hands of a physi-
cian of Marchades, who, after attempting to extract the iron
head, extracted the wood only, while the iron remained in the
flesh ; but after this butcher had carelessly mangled the king's
arm in every part, he at last extracted the arrow. When the
king was now in despair of surviving, he devised to his brother
John the kingdom of England and all his other territories, and
ordered fealty to be done to the aforesaid John by those who
were present, and commanded that his castles should be delivered
to him, and three-fourths of his treasures. All his jewels he
devised to his nephew Otho, the king of Germany, and the
fourth part of his treasure he ordered to be distributed among
his servants and the poor.

He then ordered Bertram de Gurdun, who had wounded
him, to come into his presence, and said to him, " What harm
have I done to you, that you have killed me ?" On which he
made answer, " You slew my father and my two brothers with
your own hand, and you had intended now to kill me ; there-
fore, take any revenge on me that you may think fit, for I will
readily endure the greatest torments you can devise, so long as
you have met with your end, after having inflicted evils so many
and so great upon the world." On this, the king ordered him
to be released, and said, " I forgive you my death." But the
youth " stood before the feet of the king, and with scowling
features, and undaunted neck, did his courage demand the
sword. The king was aware that punishment was wished for,
and that pardon was dreaded. ' Live on, ' said he, ' although thou
art unwilling, and by my bounty behold the light of day. To
the conquered faction now let there be bright hopes, and the
example of myself/' 26 And then, after being released from his

chains, he was allowed to depart, and the king ordered one
hundred shillings of English money to he given him. Mar-
ehades, however, the king not knowing of it, seized him, and
after the king's death, first flaying him alive, had him hanged. 27

The king then gave orders that his brains, his blood, and his
entrails should be buried at Chalus, his heart at Bouen, and
his body at at Fontevraud, at the feet of his father. He de-
parted this life on the eighth day before the ides of April, being
the third day of the week before Palm Sunday, and the twelfth 28
day after he had been wounded ; on which his people buried
him in the above-named places, as he had commanded.

In relation to his death, one writer says : " In this man's
death, the lion by the ant was slain. evil destiny ! in a
death so great the whole world fell.''' 29

Another wrote to this effect : "Valour, 30 avarice, crime, un-
bounded lust, foul famine, unscrupulous pride, and blind de-
sire, have reigned for twice five years ; all these an archer did
with art, hand, weapon, strength, lay prostrate." 31

Another wrote thus, "If birth and prowess could have es-
caped the confines of death, I should not have entered on the
path of fate. But think you the man exists, to whom, from
the very first, death has announced his end, and repeats aloud,
1 He is mine ! he is my own ! ' Long is the hand of death ;
than mighty Hector is death more mighty ; man takes cities,
death, man." 32

Another has written these words: "His valour could no
throng of mighty labours quell, whose way and onward pro-
gress no obstacles did retard, no roaring, no rage of the sea, no
abysses of the deep, no mountain heights, no bold and steep
ascent of the lofty range, no roughness of the path by rocks
made rugged, no windings of the road, no devious unknown
track, no fury of the winds, no clouds with showers drunk, no
thunders, dreadful visitations, no murky air." 38 [None of

27 The chronicle of Winchester says that this ruffianly Routier surren-
dered Gurdun to Joanna, the king's sister, and that she tore out his eyes,
and put him to cruel tortures, in the midst of which he expired.

these dangers prevented him] from making trial of the prow-
ess of the Sicilians, of Cyprus, of Saladin, of the pagan nations,
in arms. " And with no lagging foot does the result follow
upon the aspirations, together do they onward speed ; at the
same moment that the will is born, the result is born as well."

On the decease of king Bichard, Savaric, bishop of Bath,
immediately urged his claims against Master "William La Pie,
abbat of Glastonbury, and asserted his right before our lord
the pope Innocent, in presence of all the cardinals, saying
that Richard, king of England, had given him the said abbacy
of Glastonbury, to hold the same for life, and that afterwards,
listening to bad advice, he had unjustly taken it from him ;
he also constantly affirmed, being prepared in every way to
prove the same, that in ancient times there was at Glastonbury
an episcopal see, which is the one now at Bath ; and he de-
manded restitution to be made to him thereof, that he might
be enabled to transfer thither the episcopal see which is now
at Bath.

Immediately on the death of king Richard, Philip, king of
France, made a hostile attack on the city of Evreux, and took
it, and subjugated the whole of that county.

In the same year, on Saint Patrick's day, that is, on the six-
teenth day before the calends of April, being the fourth day of
the week, Jocelyn, the venerable bishop of Glasgow, departed
this life, at Melrose, of which place he had been the revered
abbat ; and was buried there, in the choir of the monks, on the
northern side of the church.

On the death of pope Celestinus and the election of pope In-
nocent in his place, Canute, king of the Danes, sent envoys to
Rome, to wait upon pope Innocent, and to complain to him of
Philip, king of France, who had unjustly repudiated his wife
Botilda, his sister, and taken another wife in her stead. He
also made complaint to our lord the pope, against William,
archbishop of Rheims, and the other bishops, counts, and barons
of France, through whom this divorce had been effected between
the king of France, and queen Botilda, after appeal made by
her to our lord the pope. Accordingly, at the instance of Ca-
nute, king of the Danes, our lord the pope Innocent gave orders
to Peter of Capua, the cardinal, and legate of the Apostolic See,
to use every possible endeavour to induce the king of France
to put away his adulteress, and to take again his wife Botilda,
and if he should not do so, to pronounce sentence of interdict
upon the kingdom of France.

KING JOHN.

ON the decease of Kichard, king of England, John, earl of
Mortaigne, his brother, who was then staying in Normandy,
immediately sent to England, Hubert, archbishop of Canter-
bury, and WilliamMarshal, earl of Striguil, in order to preserve
the peace in England, together with Geoffrey Fitz-Peter, the
justiciary of England, and other barons of the kingdom. John
himself then proceeded to Chinon, where the treasures of his
brother were; which Robert de Turnham, who had the
charge thereof, delivered up to him,, together with the castle of
Chinon, the castle of Saumur, and others of the king's castles
of which he had the charge. Thomas de Furnes, however, the
nephew of the before-named Robert de Turnham, delivered to
Arthur, duke of Brittany, the city and castle of Anjou. For
the chief men of Anjou, Maine, and Touraine, had met together,
and given in their adhesion to Arthur, duke of Brittany, as
their liege lord, saying that it was their opinion and the custom
of those parts, that the son of the elder brother should succeed
to what was due to him as his patrimony, namely, the inheri-

B



tance which Geoffrey, earl of Brittany.
would have hacTTFhe had survived Richard, king of "EnglanH,
his brother ; and, consequently, they delivered up to Arthur,
Anjou, Touraine, and Maine. On this, Constance, countess of
Brittany, the mother of Arthur, came to Touraine, and delivered
to Philip, king of France, her son Arthur ; whom the king of
France immediately sent to Paris, to be placed in the charge of
his son Louis, and seized the cities, castles, and fortresses that
belonged to Arthur, and gave them in charge to keepers ap-
pointed by himself.

John, earl of Mortaigne, however, came to Le Mans, and
captured the castle and the city ; after which, he levelled the
walls of the city, the castle, and the houses in the city that
were built of stone, and made the citizens prisoners, because
they, against the fealty which they had sworn to himself, had
received Arthur as their lord. John, earl of Mortaigne, was
at Beaufort, in Anjou, on Easter day, which fell on the four-
teenth day before the calends of May. The said earl then
proceeded to Rouen, and, on the Lord's day, being the octave of
Easter, and the seventh day before the calends of May, and the
feast of Saint Mark the Evangelist, was girt with the sword

of the dukedom of Normandy, in the mother church of that
city, by the hand of "Walter, archbishop of Kouen ; on which
occasion, the before-named archbishop placed on the head of
the duke, a circlet of gold, having on the top thereof, around
the border, roses worked in gold. The duke made oath in the
presence of the clergy and the people, upon the relics of the
Saints and the Holy Evangelists, that he would preserve the
Holy Church and its dignities inviolate, with good faith and
without evil intent, and would exercise strict justice, and destroy
unjust laws, and establish good ones.

In the meantime, queen Eleanor, the mother of the
said duke, and Marchades, with his B/outiers, entered An-
jou, and ravaged it, because its people had received Ar-
thur. Hubert, archbishop of Canterbury, and William
Marshal, who had been sent to preserve the peace in
England, made the subjects of that kingdom, both in the
cities, as also the boroughs, and the earls, and barons, and
freholders, swear fealty, and to observe the peace towards John,
duke of the Normans, son of king Henry, the son of the em-
press Matilda, against all men. However, the whole of the
bishops, as well as such earls and barons as had castles,
strengthened the same with men, provisions, and arms. Upon
this, Hubert, archbishop of Canterbury, William Marshal, and
Geoffrey Fitz-Peter, justiciary of England, met at Northampton,
and summoning before them those persons of whom they had
the greatest doubts, namely, David, brotherof thekingof theScots,~~^i
Eichard, earl of Clare, Eanulph, earl of Chester, William, earl /
of Tewkesbury, Walran, earl of Warwick, Roger, constable of
Chester, William de Mowbray, and many others, earls as well
as barons, they pledged their word to them, that John, duke of
Normandy, would give to each of them his due, if they would
preserve their fealty to him, and keep the peace. Accordingly,
on these terms, the aforesaid earls and barons swore fealty and
faithful service to John, duke of Normandy, against all men.

William, king of the Scots, however, sent his envoys to
John, duke of Normandy, demanding restitution of his patri-
mony, namely, Northumberland and Cumberland, with their
appurtenances, on which he would swear fealty to him, and
faithfully serve him against all men. But the archbishop of
Canterbury, William Marshal, and Geoffrey Fitz-Peter, would
not allow the messengers of the king of Scotland to cross



458 ANNAiS OF HO'SEE BE HOYEDEN. A.D. 1199,

over to the duke ; but sent word to him by earl David, his
brother, that he must wait with patience until such time as the
duke should come into England. In like manner, John, duke
of Normandy, sent word to "\jJJiani,_king O f ^e g co t Sj by
Eustace de Yesci, his son-in-law, thatfon KFreturn " tolSgland,
he would satisfy him on all his demands, if in the meantime
he would keep the peace towards himself.

In the meantime, Master Honorius, who, through the royal
power and the malice of the dean and chapter of York, had
been deprived of the archdeaconry of Bichmond, which Geoffrey,
archbishop of York, had conferred on him, was received in the
said archdeaconry by the clergy of the said archdeaconry, who
swore to him fealty and canonical obedience, after expelling
the officers of Koger of Saint Edmund's, who had been intruded
by means of the royal power and the authority of the dean
and chapter of York. On the other hand, the dean and chapter
of York excommunicated the before-named Honorius and his
abettors for such presumptuous conduct ; on which the duke of
Normandy ordered that all the rights of the church of York
should remain in the same state in which they were on the day
on which his brother Richard, king of England, had been alive
and dead.

Shortly after, the said duke John crossed over from Normandy
into England, and landed at Scorham, 35 on the eighth day
before the calends of June, being the third day of the week,
and, on the next day, that is to say, on the vigil of the Ascen-
sion of our Lord, came to London, for the purpose of being
crowned on the following day.

Accordingly, upon the arrival of the before-named duke,
there assembled in London Hubert, archbishop of Canterbury,
John, archbishop of Dublin, the archbishop of Ragusa, William,
bishop of London, Gilbert, bishop of Rochester, John, bishop
of Norwich, Hugh, bishop of Lincoln, Eustace, bishop of Ely,
Godfrey, bishop of Winchester, Henry, bishop of Exeter, Sefrid,

Arundel, Eanulph, earl of Chester, and many barons. Hubert,
archbishop of Canterbury, crowned and consecrated the before-
named John, duke of Normandy, king of England, in the church
of Saint Peter the Apostle, at Westminster, on the sixth day
before the calends of June, being the fifth day of the week,
and the day of the Ascension of our Lord ; Philip, bishop of
Durham, protesting against the same, on the ground that the
coronation ought not to take place in the absence of Geoffrey,
archbishop of York, primate of all England.

On the day of his coronation, king John girded "William
Marshal with the sword of the earldom of Striguil, and Geof-
frey Fitz-Peter with the sword of the earldom of Essex ; which
parties, although they had been before styled earls, and had
had the management of their counties, had not been girded with
the swords of their earldoms ; and on the same day, being girded
with their swords, they served at the king's table.

On the day also of his coronation, the said king conferred
on Hubert, archbishop of Canterbury, his chancellorship. While
he was exulting in the power so conferred on him, and boast-
ing greatly of his favour with the king, Hugh Bardolph an-
swered him : " My lord, by your leave I say it, if you really
were well to consider the power of your name, and the dignity
of your position, you would not impose on yourself the yoke
of slavery ; for we have never seen or heard of a chancellor
being made out of an archbishop, but we have seen an arch-_
bishop made out of a chancellor."

' In the meantime, William, prior of May, "Walter, prior of
the Island of Saint Columba, and William de Haye, who had
been sent on behalf of William, king of Scotland, came to John,
king of England ; and, through them, the king of Scotland de-
manded of the king of England Northumberland and Cum-
berland, with their appurtenances, in right of inheritance from
his father. He also promised that if the king should restore
them to him, he would faithfully serve him with all his might ;
but if not, he would, if he possibly could, obtain the whole of his
rights. To this, king John made answer : "When your master,
the king of the Scots, my much-loved cousin, shall come to
me, I will do for him what is just, both in relation to this and
his other demands."

After this, John, king of England, sent Philip, bishop of
Durham, to meet the king of the Scots, hoping that he would
come at his command ; and he, in the meantime, came to Not-



460 AKJTALS OF ROGER DE HOVEDEX. A. D.I 199.

tingham, and remained there on the day of Pentecost, and
stayed in those parts, awaiting the arrival of the king of Scot-
land. However, the king of Scotland refused to come, but
sent again to the king of England, Eoger, bishop of Saint An-
drew's, and Hngh Malebise, whom the king of England had
sent for him, and demanded that the king of England should
restore to him Northumberland and Cumberland ; and if he
did not, he was to know for certain that, to the best of his
ability, he would gain possession of the same ; and for receiving
the king's answer on the subject, he appointed a truce of forty
days, while he himself, in the meantime, levied a large army.
On this, the bishop of Saint Andrew's, and Richard 36 Malebise,
followed the king of England as he was hastening towards
the sea-shore.

In the meanwhile, John, king of England, had delivered to
William de Stuteville Northumberland and Cumberland, with
the castles and earldoms thereof, to be held in his charge,
a charge which Hugh Bardolph had~ previously held. He also
gave in charge to Roger de Lascy, constable of Chester, his
castle of Pomfret, having first received from him his son and
heir as an hostage. The king next ordered Stephen de Turn-
ham, who had now for nearly two years held the archbishopric
of York in his charge, to deliver up the custody of the said
archbishopric to Master Ralph de Kime, William Ward,
and Roger de Bavent, on behalf of the archbishop ; on which,
the said Stephen wrote to the following effect to all his ser-
vants :

" Stephen de Turnham, to all his servants throughout the
manors of the lord archbishop of York, greeting. Our lord the
king has, by his letters, commanded me to deliver up the cus-
tody of the manors of the lord archbishop of York to Master
Ralph de Kime, William Ward, and, with them, Roger de
Bavent, on his behalf : and has ordered that the proceeds of
the manors are to be laid out in the cultivation of the lands,
and the repair of the boundaries Wherefore I do command
you, when the persons before-named, or their deputies, shall
come to you, to deliver up to them, without delay and diffi-
culty, the charge of the said manors. Farewell."

This was accordingly done : but t^e_ king, acting upon bad
advice, after the time of Pentecost, retained in his own hands
the rents of the manors ; making promise, that on the return

of the archbishop, he would pay them all to him. As for the
archbishop of Y~ork, after settling his affairs, as previously
stated, he had proceeded eight days' journey on his road home-
wards, when, hearing of the death of king Richard, he returned
to Rome, in order to make such alterations in his affairs as the
turn of events should require.

John, king of England, after settling his affairs in England,
crossed over from England to Normandy, and landed at Dieppe,
on the Lord's day, shortly before the feast of the Nativity of
Saint John the Baptist ; and on the day of the Nativity of
Saint John he was at Rouen, where a multitude of horse, and an
army of foot, came nocking in to him from every quarter; imme-
diately after which, a truce was agreed upon between him and
the king of France, until the day after the Assumption of Saint
Mary. On the very day of the conference. Geoffrey, archbishop
of York, having settled his affairs with our lord the pope to his
heart's content, returned into Normandy, and was honorably
and affectionately received by his brother John.

In the meantime, Philip, earl of Flanders, did homage to
John, king of England, at Rouen, on the sixth day of the
week before the Assumption of Saint Mary ; and the brother
of the said earl of Flanders voluntarily resigned into the hands
of Geoffrey, the archbishop of York, the prebend of Husthwaite,
which he had held in the church of York at the presentation of
Richard, king of England. The same was done by many others,
who felt that those presentations had been made against
God, and to the detriment of the Holy Church. Immediately
on this, the said archbishop gave to the before-mentioned bro-
ther of the earl of Flanders the prebend which had belonged to
Peter de Dinant, in the church of Saint Peter at York ; for
the said Peter had, before this, been elected to the bishopric of
Rennes, in Brittany ; the archbishop also ordered the arch-
deaconry of West Riding, which he had held in the church of
York, to be taken possession of in his behalf : but Adam de
Tornouere, who at this time held possession of the said arch-
deaconry, declined to trust him, relying on the king's patron-
age and the authority of the chapter of York.

In the meantime, Jlenry, count de Namur, brother of Philip,
earl of Flanders, and Peter de Douay, a most valiant knight,
and one of theTEousehold of the earl of Flanders, and the bishop
elect of Cambray, brother of the before-named Peter, were
made prisoners by some of the household of the king of France,



462 ANNALS OF ROGEB DE HOYEDEN. A.D. 1199.

and delivered up to him. On this, Peter de Capua, car-
dinal, and legate of the Apostolic See in France, upon his
arrival, laid an interdict upon France, for the capture of
the said bishop elect of Cambray, . and upon Normandy, for
the captivity of Philip, bishop of Beauvais : and, before the
said sentence was revoked, Philip, king of France, set the
before-named bishop elect at liberty, and John, king of Eng-
land, gave his liberty to Philip, bishop of Beauvais, after he
had paid two thousand marks of silver for the expenses in-
curred upon him and through him in the time of Eichard, king
of England, and since the death of king Eichard up to the day
of his liberation. The said bishop of Beauvais also made oath,
in presence of the before-named cardinal and other eccle-
siastics, that for the future he would never, in all his life, bear
arms against Christians.

Philip, king of France [at this time], made Arthur, duke of
Brittany, a knight, and received his homage for Anjou, Poitou,
Maine, Touraine, Brittany, and Normandy. On the day after
the Assumption of Saint Mary, and the following day, there was
a conference held between the king of England and the king
of France, through their envoys, at a place between Buttevant
and Guleton, and on the third day after, the kings had an in-
terview in person. However, the king of England found no
favour with the king of France ; and, on the king of France
being asked why he held John, king of England, in such great
hatred, who had never done him any injury, he made answer,
that he had, without his permission, taken possession of Nor-
mandy and other territories ; and that he ought first to have come
to him, and to have asked them of him as of his right, and to have
done homage to him for the same. At this interview also, the
king of France demanded, on his own behalf, the whole of
the Yexin, that is to say, the whole of the country that lies
between the forest of Lyons, the Seine, the river Andely, and
the river Ethe. For he asserted that Geoffrey, earl of Anjou,
the father of king Henry, son of the empress Matilda, had
given the same to Louis the Fat, the king of the Franks, in
return for his assistance in gaining Normandy, against Stephen,
king of England. He also demanded, on behalf of Arthur,
Poitou, Anjou, Maine, and Touraine, and made other requests
to which the king of England would on no account accede,
nor ought he so to have done ; and so disagreeing, they sepa-
rated.



A.D. 1199. THE KING OF FBANCE BESIEGES LAVABDItf. 463

Upon this, the counts and barons of the kingdom of France
who had adhered to Eichard, king of England, came to John,
king of England, and did homage to king John, and made oath
to him that they would not make terms with the king of
France, unless with his sanction and consent ; and he swore to
them that he would make no treaty with the king of France,
unless they were included therein.

In the meantime, pope Innocent and the Romans elected as
their emperor, Otho, king of Germany, and rejected Philip,
duke of Suabia, and all the others who had been selected.
Accordingly, the election of the said Otho being confirmed by
pope Innocent and the Roman Church, pope Innocent proceeded
to excommunicate Philip, duke of Suabia, and all his adherents,
advisers, and abettors, if they should not desist from their
attacks upon the said Otho ; who was publicly proclaimed in
the Capitol and throughout the whole of the city, in the words,
"Long live our emperor Otho!" Accordingly, being elected
emperor, Otho sent word to John, king of England, his uncle,
to wait a little time, and defer making peace with Philip, king
of France, as he himself, God willing, would, before long, give
him the very best aid that his imperial highness could possibly
give him.

In the meantime, Philip, king of France, took Conches, the
castle of Roger de Toni ; this happened in the month of Sep-
tember.

In the same month of September, Joanna, wife of Raymond,
earl of Saint Gilles, the former queen of Sicily, and sister of
John, king of England, departed this life, at Rouen, in Nor-
mandy ; and, being carried to the abbey of Fontevraud, was
there interred among the nuns.

In the month of October the king of France took the castle
of Balun, of which Geoffrey de Burelim had charge, and le-
velled it with the ground. When "William des Roches, the
leader of Arthur's army, knew of this, he was greatly vexed,
and strongly censured the king of France, saying that it had not
been so arranged between him and his lord Arthur ; to which
the king of France made answer, that for his lord Arthur
he should not forbear doing just as he pleased with reference
to his gains from the enemy.

After this, the king of France laid siege to Lavardin, but
the king of England surprised him with his army, and the king
of France, abandoning the siege, betook himself to the city of



464 ANJTALS OF BOGER DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1199.

Le Mans. However, on the king of England pursuing him
with his army, the king of France left Le Mans, and took his
departure. In the meantime, "William des Koches, by means of
extreme cunning, recovered Arthur from the hands of the king
of France, and made peace between him and John, king of
England, to whom he delivered the city of Le Mans, which the
king of France and Arthur had delivered into his charge.

On the same day, Arthur was informed that the king of
England intended to take him and throw him into prison. On
this day also, the viscount de Tuaz, 36 who had charge of the
castle of Chinon, came to the king of England, at his summons,
at Le Mans, and, being forced so to do, surrendered to the king
the castle of Chinon, and the seneschalship of Anjou ; on which
the king of England 37 immediately delivered the castle of Chi-
non into the charge of Roger, constable of Chester, until such
time as the king should have found another custodian for the
same.

On the following night, however, Arthur, and his mother,
and the said viscount de Tuaz, with many others, left the king
of England and took their departure, and withdrew to the city
of Anjou. For the mother of Arthur, having left her husband,
Ranulph, earl of Chester, had married Guido de Tuaz, the
brother of the before-named viscount de Tuaz.

On the sixth day before the ides of July, in this year, died
Hugh, bishop elect of the church of Glasgow, and was buried
at Geddewerde. 38 In the month of October, in the same year,
William Malvoisin was elected bishop of the church of Glasgow.

In the meantime, Peter de Capua, cardinal, and legate of the
Apostolic^ See, who had been sent by Innocent, the Supreme
Pontiff, for the purpose of putting an end to the dissensions
between Richard, king of England; and Philip, king of France,
and at whose instance the said kings had promised that they
would observe a truce for the space of five years, now that
the said truce had failed, in consequence of the death of Richard,
king of England, used every possible effort that the said truce
should be observed between the king of France before named,
and John, king of England, the heir of the before-named
Richard. The consequence was, that a truce was agreed to.
between them until the feast of Saint Hilary. In the san*J|
year, Philip, bastard son of Richard, king of England, to whom

the said king, his father, had given the castle and the manor
of Cuinac, 39 slew the before-named viscount of Limoges, in re-
venge for his father.

In the same year, there were in England, and the various
parts thereof, such vast floods of water that bridges, mills,
and houses, were carried away. The bridge of Berwick having
been carried away, by command of William, king of the Scots,
earl Patrick, the governor of Berwick, and the then chief justi-
ciary of the whole kingdom of Scotland, attempted to rebuild
the bridge ; on which he was forbidden, on behalf of Philip,
bishop of Durham, to sink a foundation for a bridge on his land ;
but the bridge could not be made unless it had its foundation on
the land of the bishop of Durham, -as it had before. At length,
however, the bishop of Durham, by the advice of William de
Stuteville, allowed the bridge to be made, and to have its
foundation on his own land, saving always the covenants that
had been made between the king of Scotland and Hugh, bishop
of Durham, his predecessor.

In the same year, Geoffrey, the archbishop of York, Simon,
the dean, Haimo, the treasurer, Reginald, the precentor, Adam
de Tornouere, and William Testard, the archdeacons, and the
other canons of the church of York, having met in the presence
of Peter de Capua, cardinal deacon and titular of Saint Mary
de Via Lata, and legate of the Apostolic See, Geoffrey, arch-
bishop of York, and the above-named clergy of the church of
York, submitted the decision of their disputes to Hugh, the
lord bishop of Lincoln, Master Eoger, dean of the said church,
and Master Columba; on which occasion, the archbishop pro-
mised, on the word of truth, that if he should refuse to abide
by the decision of the before-named arbitrators, he would pay
to the dean and canons of York two hundred marks by way of
penalty ; the dean also, and the before-named clergy of the
church of York, made oath distinctly that they would not re-
fuse to abide by the decision of the before-named arbitrators,
but would dutifully receive and dutifully observe whatever
should be determined by them.

After this, when the officers of the archbishop of York, on va-
rious grounds, attempted, by the pope's letters, to summon them
to trial before other judges, they made claim against the arch-
bishop of the said two hundred marks of silver, by way of
penalty. Also, while the said archbishop was staying with the

king in Normandy, Hubert, archbishop of Canterbury, and
Geoffrey Fitz-Peter, the king's justiciary, at the entreaties, and
in behalf of, the chapter of York, sent word to the king and
advised him not to allow the archbishop of York to return to
England without him, for, they declared, if he should come into
England, he would be bringing a sword, and not peace.

Some Statutes enacted ly Iting John.

In the same year, John, king of England, enacted that no
wine of Poitou should be sold at a higher rate than twenty
shillings the tun, and that no wine of Anjou should be sold
V at a higher rate than twenty-four shillings the tun, and that
$ no French wine should be sold at a higher rate than twenty-
five shillings the tun ; unless the said wine was so good
that any one would be willing to give for it as much as
two marks at the highest. He also enacted, that no wine of
Poitou should be sold at a higher rate than fourpence the gallon ;
and that no white wine should be sold at a higher rate than
, sixpence the gallon. He also enacted, that all the tuns which
should in future come into England from Rech, 40 after the
present vintage, should be changed. This statute he ordered
to be observed from the octave of Saint Andrew in De-
cember and thenceforward ; and, for the observance thereof,
ordered that in every city and borough in which wine is sold
twelve inspectors should be appointed, and should make oath
that they would cause the said assize to be kept and observed.
And, if they should find any vintner selling wine at the tap
contrary to the said assize, the sheriff was to arrest his body,
and have him kept in safe custody in the prison of our lord
the king, until he should have some other command relative to
him, and all his goods were to be seized on behalf of our lord
the king, on view of the said twelve men. If any one was also
found who should buy or sell a tun or tuns contrary to the said
assize, both parties were to be seized, and placed in safe custody
in prison, until some other command should be received rela-
tive to them; and it was enacted, that no wine should be bought
for regrating, out of the wines that should have been landed in
England.

However, this first ordinance of the king had hardly been
enacted, when it was immediately done away with ; as the
merchants could not bear up against this assize. Accordingly,
40 Rochelle.

leave was given them to sell a gallon of white wine for eight-
pence, and a gallon of red wine for sixpence ; and so the land
was filled with drink and drinkers.

In the same year, when William, king of the Scots, was
purposing to invade England with an army, he went to the
shrine of Saint Margaret, the former queen of the Scots, at
Dunfermline, and passed the night there; on which, being
warned by a Divine admonition not to invade England with an
army, he allowed his army to return to their homes.

In the same year was decided that most ancient dispute
between the churches of Tours and Dol, as to the metropolitan
rights which the church of Dol claimed against the church of
Tours, in the following manner : Our lord the pope Celestinus,
of blessed memory, had determined that, with the Lord's as-
sistance, in his time an end should be put to this most ancient
and most lamentable dispute, which had been carried on be-
tween the churches of Tours and Dol. Accordingly, for this
purpose he had appointed to each party a peremptory day, on
which, being sufficiently provided with all their reasons which
they might consider that they should be in want of at the
trial, all appeals, delays, and excuses laid aside, they were to
appear in the Apostolic presence. But, inasmuch as it was
not granted from above that the above-mentioned question
should be settled by him (for he was removed from the world
before the appointed time had arrived), our lord the pope In-
nocent, formerly Lothaire, cardinal deacon of Saints Sergius
and Bachus, on succeeding the said lord Celestinus, adopting
the commencement that had been made by his predecessor
relative to the above-mentioned question by the citation of the
parties, and wishing by a discussion on the matter, with the
help of the Lord, entirely to put an end thereto, for the same
reason, gave orders that the parties should repair to the E-oman
Church, in order that the said matter might be brought to an
end by him, if, perchance, Divine Providence should spare
him.

Because the archbishop of Tours at this time was labouring
under very great infirmity in all his body, he did not appear
in person in presence of the Supreme Pontiff' ; however, he took
care to send discreet and prudent men in his place, namely, the
chancellor of his church and three of his fellow-canons, together
with some other persons. Accordingly, the bishop of Dol elect, and
the before-named commissioners of the said archbishop, having



468 ANNALS OF EOGEB DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1199.

come into the presence of the Supreme Pontiff and the cardinals,
his brethren, and many things having been alleged on the one
side and the other, in defence of their rights, the said lord In-
nocent began, like a most kind father, as also did his brethren,
to attempt to effect a reconciliation between them ; and in order
that they might have time to deliberate, he put off the further
hearing of either party at intervals.

Although the commissioners from Tours were at last induced
to make an offer to concede an archiepiscopal see to the church
of Dol, with two suffragans only, and on condition that it should
be subject to the lord archbishop of Tours as its prince, and that
the archbishop of Dol should receive from his hand, or that of
the church of Tours, the pall that was sent to the said church
of Tours from the pope, as also consecration; still, because
two of the adjacent bishoprics were refused by the envoys of
the archbishop of Tours to the said bishop elect of Dol, he
would on no account accept of their said offer ; a refusal in-
deed, which redounded to his own inconvenience, as will be
heard in the sequel.

Accordingly, the pope, seeing that the said dispute could not
be settled on amicable terms, listened to the citations and alle-
gations made on either side in full consistory, more freely and
fully than before. After hearing and understanding them
more fully, he was ready at length, with his brethren, to
pronounce a definite sentence. But, once more seeking the
ways of peace, he invited them to make an arrangement.

When, however, he could at length avail nothing whatever
by these means, the lord Innocent, sitting in judgment, his
brethren acting as his assessors, publicly pronounced sentence,
in the second year of his papacy, against the church of Dol,
and in favour of the church of Tours, to the effect that the
church of Dol, as being the suffragan of the church of Tours, its
metropolitan, should, all exemption or exception laid aside,
for the future be subject thereto; that the bishop of Dol should
in all things pay obedience and respect to the archbishop of
Tours ; that when he was elected, he should receive confirma-
tion, and, when the proper time required it, consecration from
him ; and, in addition to this, he granted a general privilege to
the church of Tours, illustrated with manifold arguments and
reasons for the same, and sent to the archbishop of Kouen, and
some other persons, his Apostolic writings relative to the said
subject, all of which will appear more fully from what follows.



A.D. 1199. THE CHUBCH OF DOL DEPRIVED OF THE PALL. 469

But when the bishop elect of Dol heard that sentence was
pronounced against him, being vexed, and not without reason,
and very dispirited, he came into the presence of our lord the
pope, and, wishing to depose himself, resigned to our lord the
pope the church of Dol. But our lord the pope, on seeing this,
answered without hesitation, " Thou art the bridegroom, and
the bride requireth thee. Thou canst not do that which is
against our will, without our own consent ; and, in virtue of thy
obedience, we enjoin thee, after summons made by the arch-
bishop of Tours, to repair to him within the space of forty days,
all excuse whatever laid aside, for the purpose of receiving
from him the gift of consecration."

In the same year, master Giraldus, 41 the bishop elect of Saint
David's, raised a controversy as to the metropolitan right over
the church of Saint David's, publicly asserting the right of the
said church and its ancient metropolitan dignity, in presence
of our lord the pope Innocent the Third, and the cardinals,
namely, Octavianus, cardinal of Ostia, the cardinal of Por-
tuenza, John, cardinal bishop of Albano, Jordan de Fossa Nova,
Sephred, John de Saint Paul, John de Salerno, Gratianus,
Ugolino, and Hugeson. 42

It ought to be known that after Saint Dubricius, the arch-
bishop of the city of Chester, choosing the life of a recluse, had
resigned the honor of his dignity to Saint David, the latter
forthwith transferred the archiepiscopal dignity to Menevia, 43 and
was made archbishop of that province ; and, in succession to
him, twenty-four persons received the pall and the full metro-
politan dignity, the last of whom was Saint Samson, who, on ac-
count of the jaundice, which pestilence was committing fatal
ravages amongst the people of Wales at that time, crossed over by
ship to Armorican Brittany, and was appointed over the church
of Dol, which then chanced to be vacant, and there made use of
the pall of Saint David, which he had brought over with him.

On this pretext it was, that the church of Dol, by continually
laying claim to the pall, had shown itself rebellious to the church
of Tours, down to the time of the before-named pope Innocent
the Third, in whose second year this cause was decided, and
this adventitious dignity was withdrawn from the church of
Dol.

470 AJfNALS OF EOGEE DE HOVEDEtf. A.D. 1199.

As for the church of Saint David's, from the same cause,
either through slothfulness or poverty, its bishops had always
hitherto gone without the pall. Still, however, all the bishops
of the church of Saint David's, that is to say, nineteen bishops,
from the departure of Saint Samson until the time of Henry,
the first king of England, enjoyed the whole of the archiepis-
copal dignity, except the pall, and had seven suffragans,
namely, Llandaff, Saint Paternus in Kerdikan, 44 (which see,
because the people thereof slew their pastor, had been long since
abolished, and united with the diocese of Saint David's), Bangor
and Saint Asaph ; while in Wales, beyond the Severn, which
had been lately taken possession of by the English, there were
the bishoprics of Chester, Hereford, and Worcester.

However, the before-named king Henry, having rendered
"Wales subject to his rule, and, consequently, wishing to ren-
der the said church of Saint David's, and the other churches
in Wales, suffragans of the church of Saint David's, subject to
the church of his own kingdom, namely, to the church of Can-
terbury, had Bernard, the clerk of his chamber, appointed in
place of bishop Wilfrid, in the church of Saint David's, and
then, by violent measures, had him consecrated at Canterbury ;
he being the first bishop of the church of Saint David's who
was consecrated by the archbishop of Canterbury. After him,
David and Peter were in like manner compelled by the kings
of England to receive consecration from the archbishops of
Canterbury, oaths having been previously extorted from them,
in contravention of the canons, not at any time to raise any
dispute as to their metropolitan right against the church of
Canterbury.

Bernard, however, on the decease of king Henry the First,
did move the question, as to the metropolitan rights of his
church, against Theobald, archbishop of Canterbury ; on which
occasion, pope Eugenius wrote to Theobald, archbishop of Can-
terbury, to the following effect :

The Letter of pope Eugenius, on the metropolitan dignity of tlte
church of Saint David's.

ther, Bernard, bishop of Saint David's, coming into our pre-

sence, has asserted that the church of Saint David's was for-
merly metropolitan, and has personally demanded restitution
to be made by us of the said dignity. When, however, watch-
ing over the interests of his said application, he had made a long
stay at our court, you, brother archbishop, in his presence,
rising to oppose him, did, in our presence, make complaint
against him, that he had withdrawn the obedience due to you
as the chief metropolitan, and had shown himself disobedient
and rebellious towards you, inasmuch as he had been consecrated
by your predecessor, as being chief metropolitan, and had, both
personally and in writing, made profession to the church of
Canterbury, and had afterwards, like the other suffragans, shown
obedience to you in many matters, and waited upon you. On
this, he could not deny the fact of consecration, but utterly
denied that he had made the profession, and had shown
obedience ; hearing which, you publicly produced two wit-
nesses, who gave testimony that in their seeing and hearing,
after his consecration, both in words and writing, he had
made profession to the see of Canterbury. Accordingly, after
hearing the reasons of both parties, and diligently weighing
the same, and having carefully examined your witnesses, witli
the general sanction of our brethren, we received their depo-
sitions upon oath, and, justice so dictating, commanded that the
said bishop should show to you, as chief metropolitan, all obe-
dience and respect/ "Wherefore, inasmuch as it is our wish
to preserve for each church, and for ecclesiastical personages,
their own dignities and what is their respective due, we have
named a day for you and for him, the Feast of Saint Luke in
the year nexf ensuing, upon which, in the presence of all the
parties, we may learn the truth as to the dignity of the church
of Saint David's and its liberties; and we will then decree rela-
tive thereto, by the Lord's help, what shall be found to be
conformable with justice. Given at Meaux, on the third day
before the calends of July."

Now this letter, the before-named Master Giraldus found in
the register of pope Eugenius : and accordingly, on these grounds,
and at the instance of the said Giraldus, who publicly asserted
the rights of his church in the court of Borne, pope Innocent,
by his letters, cited Hubert, archbishop of Canterbury, as to
the state of the church of Saint David's and the metropolitan
dignity ; which letters the said Giraldus also caused to be en-
tered in the register of that pope, as a perpetual testimony of



472 ASTffALS OF BOGER DE HOVEDEX. A.D. 1200.

what had been done. The said pope also gave orders to the
before-named archbishop, so to give consecration to the said
Giraldus, the bishop elect of Saint David's, as not to exact
from him the unlawful oath which his predecessors had been
in the habit of extorting from the bishop of Saint David's,
namely, as to not asserting their metropolitan rights against
the church of Canterbury, but solely canonical obedience ac-
ording to the usual form. The said pope also commanded
the bishops of Lincoln, Durham, and Ely, if the archbishop of
Canterbury should delay to consecrate Giraldus, so often named,
that they, supported therein by the Apostolic authority, should
not delay to consecrate him themselves.

In the year of grace 1200, which was the second year of
the reign of king JoKn, thaiTking was at Burun, in Normandy,
iW Pithe_day_Qf_the ^ajivity_^.l_our Lord, which fell on Satur-
day ; and this was the first Feast of the Nativity of our Lord
after the first coronation of king John. After the Nativity of
our Lord, the said John, king of England, and Philip, king of
France,' met to hold a conference between Andely and Gaillon ;
at which interview, it was agreed between them, that Louis,
son of the king of France, should take to wife the daughter of
Alphonso, king of Castille, and niece of John, king of Eng-
land ; on which, king John would give and quitclaim to the
said son of the king of France, together with his said niece, the
city of Evreux, together with the whole county thereof, and
all the fortresses and castles which the king of France had in
Normandy, on the day on which Richard, king of England,
was living and dead ; besides which, he was to give him thirty
thousand marks of silver. He also made oath, that he would
^givje_no_aid_to his nephew 0th o, either in money or in men, for
the purpose^ of gaining tEe Roman empire.

All these matters, however, were put off until the octave of
the Nativity of Saint John the Baptist. After the conference,
John, king of England, sent his mother, Eleanor, to Alphonso,
king of Castille, to obtain his daughter in marriage for Louis,
son of Philip, king of France.

Jin the meantime, John, king of England, crossed over
from Normandy into England, and levied from each carucatc
throughout all England the sum of three shillings as an aid.
"St'Xcnt, king John came to York, expecting that William,
king of the Scots, would come to him, as he had commanded



A.D. 1200. LETTER OF POPE INNOCENT. 473

him ; the king of the Scots, however, did not come ; on which,
the king of England returned to Normandy.

In the same year, pope Innocent, on hearing of the tribu-
lations of the Christians in the land of Jerusalem, which the
Lord had brought upon them, our sins demanding the same,
wrote to all the prelates of Holy Mother Church, to the fol-
lowing effect :

TJie Letter of pope Innocent on giving succour to the land of
Jerusulem.

" Innocent, the bishop, servant of the servants of God, to all
the prelates of the Holy Mother Church to whom these letters
shall come, health and the Apostolic benediction. The sad
miseries of the lands of the East, and their urgent necessities,
we now are, our sins demanding the same, compelled to lament
rather than recount ; inasmuch as it is a matter of necessity
that succour should be given thereto, in their present state, (if
state, indeed, the train of calamities can be called, which with
grief we recite), and that resistance should be offered to the
attempts of the pagans. It may, indeed, be supposed, that but
few of the Christians who had devoted themselves to the defence
of the inheritance of the Lord, and to obedience to Him cruci-
fied, will make drunk the arrows of the enemy with the shed-
ding of their blood, and expose their throats to the swords
of the pagans, inasmuch, as by this, nearly all the pilgrims
have returned from those parts, as so many remnants of the
desolation of that land, to be totally lost without any hope
of human aid, and to fall into the possession of the foe.
Hitherto, indeed, our Lord Jesus Christ, to the end that He
might the more strongly prove our faith, and might find who are
His own, has, in His mercy, prevented this, by turning their
hands against themselves, and allowing them, in their various
dissensions, to vent their rage upon each other, in order that,
in the meantime, the Christians being aroused to the aid oi the
said land, a more easy means might be granted them of reco-
vering what was lost, and of triumphing over the foe. For we
have received letters from our venerable brethren, the Patriarchs
of Jerusalem and Antioch, and from the archbishops and bishops
of both provinces, as also, in like manner, from our most dearly
beloved sons in Christ, Aimeric, king of Jerusalem, and Leo,
king of Armenia, and our own dearly beloved sons, the Masters
of the Hospital and of the knights of the Temple, and many



474 ANNALS OF BOGEE DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1200.

others, fully explaining the miseries and necessities of that
land, and asking for the aid that was so long looked for.; for
that there, strong hopes were entertained, the Lord so disposing,
that at the present time a few would be of more avail, in con-
sequence of the dissensions among the Saracens, than hitherto
a numerous army had been. It was also added, that, as arrange-
ments were being made among the Saracens for the establishment
of peace, if a full reconciliation should be effected among them
before assistance should be given to the province of Jerusalem, in-
asmuch as it is almost entirely destitute of men and resources,
unless God alone should interpose, there would be no one able
to withstand their violent attacks. Wherefore we, with our
brethren, summoning also the bishops and other religious men
who were then staying at the Apostolic See, after considering
the mode of succouring that land, in order that we might not
seem to be laying heavy burdens on the shoulders of those who
bore them, and not to be willing to touch the same even with
our finger, talking only, and, as the saying is, doing little or
nothing, in order that an example might be set by ourselves to
you, and then by you to the laity, in doing good, after the ex-
ample of Him who began to do and to teach [at the same
time], made it our care to_^e^_ajide_Jhe^^th_^a ! rLof _all_our
revenu,e_s, and of all our receipts, for the assistance of the Eastern
lands, withdrawing not the slightest portion therefrom for our
necessities, to which indeed, inasmuch as they are more pressing
than usual, and on that account demand a more heavy expen-
diture, our present means do not suffice ; to the end that, although
we were giving nothing of our own, we might, at least, repay
to Him a small portion of what is His, who, in His mercy,
has bestowed all things upon us. And not only in resources,
but also in personal attendance, did we make it our anxious
endeavour to provide the requisite aid for the Holy Land ; for
we determined to dispatch thither our dearly beloved sons,
Stephen, cardinal priest and titular of Saint Praxedes, and
Peter, cardinal deacon and titular of Saint Mary in Vid Lata,
as legates of the Apostolic See, on whom we had already placed
the sign of the Cross, in order that they might act in our behalf
in preceding the army of the Lord, and that, to them, as to a
single head, all might resort. But, inasmuch as we look upon
this as slight, aye, slight indeed, and as by no means sufficing
to the necessities so numerous of that land, we do, by these
Apostolic writings, command the whole of you, and I, in be-



A.D. 1200. LETTER OF POPE nOTOCEJfT. 475

half of Almighty God, do, by the guidance of the Holy
Spirit, under pain of God's judgment, strictly command, that
each of you shall appropriate the fortieth part of all ecclesias-
ticaTje venues and profits, (interest, however, being first de-
ducted therefrom, of which payment cannot be avoided), for
the aid of the Holy Land. To all clerks, subordinates as well
as prelates, who shall spontaneously and faithfully pay such
fortieth part, trusting in the mercy of Almighty God, and in
the authority of the blessed Apostles, Saint Peter and Saint
Paul, we do remit one fourth part of the penance that has been
enjoined them, supposing always, that no fraud is made use of,
and that pious devotion is supported thereby. For know,
that he is acting culpably and obdurately, and shows himself
obdurately culpable, who refuses to give so small an aid, in
such an emergent necessity, to his Creator and Redeemer,
from whom he has received his body and his soul, and all the
blessings that he enjoys ; and we, who, unworthy as we are,
act as His vicar upon earth, can on no account conceal the obdu-
racy of such an offence. And you must not by any means sup-
pose that, by these means, it is our wish to establish a law at
the expense of yourselves, in order that, in future, the fortieth
part may be required of you, as due and customary ; for, on
the contrary, we w r ish nothing whatever to result herefrom
to your prejudice, as we grieve that a case of such great
necessity has occurred to us and to you, and it is our wish
that, in future, the like may not occur. We do further
will, and by this our precept command you, that you, brother
archbishops and bishops, shall make it your care, without
delay, to meet in your metropolitan church, or, if it cannot
be done there, "by reason of disagreements or any other evident
impediment, in two or three other places of your province,
and there consider among yourselves, according to the tenor of
the Apostolic mandate, the succour of that land ; and, after
each of you shall have returned into his diocese, he is to con-
vene a synod without delay, and there, relying upon our
authority, enjoin the abbats and priors, both exempt 43 as
well as others, as also the archdeacons, deans, and all others
whatsoever of the clergy throughout his diocese, appointed by
a fair assessment to tax their revenues and profits, and within
three months after the command so given to them, not to delay
to send to some fitting place in his diocese the fortieth part of
43 Exempt from the episcopal government.

the value thereof; employing, nevertheless, for the sake of
greater precaution, the services of some faithful and discreet
laymen therein : which, also, brother archbishops and bishops,
we do strictly command you to do. From these general terms,
however, we have excepted the Cistercian monks, the Praemon-
stratensian canons, and the recluses of Grammont and Can-
terbury, to whom we give, relative to this matter, especial com-
mands. "We are also unwilling that those who have taken
diligent care to value their revenues and profits shall incur the
penalty of transgressing the strict injunctions above given;
but those who shall not of their certain knowledge, but rather
through ignorance, have subtracted from their fortieth part,
shall still, when they shall have afterwards found it out, fully
make up for the deficiency they have so made in their pay-
ment. If, also, which God forbid, any person shall withdraw,
of his own certain knowledge, any portion of the fortieth part
so to be paid, the same person, when he shall have made due
satisfaction, shall be entirely free from any penalty for such
transgression. And let not any one be surprised, or even won-
der, that we order this with such strictness, inasmuch as it is
an extreme necessity that demands it. For, although obedience
to the Divine will ought to be a pleasure, we still read in the
Gospel .that, of those invited to the marriage feast, the Lord
gave orders that they should be compelled to go in to the same.
"We do further command that you, brother archbishops and
bishops, after exacting and collecting the said fortieth part
throughout your dioceses, shall faithfully cause the same, ac-
cording to the manner above stated, to be deposited in a place
of safety, and shall, so soon as can possibly be done, signify
unto us, by your letters, and through special messengers,
the amount of the whole thereof. For this purpose, we do
order that a hollow chest shall be placed in each of your
churches, fastened with three keys; the first to be in the hands
of the bishop, the second with the priest of the church, and
the third with some pious layman, by them to be kept ; and
each of the faithful is to be moved to deposit therein alms for
the remission of their sins, according as the Lord shall have
inspired their minds in relation thereto ; and in all churches
mass shall be publicly said once a week for the remission of sins,
and especially of those who shall make offerings. We do
also grant unto you, brother archbishops and bishops, that,
in relation to those who shall be willing with their property



A.D. 1200. LETTEB, OF POPE INNOCENT. 477

to aid the Holy Land, after, using therein the counsels of dis-
creet men, you shall have duly considered the rank of such
persons and their means, and shall have taken into considera-
tion the intensity of their devotion, you shall have power to
change works of penance that have been enjoined for works
of almsgiving. We do further will, that, joining with you two
brethren, where the same can be found, one of the Hospital of
Jerusalem and the other one of the Knights of the Temple, as
also other religious laymen, you shall provide for discreet
knights, or other soldiers, who have assumed the sign of the
Cross of our Lord, if they shall be unable to make the voyage
at their own expense, a suitable supply out of the said sum,
having taken from them a sufficient security that they will
remain in defence of the Eastern lands one year or more, ac-
cording to the amount of the assistance they shall have re-
ceived ; and that if, which God forbid, they shall die on the
way, they will not apply the amount so received to other uses,
but will, on the contrary, restore it, to be applied in payment
of the troops ; and such persons, when they shall have returned,
shall not be discharged from the sureties which they have given,
before they shall have presented to you letters from the king, or
Patriarch, or Hospital of Jerusalem, or order of the Temple, or
else from our legate, giving full testimony to the fact of their
attendance there. But, inasmuch as supreme necessity demands,
and common utility requires, that the people of Christendom
should, not only in resources, but in person, render aid to the Holy
Land without delay against the attacks of the pagans, we do by
these Apostolic writings inform your brotherhood, forthwith,
prudently and diligently to make it your care to exhort and in-
duce the faithful, both of yourselves and by means of other fit-
ting persons, to the end that those who are capable of fighting the
battles of the Lord, may, in the name of the Lord of Sabaoth,
assume the sign of the Cross. Let the rest also, according to the
extent of their means, bestow their pious alms. We also our-
selves, trusting in the mercy of God, and in the authority of
the blessed Apostles, Saint Peter and Saint Paul, by virtue of
that power which, unworthy as we are, God has bestowed upon
us, of binding and loosing, do indulgently grant to all who shall
in their own person undergo the labours of this expedition, and
incur the expense thereof, plenary pardon for those sins, for
which they shall have shown repentance both with voice and

heart, and promise them the blessings of eternal salvation as
the reward of the just. To those also who shall not personally
go thither, hut who shall at their own expense have'sent thither
lit and proper men to stay there for one year at least, as also
to those who, at the expense of others, hut in their own per-
sons, shall have undergone the labours of the pilgrimage so
undertaken, we do grant plenary pardon for their sins. Of this
remission also, we do will that all shall be partakers according
to the amount of their aid and the intensity of their devotion,
who shall give suitable aid out of their resources in support of
the said land. Their own persons also, and their property,
from the time of their assuming the Cross, we do take under
the protection of Saint Peter and of ourselves, and they are to
be under the care of the archbishops and all prelates of the
church of God ; it being by us enacted, that until the fact of
their death or their return is known to a certainty, the same
shall remain safe and untouched. And if any person shall
presume to act contrary hereto, he is to be compelled by eccle-
siastical censure, all power of appeal removed. If also any
persons among those proceeding thither shall be bound by
oath to the payment of interest, then do you, brother arch-
bishops and bishops, by the same means of coercion, compel
their creditors throughout your dioceses, all obstacle by appeal
removed, entirely to absolve them from their oaths, and to make
them desist from any further exaction of interest. But if any
creditor shall compel them to payment of interest, you are, by
like measures of coercion, to force him to make restitution
thereof, all power of appeal removed. We do also order that
Jews shall be compelled by the secular power to remit all claim
against such for interest, and, until they shall have remitted
the same, we do order that, through sentence of excommunica-
tion, all communication whatever with them shall be withheld.
These matters also, brother archbishops and bishops, we do wish
and command each of you to carry out in his respective diocese;
and you are so diligently and so faithfully to follow the same,
that in the strict enquiry made at the last judgment, when you
shall be standing before the judgment seat of Christ, you shall
be enabled to give a becoming account thereof. Given at the
Lateran, on the sixth day before the calends of January, in the
second year of our pontificate.' 7

In the same month of January, immediately after the Na-
tivity of our Lord, the heart of Philip, king of France, being



A.D. 1200. TRUCE OF THE K1XGS OF CASTILLE AND ARRAGOtf. 479

hardened, he could be prevailed upon neither by kind nor by
harsh measures, to get rid of his adulteress, and take once more
his lawful wife : on which, Peter de Capua, the before-named car-
dinal and legate of the Apostolic See. jDnmounced sentence of
interdict on the kingdom of Prance, and took his departure,
commanding the clergy, in virtue of their obedience, to allow
no Divine service to be performed, except baptism and confes-
sion ; but pope Innocent, on confirming this sentence, excepted
therefrom all who had assumed or should assume the Cross of
the pilgrimage to Jerusalem, enacting that they might hear
mass, and have Christian burial, while all others were to go
without the mass and Christian burial.

When, however, the king of France remained immoveable
in his evil purposes, our lord the pope proposed to revoke the
sentence of interdict, and to excommunicate the king of France,
saying, " It is better that one should be punished, than that
the whole nation should perish." 46 On hearing this, the king
of France repeatedly sent envoys to the Supreme Pontiff, re-
questing that the sentence of interdict might be revoked ; and,
although he suffered a repulse a first and second time, still, at
last, it was definitely arranged by our lord the pope, envoys
from the king of France acting in his behalf in presence of our
lord the pope and the cardinals, that the king of France should
put away his adulteress, and take again his wife Botilda, and
treat her honorably as a queen and as his wife ; and if during
the next year the king of France should wish a divorce to be
effected between them, the same should be signified to the
king of Denmark and the other friends of the queen, when
and where the king of France should desire the said divorce
to be effected, if the same ought of right to be effected, in order
that the queen's friends might be able to attend; and the
same was to be signified to our lord the pope and the court of
Rome, in order that discreet men might be present on their be-
half, to the end that a divorce of such solemn nature might be
legally accomplished.

In the same year, Sancho, king of Navarre, hearing of the
losses and mischiefs that were inflicted upon his territories by
Alphonso, king of Castille, and the king of Arragon, who had
gained possession of nearly the whole thereof, returned from
Africa, and, again entering his territories, made a truce with the
said kings, his adversaries, to last for the space of three years.
45 An adaptation of St. John, xi. 50.



480 ANNALS OF EOGER DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1200.

In the same year, that is to say, from the year of the Incar-
nation of our Lord one thousand two hundred, John, king of
England, was at Worcester, in England, on Easter day, which
fell on the fifth day before the ides of April, and shortly after
he crossed from England into Normandy.

In the meantime, queen Eleanor, the mother of John, king
of England, whom he had sent to Alphonso, king of Castille,
for the purpose of giving the daughter of the said king of Cas-
tille in marriage to Louis, the son of Philip, king of France,
returned, having obtained the daughter of the king of Castille.
When she had arrived at the city of Bordeaux, and was staying
there, on account of the solemnity of Easter, Man-hade's, the
chief of the Brabanters, came to her, and on the second day in
Easter week the said Marchades was slain in the said city of
Bordeaux, by a man-at-arms in the service of Brandin. After
this, queen Eleanor, being fatigued with old age and the labour
of the length of the journey, betook herself to the abbey of
Fontevraud, and there remained ; while the daughter of the
king of Castille, with Elias, archbishop of Bordeaux, and the
others who attended her, proceeded to Normandy, and there de-
livered her into the charge of king John, her uncle.

On the octave of the Nativity of Saint John the Baptist,
Philip, king of France, and the king of England, met to hold
a conference between Buttevant, a castle belonging to the king
of England, and Gaillon, a castle of the king of France, on the
eleventh day before the calends of June, being the second day of
the week. At this conference, the king of France restored to
John, king of England, the city of Evreux, and the whole
county thereof, and all the castles, cities, and lands of which he
had gained possession in Normandy during the war, as also
in the other territories of the king of England ; and John, king
of England, immediately did homage for the same to Philip,
king of France, and forthwith bestowed the whole thereof on
Louis, the son of the said king of France, as a marriage portion,
with his niece, the daughter of Alphonso, king of Castille ; and
on the following day, that is to say, on the tenth day before
the calends of July, being the third day of the week, the be-
fore-named daughter of the king of Castille was married to
Louis, the son of Philip, king of France, at Purmor, in Nor-
mandy, by the before-named archbishop of Bordeaux, many
bishops and other religious being present, as also many counts
and barons of the kingdom of France. But at this time

the kingdom of France was under an interdict on account of
queen Botilda, whom the king of France had put away. Im-
mediately after his marriage, the said Louis took with him
into France his wife, the daughter of the king of Castille.

While these things were going on, upon the same day, Philip,
king of France, and John, king of England, held a conference
at_Vernon, at this time a town of the king of France ; and
Tiere ArtEur, duke of Brittany, did homage to his uncle John,
king of England, for Brittany and his other territories, with
the sanction and advice of the king of France ; but Arthur,
being given up by the king of England, remained in the charge
of the king of France.

In the same year, John, king of England, gave to Zachary,
the prior of Saint Alban's, the abbacy of Burgh, and to the prior
of Burgh he gave the abbacy of Ramsey. In this year also,
Robert, count de Drues, brother of Philip, bishop of Beauvais,
departed this life. In the same year, on Easter day, which fell
on the fifth day before the ides of April, nearly the whole of
the city of Rouen was destroyed by fire, together with the church
of the archiepiscopal see, and many other churches besides.

In the same year, Otho, king of the Germans, who had been
elected emperor of the Romans, sent Henry, duke of Saxony,
and William of Winchester, his brothers, to his uncle John,
king of England, to demand of him the earldom of York
and the earldom of Poitou, which Richard, king of England,
had given him, as also two-fourths of the whole of the treasures
of Richard, king of England, and all the jewels which the
said king had left him by devise. But John, king of England,
would not accede to any of these requests, in consequence of
the oath which he had sworn to the king of France, to the
effect that he would give no assistance whatever to Otho against
the duke of Suabia.

In the same year, shortly before the festival of Saint Peter
ad Vincula, a pitched battle was fought between the before-
named Otho and Philip, duke of Suabia, at Brunswick; in
which battle, Otho came off victorious, and took prisoners more
than two hundred knights of the household of the duke of
Suabia.

In the same year, John, king of England gave to Philip, bishop
of Durham, leave to hold a fair each year at Hoveden, and at
Alverton. 47 To William de Stuteville also, the said king gave per-
47 North Allerton.

mission each year to hold a fair at Butterham andatCoggingham,
and to build castles at those places. The said king also gave a
license to Eichard de Malebise to fortify a castle at Oweldric ;
but after he had nearly built it, the citizens of York, thinking
that this had been done to their detriment and disgrace, pre-
vailed upon William de Stuteville, at this time sheriff of York,
on the king's behalf, to forbid llichard de Malebise to fortify
the said castle, and accordingly in that state it remained.

In the same year, William de Stuteville gave to John, king
of England, three thousand marks of silver, to obtain judgment
for the barony of "William de Mowbray, which the said William
de Stuteville claimed in the king's court, against the said Wil-
liam de Mowbray. For it should be known, that Eobert
Grundebeof, the great grandfather of the said William de Stute-
ville, held the said barony on the conquest of England; but the
said Robert Grundebeof, leaving Henry, king of England, son
of king William the Bastard, who had subdued England in
war, gave in his adhesion to Eobert Curthose, duke of Nor-
mandy, when he claimed the kingdom of England in right of
his father against the aforesaid Henry, king of England, his
younger brother ; and in the battle which took place between the
said two brothers, that is, between Henry, king of England, and
Eobert Curthose, his brother, duke of Normandy, at Tenchebrai,
Henry, king of England, was victorious, and took Eobert Curt-
hose, his brother, and kept him in prison until the end of his
life, as he also did Eobert Grundebeof ; and king Henry gave
his barony to Mgel de Aubigny, the great grandfather of the
said William de Mowbray. It ought also to be known, that
Eobert de Stuteville, the father of the before-named William
de Stuteville, in the time of king Henry the Second, laid claim
to the said barony against Eoger de Mowbray, the father of
the before-named William de Mowbray; on which an arrange-
ment was made between them, by which Eoger de Mowbray
gave to Eobert de Stuteville Kirby-in-Moreshead, with its ap-
purtenances, together with nine 48 knight's fees, for his homage,
in full discharge of his claim. But, because this arrangement
had not been confirmed in the king's court, and sanctioned by
his authority, the said William de Stuteville again laid claim
to the said barony, in the court of John, king of England.

However, after the contention had been long carried on, at
length, byJke.cQnsent of the kingdom, and at the king's de-
43 V. r."Ten,"



A.D. 1200. DISSENSION AT PABIS. 483

sire, peace and a final reconciliation were made between the
said William de Stuteville and "William de Mowbray, to the
following effect : William de Stuteville renounced his claim
which he made against "William de Mowbray respecting his
barony, and William de Mowbray gave to William de Stute-
ville, for his homage and for the renunciation of his claim,
nine knight's fees in addition, and twelve pounds of yearly
revenue. And thus, all their disputes being settled on both
sides, they became reconciled in the presence of John, king of
England, in the second year of his reign, at Lue in Lindesey, a
vill of the bishops of Lincoln, on the first Sunday in Septuagesima.

In the same year, Philip, king of Prance, gave to the Jews
permission to reside at Paris and in his other cities, he having
expelled them therefrom in the first year of his reign.

In the same year, John, king of England, immediately after
the agreement made between him and the king of France, set
out for Aquitaine with a large army, but no one was found to
make head against him.

In this year also, a divorce was effected between John, king
of England, and Hawisa, his wife, daughter of William, earl
of Gloucester, by Elias, bishop of Bordeaux, William, bishop
of Poitou, and Henry, bishop of Saintes, because they were
related in the third degree of affinity. After this divorce had
taken place between John, king of England, and his wife,
the king of England, by the advice of his lord, Philip, king
of France, married Isabel, the daughter of Ailmar, count of
Angouleme, whom the said count, by the sanction and advice
of Richard, king of England, had previously given to Hugh
Le Brun, count de la Marche ; and the said count had ac-
knowledged her as his wife, by promise made as pledge for the
future, 49 and she had taken him for her husband by promise made
for the future ; for because she had not yet attained marriage-
ble years, the said Hugh declined to be united to her in pre-
sence of the church. However, the father of the damsel, on
seeing that John, king of England, had a fancy for her, took her
out of the custody of Hugh Le Brun, and gave her in mar-
riage to John, king of England ; and she was immediately mar-
ried to John, king of England, at Angouleme, by Elias, arch-
bishop of Bordeaux.

In the same year, a serious dissension arose between the
students and citizens of Paris, the origin of which was as fol-
49 " Verba de praesenti."

lows. There was in Paris a German student, of noble family,
being one of those selected for the office of bishop of Liege.
While a servant of his was buying some wine at a tavern, he
was beaten, and his wine-vessel broken. On hearing of this,
a meeting took place of the clerks of German birth, and, en-
tering the tavern, they wounded the master of the house, and,
after severely beating him, took their departure, leaving him
nearly dead. On this, there was an outcry among the people,
and the whole city was in commotion; so much so, that
Thomas, the mayor of Paris, in arms, together with the populace
of the city, who were likewise armed, made an assault upon the
quarters of the German students ; in which conflict the said
noble scholar, who [as before-mentioned] was one of those
selected for the office of bishop of Liege, was slain, together
with some of his companions.

On this, the masters of the schools at Paris went to Philip,
king of France, and made complaint to him against Thomas,
the mayor, and his accomplices, who had slain the said scho-
lars ; and, at their request, Thomas, the mayor, was arrested.
Some of his accomplices were also seized and thrown into
prison, while others of them took to flight, leaving their
homes and possessions ; on which, the king of Prance, being
incensed, caused their houses to be levelled with the ground,
and their vineyards and fruit-bearing trees to be rooted up.

As to the mayor, the following determination was come to : he
was to be kept in the king's prison, not to be released therefrom,
until such time as he should have cleared himself by the judgment
of water or of iron ; and, if he were cast, he was to be hanged,
and if acquitted thereby, he was, at the king's mercy, to abjure
the realm. However, the scholars, taking pity on him, entreated
the king of France that the mayor and his accomplices, after
being whipped in the schools after the manner of scholars,
might be discharged, and restored to their possessions. This,
however, the king of France refused, saying, that it would be
most derogatory to his honor if any other person than himself
were to inflict punishment on his offenders.

The king of France also, being apprehensive that the master
of the scholars, and the scholars themselves, might withdraw
from the city, made satisfaction to them by enacting, that in
future no clerk should be brought before a secular tribunal,
for any offence whatsoever that he might have committed ; but
that if a clerk should be guilty of any offence, he should be

handed over to the bishop, and be dealt with according to the
judgment of the clergy. The king of Prance also enacted,
that whoever should be mayor of Paris, should make oath
that he would keep faith with the clerks, saving always his
fealty to the king. The said king also gave to the scholars an
assurance of his protection, and, by his charter, confirmed the
same.

As for the mayor, after he had been confined several days
in the king's prison, he determined to escape by flight, but
while he was descending from the wall, the rope broke, and,
falling from a height to the ground, he was killed.

In the same year, Margarite, the leader of the pirates, whom
Henry, emperor of the Romans, had caused to be deprived of
his sight, came to Paris, to Philip, king of France, and offered
him, if he would follow his advice, to make him emperor of
the Romans, or emperor of Constantinople, whichever he
should prefer. To this, the king of France gave a ready assent,
and prepared all necessaries for his expedition, horses, arms,
men, 50 and equipments. Margarite, then preceding the king
of France, in order that he might arrange as he had pro-
mised, sent word throughout all parts of his dominions for all
his galleys to meet him at Brindisi ; but on his arrival at Rome,
he was slain by a servant of his, whom he had maltreated ;
and so, this accident intervening, the king of France was baulked
of his hopes.

In the same year, died the archbishop of Mentz, who, in
the city of Mentz, had acknowledged Philip, duke of Suabia,
as his lord, and had crowned him king there. On his decease,
the clergy and people of the city made choice of a certain
noble clerk of their number for archbishop, and presented him
to Philip, duke of Suabia ; but he rejected him, and wished,
contrary to their desire, to appoint one of his own relations
bishop of that place. Being greatly indignant at this, the
clergy and people of Mentz, rejecting the duke of Suabia, gave
their adhesion to Otho, king of the Germans, and acknowledged
him as their lord ; and he, upon their presentation, received the
person whom they had chosen as archbishop ; while Otho himself
was, on the day of the Nativity of our Lord, crowned king at
Mentz, by the said archbishop of Mentz. On hearing of this,
Philip, duke of Suabia, ordered the treasures to be conveyed
to him which he had in those parts ; which coming to the
80 ' Viribus" is probably an error for " viris."

knowledge of Otho, he kept a watch night and day upon the
street along which the duke's men were to pass with his trea-
sures ; and so, taking no precaution against the same, while
on their road, they fell into the hands of Otho, and they and
the treasures were captured ; and thus Otho was enriched with
the treasures of the duke of Suabia, his enemy.

In the same year, one of the companions of the above-named
Eulk, Eustace by name, the lord abbat of Elaye, came into Eng-
land from the country of Normandy, to preach the word of
the Lord, and did wondrous things during his life. Among
these, he did one work that is wondrous in our eyes. Eor
the said Eustace came to a town not far from Canterbury, of
which the name is Wye, and there he bestowed his blessing
on a certain spring, on which the Lord poured forth so exceed-
ingly His grace, that whoever drank of the spring so blessed,
the blind received their sight, the lame their power of walk-
ing, the dumb their speech, and the deaf their hearing, and
every infirm person who drank thereof, rejoiced that he was
restored to health.

On this, a certain woman came to the abbat, being pos-
sessed by devils, and stout to a degree beyond what is credible,
as though swollen by dropsy, and sought to be restored by him
to health ; to whom the abbat made answer, " Daughter, have
faith, and go to the pools of the spring at Wye, which the Lord
hath blessed ; drink thereof, and thence thou shalt receive
health." She departed, and, drinking thereof, was seized
with a vomiting, on which there came forth from her two large
black toads, which were immediately transformed into dogs of
immense size and very black, and shortly after took the forms
of asses. As to the woman, she stood astounded, and soon after
ran after them, raving, and trying to catch them ; but a certain
man, who had been appointed to take charge of the said spring,
sprinkled some of the water from the spring between the
woman and the monsters ; who, immediately departing, flew
up into the air, leaving behind them foul traces of their foot-
steps. The woman was made whole from that hour, magni-
fying God, who had given such power unto men.

Also, the said abbat, coming to Eumenel, 50 where there was a

deficiency of water, at the request of the people, struck a stone in

the church in that town with his staff, on which water flowed

forth, the draughts of which are a cure for various maladies. He

also, by his preaching, turned the hearts of many to the release
of claims for interest, and to the assumption of the Cross in the
expedition to Jerusalem. At London also, and many other
places throughout England, he effected by his preaching, that
from that time forward people did not dare to hold market
of things exposed for sale on the Lord's day.

He also enacted in London and several other places, that in
each church that had the means, there should be always a lamp
kept burning, or some never-failing light, before the body of our
Lord. He also caused, by means of his preaching, that many
of the citizens and other discreet men kept daily upon their
table an alms-dish, in which to place some part of their food
for those poor who have no means of their own. Accordingly,
for these and other works of mercy, the enemy of mankind raised
against this man of God the ministers of iniquity, who said to
him, "It is not lawful for thee to reap another's harvest;" to
which he replied, "The harvest truly is great, but the labourers
are few." 51 However, the said abbat, on being censured by the
ministers of Satan, was unwilling any longer to molest the
prelates of England by his preaching, but returned to Normandy,
unto his place whence he had come.

In the same year, Raymond, earl of Saint Gilles, did homage
to John, king of England, for the lands and castles which Richard,
king of England, had given him as a marriage portion with his
sister Joanna, upon the understanding that when Raymond,
his son by his wife Joanna, should come to the years of discre-
tion, he should have all the estates before-mentioned, and
should do homage for the same to John, king of England, his
uncle; but if he should depart this life without issue, the same
were to revert to the earl of Saint Gilles : and he himself, and
his heirs after him, were to hold all the same as of hereditary
right of the earl of Poitou, by the service of coming with five
hundred knights to serve the earl of Poitou as often as the earl
of Poitou should go into Gascony with his army, for 'one month
at his own expense, but if he should stay there longer than
that period, the earl of Poitou was to provide all necessaries.

After this, John, king of England, came to Anjou, and re-
ceived from it one hundred and fifty hostages as pledges that
it would preserve its fealty to him, whom he placed under ward.

In the same year, died John of Oxford, bishop of Norwich,
and was succeeded in his bishopric by John de Gray, at the
51 St. Luke x. 2. *

presentation of king John ; on which, Hubert, archbishop of
Canterbury, consecrated him bishop. In the same year, John,
king of England, gave to Gilles, son of William de Braose, the
bishopric of Hereford, and he was consecrated bishop by Hu-
bert, archbishop of Canterbury. In this year also, John, king
of England, received from Walter, archbishop of Rouen, six
hundred pounds of money Anjouin, and by his charter confirmed
to him the possession of all those places which Richard, king of
England, had given him in exchange for Andely, that is to say,
the town of Dieppe with its appurtenances, Louviers with its
appurtenances, and the forest of Aliermont, together with the
mill of Robeck.

In the same year, Geoffrey, archbishop of York, and his ad-
versaries, namely, Simon, the dean, and the other clergy of
the church of Saint Peter at York, met at Westminster, in
presence of Herbert, bishop of Salisbury, and Alan, abbat of
Tewkesbury, judges delegate of our lord the pope ; and, after
the allegations on both sides had been fully stated, the said
judges endeavoured by every method to bring them to a recon-
ciliation, and at length, by the aid of God, succeeded in in-
ducing the said archbishop to receive with the kiss of peace,
first, William Testard, archdeacon of Nottingham, then Reginald
Arundel, the praecentor, and, last of all, Simon, the dean, of
the church of York, on condition that they should give satis-
faction to each other respectively as to their disputes in the
chapter at York.

In the same year, peace and final reconciliation was made
between Hubert, archbishop of Canterbury, and the monks of
the church of the Holy Trinity at Canterbury, by Hugh, bishop
of Lincoln, Eustace, bishop of Ely, and Samson, abbat of
of Saint Edmund's, who were appointed judges in that matter
by our lord the pope Innocent. But, as the lord bishop of
Lincoln was unable to take part in the settlement of the said
dispute, he appointed, as his substitute, Roger de Robleston,
dean of the church of Lincoln.

Accordingly, an arrangement was made between them to the
following effect : that the said archbishop of Canterbury might,
if he should think proper, rebuild the chapel of Lambeth in the
same place, though not upon the same foundations, on which it
had been previously built, and that he should not establish there
canons secular, but should be at liberty, if he should think fit, to
establish there canons regular of the Prsemonstratensian order,



A.D. 1200. SYNOD HELD IN LONDON. 489

to be in number thirteen at the least, and twenty at the most ;
and, for their support, the archbishop was to give, if he should
think proper, out of the churches in his presentation, one hundred
pounds of money yearly at the most ; but in the said church
he was neither to make the chrism, nor consecrate bishops.

Also, as to the four churches which Richard, archbishop of
Canterbury, of blessed memory, had given to the use of the
said monks, it was thus arranged : Simon, archdeacon of Wells,
was to pay to the aforesaid monks of the Holy Trinity, at Can-
terbury, ten pieces of gold, yearly, during his life, as being the
payment made by the church of Monkton, in Thanet ; and, after
the decease of the said Simon, a moiety of the tithes of corn
and pulse belonging to the said church, was to be applied to
the augmentation of the alms of the monks aforesaid ; while the
remaining moiety belonging to the said church, and the offerings
at the altar, were to be at the disposal of the archbishop. The
same also was to be done as to the church of Eastry, in con-
sideration of Master Ralph, the possessor thereof, during his
life, making to the said monks a yearly payment of six pieces
of gold. Robert Belesmains, the former archbishop of Lyons, was
to be at liberty to retain possession of the church of Aylesford
during his life, and, after his decease, the aforesaid monks of
Canterbury were to receive in augmentation of their alms, the
third part of the tithes of corn and pulse belonging to the
said church, and all the rest belonging to that church was to
be at the disposal of the archbishop. The same was to be done
as to the church of Meopham, except that Yirgilius, the holder
thereof, was to pay from the same to the aforesaid monks of
Canterbury one piece of gold, by way of annual payment,
during his life.

As to the yearly gifts which the monks demanded from their
own manors, they were to remain with the archbishop during
his life, and, after the death of the said archbishop, his successor
was to enjoy the possession thereof, saving always the share of
the monks. As to the division of the marsh lands belonging
to the archbishop and the monks, it was provided that, on the
oaths of twelve or more lawful men, it should be ascertained how
much ought to belong to the archbishop, and how much to the
monks ; which very same thing the archbishop had repeatedly
offered them. The archbishop also allowed them to hold a court
for their own tenants, without making any payment for the
said license. All the matters above stated were agreed upon



490 ANNALS OF EOGEE DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1200.

between them, and duly confirmed, reserving always the au-
thorization thereof by our lord the pope.

In the same year, Hubert, archbishop of Canterbury, held a
general synod at London ; this took place at Westminster, in
spite of the prohibition of Geoffrey Fitz-Peter, earl, of .Essex,
at this time chief justiciary of England. At this synod, the
said archbishop published the decrees under-written, and en-
acted that the same should be inviolably observed by those sub-
ject to him :

The Decrees of Hubert, archbishop of Canterbury.
"Inasmuch as, in the celebration of Divine service, errors
are made, not without peril to the body as well as to the soul, we
do, with the healthful advice of this synod, enact, that by every
priest who officiates, the words of the canon shall be fully and
distinctly uttered, and that the time shall not be cut short
by too great haste, nor yet prolonged by excessive slowness.
For it is proper not to delay too long at the same, because of
thoughts that spring up, which, like dead flies, destroy the
sweetness of the ointment. In like manner, all the hours, 51
and all the offices, are to be openly and distinctly repeated, so
as not to be cut short from excessive haste, nor are the words to
be clipped. If this ordinance shall not be observed, those priests
who do not observe it, after the third admonition, are to be
suspended until such time as they shall have given full satis-
faction. This, saving in all things the honor and privileges of
the Holy Church of Rome."

The same Priest is not to be allowed to celebrate [the mass]
twice in the same day.

"A priest is not to be allowed to celebrate [the mass] twice
in the same day, except in case of urgent necessity ; and then
in cases where the same person shall officiate twice in one day,
after the first celebration and the receiving of the blood, nothing
more is to be poured into the chalice. Also, after the first
celebration, the drops are to be most carefully dried up from out
of the chalice, and the fingers are to be sucked or licked with
the tongue, and then washed, the rinsings thereof being reserved
in a clean vessel, especially appropriated for that purpose, which
same rinsings are to be received after the second celebration.
This is to be done, unless there be present at the first celebra-
tion a deacon, or some other fitting minister, who, in such
M See vol. i. p. 331.






A.D. 1200. DECREES OF THE SYNOD OF LONDON. 491

case, may take the said rinsings. To this we add, that the
Eucharist is to be kept in a clean and fair pyx, and that the
same is to be carried to the sick, in a clean and fair pyx, a linen
cloth being placed over the same, and a lantern and cross pre-
ceding it, unless the sick person shall happen to be at a very
great distance. Also, the host itself is to be renewed each
Lord's day, and certainty is to be observed relative to the
Eucharist, so that what is unconsecrated may not be taken as
though it were consecrated. To this we have thought proper
to add, that the communion of the Eucharist is not to be given
in secret to any person asking for the same ; but it is to be
given, publicly and immediately, to him who asks for it, unless
his oifences are of a public nature. This, saving in all things
the honor and privileges of the Holy Church of Rome."

Of Baptism or Confirmation, if there are doubts thereon.

" As to baptism or confirmation, if there are doubts thereon,
following the enactments of the holy canons, we do enact that
the same shall be given, ' because that cannot be said to be
repeated which is not known to have been already done.'
Therefore, children exposed, about whose baptism there are
doubts, are to be baptized, whether found with salt, or whether
without salt. 55 We do also add, that no person shall be held at
confirmation, by his father or mother, step-father or step-
mother. Also, it is not to be allowable for deacons to baptize,
or to give absolution, except in two cases of necessity ; because
either the priest cannot, through absence, or will not, through
foolishness, and the death of the child or sick person is immi-
nent. And, if in a case of necessity, a child is baptized by a
layman, which may be done by the father or mother, irrespective
of their being married, let the service that follows the immer-
sion, though not that which precedes it, be performed by a
priest. This, saving in all things the honor and privileges of
the Holy Church of Borne."

Of Penance.

"Inasmuch, as in penance, which is a 'second plank in
shipwreck,' the more necessary reparation is after a lapse,
the greater the circumspection that must be employed ; we,
following the enactments of the holy canons, do command, that
in enjoining penance, priests shall diligently attend to the cir-

55 See p. 363.



492 ANNALS OF EOGEE DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1200.

cumstances, that is to say, the position of the person, the ex-
tent of the offence, the time, place, cause, and period occu-
pied in the sin, as also, the devoutness of the feelings of the
penitent; and such a penance is to be enjoined on the wife,
that she may not be rendered suspected by her husband of any
secret and enormous sin, and the same is to be observed as to
the husband. Also, no priest, after a lapse, is to presume to
come to the altar, to celebrate [the mass], before he has made
confession. This also we do add, in order to restrain the
avarice of the priesthood, that masses are not to be enjoined,
by way of penance, to any persons who are not priests. 56 This,
saving in all things the honor and privileges of the Holy Church
of Rome."

In what manner the archbishop, bishop, and their officers are to
be entertained by their subjects.

"Inasmuch as among the enactments that have been made by
the fathers of modern times, those of the council of Lateran 57
are most distinguished and most worthy in every way to be
observed ; we, humbly and devoutly following the instructions
thereof, do enact, that an archbishop, when visiting his province,
shall on no account exceed the number of forty or fifty, and a
bishop twenty or thirty horses; while an archdeacon shall not
have more than five or seven, and deans who are appointed
under bishops are to be content with two. They are not to go
about with hounds or hawks, but are to proceed so as to appear
to seek not their own things, but those of Christ. 58 We do
also forbid them to presume to oppress those in subjection to
them with tallages and exactions. However, we do permit
them, considering the many necessities that sometimes arise,
in case a manifest and reasonable cause shall exist, to be at
liberty with all brotherly love to ask of them some slight as-
sistance. For whereas the Apostle says, * The children ought
not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children,' 59
it seems to be at variance with fatherly affection, if those who
are the governors should be burdensome to those in subjection
to them, whom, like shepherds, they ought in all their necessi-
ties to cherish. Archdeacons or deans are to presume to demand
no exactions or tallage from priests or clerks. Further, what
has been above said as to the number of horses, is to be ob-

56 For if the persons had to pay for them, the priesthood might, if
avariciously inclined, have an interest in multiplying such penances.
V See vol. i. p. 497. w Alluding to Phil. ii. 21. 69 2 Cor. xii. 14.



A.D. 1200. DECREES OF THE STNOD OF LONDON. 493

served in those places of which the revenues and the property
of the church are ample ; but in poor places it is our will that
such limits should be observed, that the lesser ones shall not
have to complain that a hardship is inflicted by the arrival of
the greater ; so that those persons who have hitherto employed
a smaller number of horses, may not suppose that they are to
be indulged with leave to use more. It belongs also to the
duty of visitation, in the first place to attend with all diligence
to those matters which relate to the saving of souls, and to see
that each church has a silver chalice, and sufficient and proper
sacerdotal vestments, the necessary books and utensils, and
other things that relate to worship and due respect for the
sacrament. Further, to put an end to the vice both of avarice
as well as negligence, relying on the authority of the council
of Toledo, we do command that no visitor shall presume to
demand entertainment, or a sum in lieu of entertainment, from
a church in which he has not in the customary manner per-
formed the duties of visitation. This, saving in all things the
honor and privileges of the Holy Church of Rome."

That no person shall le ordained without a certain title.

"We do also, in conformity with the decrees of the council of
Lateran, enjoin that it shall be strictly observed, that if a
bishop shall ordain any person without a certain title deacon or
priest, he shall support such person until such time as he shall
provide him in some church a suitable salary for clerical duties;
unless the person who is so ordained shall be able to maintain
himself by his own means or on property inherited from his
father. "We do enact the same as to the ordination of subdeacons,
and do add, that if, without the especial command of his bishop,
an archdeacon shall present any one of the parties before named
for ordination, and such person shall, upon his presentation, be
ordained, he shall be subject to the penalty above-mentioned. 60
This, saving in all things the honor and privileges of the Holy
Church of Rome."

That it is not allowable to pronounce sentence of excommunication
unless canonical admonition shall have preceded it.

11 Again, following the decrees of the council of Lateran, we
do order that prelates shall not pronounce sentence of sus-
pense or excommunication on those subject to them, unless the
60 Of having to support the person ordained.



494 ANNALS OF BOGEE DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 12CO.

same be a fault which, by its very nature, entails the penalty
of excommunication. Also, those subject to prelates are not,
contrary to ecclesiastical discipline, before the commencement
of the trial, to seek to take refuge in the words of appeal. Eut
if any person shall think that it is a matter of necessity for
him to appeal, then a competent time is to be named for him
to prosecute his appeal : and if he shall neglect to prosecute it
within such time, then the bishop shall be at liberty to exercise
his authority. If also, in any matter any person shall make an
appeal [against another], and on the person appealed against
making his appearance, the person who has made the appeal
shall not appear, he is to make a competent return to the other
for his expenses, in order that, being at least checked by this
fear, a person may not be too ready to appeal to the prejudice
of another ; and in religious houses we do especially desire
that this shall be observed, to the end that neither monks nor
any other person of the religious orders, when they shall re-
quire correction for any excess, shall, contrary to the regular
discipline of their prelate and chapter, presume to appeal, but
humbly and dutifully receive whatever may have been for the

lore effectually securing their salvation enjoined them. Also,
for the purpose of checking the viciousness of many, we have
thought proper to adjoin hereto, that, every year, sentence of
excommunication shall be pronounced upon sorcerers, perjurers
upon the Gospels, 61 incendiaries, thieves, and daring robbers,
each in his class. Also, we do enact that those who shall

lowingly have committed perjury at the expense of any
person shall not be absolved therefrom ; nor shall penance be
enjoined them by any person but the bishop of the diocese, or
upon his authority, except at the point of death ; and they
are to be enjoined at the moment that they shall recover to go
to the bishop to receive penance from him or upon his autho-
rity. This, saving in all things the honor and privileges of
the Holy Church of Rome."

That nothing is to le demanded for the administration of the
sacraments.

" As it has been, in the Council of Lateran, healthfully pro-
vided by the holy fathers, so do we forbid that anything
whatever shall be exacted from ecclesiastical personages when

61 This is probably the meaning of " sacramenta" here, though it may
possibly mean the relics of saints.



A.D. 1200. DECREES OF THE SYNOD OF LONDON. 495

being installed in their sees, or from priests, or any other
clerks, when being instituted, or for burying the dead, or
for blessing the newly - married, or for the chrism, or for
any other of the sacraments. And if any person shall pre-
sume to contravene this enactment, let him to know that he
will have his portion with Gehazi, whose deeds he has imitated
by this exaction of a disgraceful gift. To this we do add, that
nothing shall be demanded from priests for license to celebrate
Divine service, or from masters for teaching ; and, if any such
sums shall have been paid, the same are to be returned. On the
authority also of the same council, we do forbid that new
imposts shall be exacted from churches by bishops, or abbats,
or other prelates, or that the old ones shall be increased, nor
are they to presume to appropriate any part of the revenues
thereof to their own use ; but, with good will, let those of higher
rank preserve for their inferiors that liberty which they desire
to be preserved for themselves. And if any person shall act con-
trary hereto, let that which he shall have so done be deemed of
no effect. Also, no ecclesiastical offices, or benefices, or churches,
be given or promised to any person before they are vacant ; to
the end that no person may seem to long for the death of his
neighbour, to whose place or benefice he believes he shall suc-
ceed. For whereas, in the very places of the heathens we find
this forbidden by law, it is most disgraceful, and most deserving
of the censures of the Divine judgment, if, in the Church of
God, expectation of succession should hold a place, which even
the heathens themselves have taken care to condemn. This,
saving in all things the honor and privileges of the Holy Church
of Borne."

That Tithes are not to le diminished under pretence of icages of
servants or of the reapers.

" Inasmuch as Abraham, by his actions, and Jacob, in his
promises, signified that tithes ought to be given to God and to
the priests of God, and the authority of the Old and the New
Testament, as also the enactments of the holy fathers, have
declared that tithes ought to be paid of all things which are
yearly renewed, we do decree that the same shall be inviolably
observed, and that no diminution shall be made of the tenth
part under pretence of wages of servants or of the reapers,
but the same is to be paid in full. Priests are also to have the
power, before the commencement of autumn, of excomnmni-

eating all curtailers of their tithes, and of absolving the same,
in due ecclesiastical form. To this sanction we do also add,
that, from lands newly brought into cultivation, tithes are not
to be paid to any other than the parish churches within the
limits of whose parishes the lands are cultivated from which the
said tithes arise. Also, withholders of tithes, in accordance
with the enactment of the council of Rouen, if, on being warned
a first, second, and third time, they do not correct their ex-
cesses, shall be brought by the ban of excommunication to make
condign satisfaction. This, saving in all things the honor and
privileges of the Holy Church of Rome."

That Clerics in holy orders shall not keep concubines.

"We do enact that, in churches of which the yearly revenues
do not exceed in amount the sum of three marks, no person
shall be instituted, unless he shall be willing to perform duty
there in his own person. We do also, reverently following
the enactments of the Council of Lateran, enact that clerks in
holy orders, who, bearing the character of incontinence, shall
be keeping young women in their houses, shall either put away
the same and live chastely, or else be removed from their eccle-
siastical duties and benefices. To this we do also add, that
clerks shall not be present at taverns or at public drinkings.
For hence arise contentions and strifes, so that laymen, by some-
times striking clerks, render themselves amenable to canonical
censures ; and, when these are brought before the pope, it is
not just that the clerks, who have in some measure caused the
offence, should remain unpunished. All clerks are also to wear
the clerical dress and the tonsure prescribed by the canons.
But archdeacons, as also the others who hold dignities, and
priests, are to wear hoods with long sleeves attached thereto.
This, saving in all things the honor and privileges of the Holy
Church of Rome."

What persons may enter the Marriage state.

" A man is not to marry any female relative by blood of
his former wife; and, in like manner, the wife is not to
marry any male relative of her former husband. He who has
been received at baptism, is not to marry the daughter of him
who baptized him, or of him who received him [at the font],
whether born before or since that time. Also, no marriage is to
be contracted without notice thereof being thrice given in the

church, nor yet if the persons shall not be known. Also, no
persons are to be united in marriage, except publicly in face of
the church and in presence of the priest ; and, if this shall
not be observed^ those parties are to be admitted into no church
whatsoever, except by the especial authority of the bishop.
Also, it is to be allowable for neither of two married persons
to undertake a distant pilgrimage, unless upon publication of
the consent of both. This, saving in all things the honor and
privileges of the Holy Church of Rome."

That Purgation is to be enjoined on those who are accused by
public report.

" Those who are accused by public report, or on probable
evidence, of any crime of which they cannot be convicted, are
to be warned a first, second, and third time to confess and make
satisfaction. But if, making no amends, they shall persist in
their denial, then let purgation 63 be enjoined them, and let it
not be put off from day to day as a pretext for receiving money ;
but let the same be received on the first day on which it is en-
joined, if the person is ready ; and let not the number 64 pre-
scribed by the canons be exceeded. This, saving in all things
the honor and privileges of the Holy Church of Rome."

That Lepers are to have a burial (/round and chapel of their own.

" Being induced by a regard for piety, and relying on the
enactment of the council of Lateran, we do enact, that wherever
there shall be a sufficient number of lepers assembled together
to be able to build a church, with a burying ground attached,
and to enjoy the services of their own priest, they shall be
allowed, without any opposition, to have the same. They are
to take care, however, that they are not detrimental to churches
previously established; for that which is conceded to them
on grounds of piety, we do not wish to redound to the injury
of other persons. We do also enact, that of vegetable pro-
duce and the young of animals belonging to such persons, they
shall not be obliged to pay tithes. This, saving in all things
the honor and privileges of the Holy Church of Rome."

That no person shall, without the authority of the bishop, receive
ecclesiastical benefices at the hands of



" Paying all due attention to the enactments of the council
of Lateran, we do decree that neither the brethren of the Tem-
ple nor of the Hospital, nor any other person of the religious
order, shall receive either tithes or any other ecclesiastical be-
nefices at the hands of laymen, without authority of their
bishops, and excepting therefrom those which up to the present
time they have received, contrary to the tenor thereof. We
do enact that such persons as shall be excommunicated, and
shall, in accordance with the sentence of the bishops, be by
name laid under interdict, shall be avoided by them as well as
all others. In their churches, which do not belong to them by
full legal right, they are to present priests for institution to
the bishops, that they may be answerable to them for their
care of the people, and give to themselves a full account
as to the temporal things thereof. Also, those who have
been instituted, they are not, without the sanction of the
bishops, to presume to remove. If Templars or Hospitallers
should come to a church under interdict, they are only once in
a year to be ' admitted to the performance of divine service
therein, nor even then are they to bury the bodies of those un-
der interdict therein. As to the fraternities, we do also enact
that if they shall not [upon warning] entirely join the brethren
before-mentioned, but shall think proper to reside upon their
own properties, 66 still for all this they are on no account to be
exempt from the sentence of the bishops, who are to exercise
their authority over them just the same as they do in the case
of others in their dioceses, when they require to be corrected for
their excesses. What has been stated as to the brethren be-
fore named, we do also command to be observed with regard to
those of other religious orders, who, in their presumption, wrest
from the bishops their legal rights, and dare to enter upon a
course contrary to their own canonical profession, and the
tenor of our own privileges. And if they shall infringe upon
this ordinance, both the churches in which they have presumed
so to do, shall be laid under interdict, and all that they shall
have done, shall, by the authority of the said council, be deemed
null and void. Monks also are not to be admitted into mo-

nasteries for money, nor are they to be allowed to hold private
property of their own ; nor are they to be placed alone in vills
and towns, or in any parish churches ; but they are to remain
in the general convent, or with some others of the brethren, and
not alone among secular people to await the attack of their spi-
ritual foes ; for it is Solomon who says, ' "Woe to him that is
alone when he falleth, for he hath not another to help him up/ 6C
And if any person, on demand made, shall pay anything for his
admission he shall not be admitted to canonical orders ; and
he who receives the same, is to be punished by loss of his
office. If any [monk] also shall have any private property,
unless he shall have received permission from the abbat for the
administration of certain duties enjoined, the said person is to
be removed from the communion of the altar ; and for him who
at the point of death shall be found to be in possession of private
property, no offering is to be made, and he is not to receive burial
among the brotherhood. The same also, we do enact, with re-
ference to the various religious orders ; and the abbat who shall
not with due diligence pay attention to the same, is to know
that he will thereby incur the loss of his office. Priorships also,
or abbacies, 67 are to be given to no person for the receipt of
money ; and if this shall be transgressed, let both the giver and
the receiver, be removed from the administration of their eccle-
siastical duties. Also, when priors shall have been appointed
in conventual churches, they shall not, except for manifest and
reasonable cause, be changed ; unless, for instance, they have
been guilty of dilapidation, or lived incontinently, or have been
guilty of any offence of a like nature for which they shall ap-
pear to deserve to be removed, or if they shall have to be trans-
ferred through the necessity of their filling some higher office.
It seems also proper to be added, that monks 'or black canons,
or black nuns, are not to use coloured hoods, but black ones
only ; and they are to use cloaks of only black or white, with the
skins of lambs, cats, or foxes. Monks also, and other persons
of the religious orders, are not to use hats, or to go away from
their convents on pretence of making pilgrimages. We do
also enact, that in every church of monks, or of any religious
persons canonically appropriated to their use, a vicar shall, un-
der the superintendence of the bishop, be appointed, who shall

receive a fair and sufficient maintenance from the property of
the church. [These, saving in all things the honor and privi-
leges of the Holy Church of Rome.]

In the same year, Octavianus, cardinal bishop of Ostia, and
legate of the Apostolic See, came into France, being sent as
legate a latere by our lord the pope Innocent, in order to en-
quire into the divorce that had taken place between Philip,
king of France, and queen Botilda, his wife, and in the first
place, before entering upon the question, to compel the before-
named king of France to put away his German adulteress, and
to take again his wife Botilda, and treat her in a due and
becoming manner.

This accordingly took place upon the vigil of the Nativity
of the blessed Mary, the Mother of God and ever a Virgin, the
said cardinal and the archbishops, bishops, and clergy of France,
having met at the church of Saint Leodegar, at Nivelle. Thither,
also, came Philip, king of France, and Botilda, his queen, and
his German adulteress ; and the king of France, at the admo-
nition of the said cardinal, and by the advice of his people, jmt
away his adulteress, and took back his queen Botilda; immedl-
~ately after which he made complaint against her to the cardinal,
saying, that legally he ought not to have her for a wife, as
they were too closely connected by consanguinity, and that this
he was prepared in every way to prove ; and he therefore de-
manded that a divorce should be effected between them.

Upon this, the before-named cardinal appointed for them
a space of six months, six weeks, six days, and six hours from
the vigil of the Nativity of the blessed Mary, within which to
deliberate upon the matter, and, at the choice of queen Botilda,
appointed Soissons as the place for trial. On the same day,
that is to say, on the vigil of the Nativity of Saint Mary, after
the king of France had put away his adulteress, and had taken
again his wife Botilda, the sentence of interdict upon the
churches in the kingdom of France was immediately repealed,
arid, the bells ringing, there was great joy among the clergy
and the people, as the interdict had now lasted for more
than thirty weeks, and the bodies of the dead had been buried
outside of the town, along the lanes and streets. Shortly after
this, the woman before mentioned, whom the king of France
had put away, gave birth to a son, who was called Philip, after
the name of his father. The said king of France had also had,
by the same woman, a daughter, who was five years old on the

very day on which, he put her away; which daughter the
king of France promised that he would give in marriage to
Alexander, the son of William, king of Scotland.

In the same year, on the ninth day before the calends of
October, being the last Saturday [of the autumnal fast 68 ] of the
four seasons before the feast of Saint Michael, William, sur-
named Malvoisin, the bishop elect of Glasgow, was ordained
priest at Lyons, by the archbishop of that city ; and on the fol-
lowing day, namely, the Lord's day, being the eighth day before
the calends of October, he was consecrated bishop of Glasgow
by the same archbishop, by order of pope Innocent the Third.

In the month of October, in the same year, after settling his
affairs in Normandy and his other territories beyond sea, John,
king of England, crossed over from Normandy to England,
bringing with him his wife Isabel ; and on the eighth day before
the ides of the said month, being the Lord's day, he and his
wife Isabel were crowned at London, at Westminster, by Hu-
bert, archbishop of Canterbury. In the meantime, by command
of the said king, Geoffrey, archbishop of York, his brother,
was deprived of all the manors and property of his archbishopric.
On this occasion, James de Poterne, who was the then sheriff
of York, violently entering upon the manors of the said
archbishop, made waste of his property ; on which the arch-
bishop excommunicated the said sheriff, and all the authors and
abettors of the said violence, with candles lighted and with
bells ringing. He also excommunicated all who had excited
or wished to excite his brother John to wrath or indignation
against him without any fault on his own part. He also excom-
municated the burgesses of Eeverley, and suspended that town
from the celebration of Divine service, and from the ringing of
bells, because the said burgesses had broken into his park, and
had disturbed and lessened his other possessions, which Roger,
archbishop of York, his predecessor, and he himself, for some
time, had held without molestation.

In process of time, however, John, king of England, following
the advice of prudent men, restored to the before-named arch-
bishop his archbishopric, and named a day for him to come to
court, for the purpose of showing why he had not crossed over
with him, in order to make a treaty with the king of France,
when he had been summoned so to do ; as also, why he had not

permitted his servants to receive the money levied upon the
carucates in his hands, as had been done in other parts of the
kingdom, and why he had beaten one of the servants of the
sheriff of York ; and in order that he might repay to the king
three thousand marks of silver, which he had owed to Richard,
king of England, his brother.

f Immediately after his coronation, John, king of England,

| sent Philip, bishop of Durham, Roger Bigot, earl of Nor-

| folk, Henry de Bohun, earl of Hereford, nephew of "William,

\ king of Scotland, David, earl of Huntingdon, brother of the

1 said king of Scotland, Roger de Lacy, constable of Chester,

| "William de Vesci and Robert de Ros, sons-in-law of the said

| king of Scotland, and Robert Fitz-Roger, sheriff of Northum-

(jberland, to William, king of the Scots, with letters patent from

the king, giving a safe conduct for the purpose of bringing the

said king of the Scots to the king of England, and naming the

morrow of the feast of Saint Edmund as that of his appearance

at Lincoln.

In the meantime, Hugh, bishop of Lincoln, returning to
England from the parts beyond sea, fell ill at London, being
attacked by a quartan ague ; on which John, king of England,
came to visit him, and confirmed his will, and promised him, in
the name of the Lord, that for the future, in his time, he would
ratify all reasonable testaments of prelates of churches. Shortly
after, in the month of November, sixteen days before the ca-
lends of December, being the fifth day of the week, Hugh,
bishop of Lincoln, departed this life at London.

In the same month of November, on the eleventh day before
the calends of December, being the third day of the week,
John, king of England, and William, king of Scotland, had an
interview at Lincoln ; and, on the day after, that is to say, on
the tenth day before the calends of December, being the fourth
day of the week, John, king of England, fearlessly, and con-
trary to the advice of many of his followers, entered the cathe-
dral church of Lincoln, 69 and offered on the altar of Saint John
the Baptist, in the new buildings there, a chalice of gold. After
this, on the same day, he and William, king of the Scots, met for
a conference, outside of the city of Lincoln, upon a lofty hill ;
and there, in sight of all the people, William, king of the Scots,

did homage to John, king of England, as of his own right, and
swore fealty to him, upon the cross of Hubert, archbishop of
Canterbury, for life and limb, and his worldly honor against all
men, and for preserving the peace toward him and his realm,
saving always his own rights, the following being witnesses
thereto : Hubert, archbishop of Canterbury, John, archbishop
of Dublin, Bernard, archbishop of Ragusa, Philip, bishop of
Durham, William, bishop of London, Gilbert, bishop of Ro-
chester, Eustace, bishop of Ely, Savaric, bishop of Bath, Herbert,
bishop of Salisbury, Godfrey, bishop of Winchester, Gilles, bi-
shop of Hereford, John, bishop of Norwich, Roger, bishop of
Saint Andrew's, in Scotland, Henry, bishop of Llandaff, and
Roger, bishop of Bangor; Geoffrey Fitz-Peter, justiciary of
England, earl of Essex, Roger Bigot, earl of Norfolk, Hamelin,
earl of Warenne, Baldwin de Bethune, earl of Aumarle, Wil-
liam, earl of Salisbury, Henry de Bohun, earl of Hereford, the
earl of Clare, the earl of Ferrers, David, brother of William,
king of the Scots, earl of Huntingdon, Roland, son of Uctred,
son of Fergus, prince of the men of Galloway, Patrick, earl of
Lothian, Griffin, son of Rees, king of South Wales, and many
besides, from the kingdom of Scotland ; and in presence of the
following barons of England and Normandy; Roger, constable of
Chester, Eustace de Vesci, Robert de Ros, William de Stute-
ville, Ralph Chamberlain of Tankerville, Warine Fitzgerald,
Stephen de Turnham, and Robert, his brother, Gilbert Basset,
and Thomas and Alan, his brothers, Roger de Huntingfield,
Saier de Quincy, William de Hastings, Jolan de Neville, Simon
de Chancy, Gerard de Camville, and many others of the barons
of England and Normandy.

Accordingly, after doing homage, William, king of Scotland,
demanded of John, king of England, his lord, the whole of
Northumberland, Cumberland, and Westmoreland, as his right
and inheritance ; and after this had been discussed between
them at considerable length, and they could not come to an
agreement, the king of England demanded of the king of Scot-
land a truce, for the purpose of deliberating until Pentecost
next ensuing. This being granted, on the day after, that is to
say, on the ninth day of the calends of December, being the
fifth day of the week, early in the morning, William, king of
the Scots, set out on his return to his own kingdom, under the
safe conduct of the persons before named, who had escorted
him to the king of England.



504 ANNALS OF ROGER DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1200.

On the same day, that is to say, on the ninth day before the
calends of December, the body of Hugh, bishop of Lincoln, was
carried to Lincoln, for the purpose of being buried there ; on
which, John, king of England, and the above-named three arch-
bishops, and thirteen bishops, together with the said earls and
barons, went forth to meet it, and received the body ; and the
king himself, with the earls and barons, carried the body on their
shoulders to the porch of the cathedral church, rejoicing in thus
showing obedience to God and to his blessed minister. At the
door of the church the above-named archbishops and bishops re-
ceived the body, and then it was carried on the shoulders of the
priests into the choir, where it remained for the night. While
the service of the dead was being performed around it, a certain
woman, who for seven years had been blind of one eye, re-
covered her [perfect] sight. There too a certain cut-purse cut
away the purse belonging to a woman, immediately upon which
both his hands became contracted, and he stood motionless,
crying aloud, and saying, 70 " I repent, alas ! if belief is ever
accorded to any of the wretched, I repent, and am tortured by
my deeds. I, who confess that torments still more severe are by
me deserved, though hardly can I endure them more severe. And
yet, although this punishment is merited by my deeds ; still,
great hopes have I in the mercy'of God. Hope it is that makes
even the delver, 71 chained with the fetter, to live on, and to fancy
that from even the iron his legs will be released. Hope it is
that, when on every side no land he sees, makes the ship-
wrecked sailor still strike out in the midst of the waves.
Full oft has the skilful care of the physicians abandoned him,
whom, as the pulse died away, hope did not forsake. Those
in prison fast enclosed are said to look for the day of safety, and
many a one as he hangs on the cross, still breathes forth his
vows. Lo, hope ! how many, when around the neck they have

Roger of Wendover is content to leave him to speak in plain prose only,
and to the following effect. " Pity me, pity me, ye friends of God ; for
I renounce Satan and his works, to whom I have till now been a slave ;
and pray to the Lord for me, that He may not confound me in my peni-
tence, but may rather deal compassionately with me."

tied the noose, has she forbidden to die by the purposed death !
Sometimes at the altar does the violator of the temple take
refuge, nor does he dread to invoke the offended Deity's aid."

Then, returning to himself, he exclaimed, "Be silent, thou
my tongue, nothing more art thou allowed to say." After which,
turning to the clergy, he said, " Pity me, do you, at least, pity
me, ye friends of God, and pray for me unto the Lord, that He
in His ineffable mercy may have mercy unto me. For Satan
and his works I renounce." And immediately, upon prayer
being made for him unto the Lord, the chains of Satan were
loosed, by which his hands had been bound together, and he
was made a whole man from that hour, praising and glorifying
God. "At .praises being given such as thine, do they in
heaven rejoice, that so, what their power is able to effect, by
testimony they may prove. Full oft do they alleviate punish-
ments, and restore the light withdrawn, when they see that a
sin has been sincerely repented of." 72

On the eighth day before the calends of December, being the
sixth day of the week, the body of the said Hugh, bishop of
Lincoln, was, after the solemnity of the mass, carried into the
new church which he himself had founded in honor of the
blessed Mary, the Mother of God and ever a Virgin ; and he
was buried by the before-named archbishops and bishops, near
the altar of Saint John the Baptist. Oh ! how great was the
grief of all, how great their lamentations ! and those of the
clergy in'especial. For he was truthful in word, just in judgment,
force seing in counsel, conspicuous in virtue, and remarkable
for every endowment of manners ; and his life shed a glorious
"i^ht^upon all churches. " The closing day of man must ever
be a\voi fo d, and before his death and the last rites ought no
man to be pronounced happy." 73 For to live is not a glorious
thing, but to live well is the thing to be gloried in.

Also, while John, king of England, was staying at Lincoln,
there came to him twelve abbats of the Cistercian order, and,
falling at his feet, begged for mercy, saying that his foresters

had destroyed their cattle, by which they and the poor of
Christ were sustained, and had driven them away from the
royal pastures and forests ; on which the king made answer,
" Arise." Accordingly, all these men arose, and the king
himself, by the inspiration of the Divine favour, fell on his
face before their feet, asking pardon, and said to them, " My
protection I do give and do grant to you, that you may feed your
cattle in my pastures and forests, in the manner in which the
said privilege is known to have been granted to you by my
predecessors the kings of England ; in addition to which, look
out for some suitable place in my kingdom for you to found
an abbey of your order, and I will build it for the good of my
soul and those of my parents, and for the establishment of my
kingdom, and there, God willing, will I be buried."

In the month of December, in the same year, Roland, prince
of Galloway, died at Northampton, in England, on the four-
teenth day before the calends of January, being the third day
of the week, and was buried there, in the abbey of Saint Andrew.

In the same year, Dunecan, son of Gilbert, the son of Eergus,
carried off Evelina, the daughter of Alan Eitz- Walter, lord of
Renfrew, before the return of William, king of Scotland, from
England into his territories. The king, being greatly enraged
at this, exacted from Alan Eitz-Walter twenty-four hostages,
as pledges that he would keep the peace towards him and
his territories, and that he would exact redress for that
offence.

In the month of September, in the said year, Hugh, bishop
of Lincoln, within fifteen days after his death, appeared, in
his sleep, to Master Roger de Roleston, dean of the church of
Lincoln, and said to him, "Our Lord Jesus Christ has, in His
favour, granted unto me, that one of you my brethren shall before
long come to me to reign with the Lord. Be -ye, therefore, pre-
pared and watch, for ye know not the day nor the hour when
the Lord shall come;" and so saying, he departed. When
the morning came, the before-named dean related this vision
in the chapter- house to the brethren, and they were all with
one mind desiring with great desire to be relieved from the
great burden of the flesh, and to be with Christ. But this
vision was, at this time, fulfilled in one brother only of their
number, Robert Deschapelles. Eor he immediately fell ill,
and, breathing his last within three days, took his departure
unto the Lord. [After his death] his body was found to be

sewed up in sackcloth, from the head to the knees, which he
had been long in the habit of wearing beneath a white gar-
ment.

In the same month of December, a little before the Nativity
of our Lord, there appeared by night, in the province of York,
five moons in the heavens, at about the first watch of the
night. The first appeared in the north, the second in the
south, the third in the west, the fourth in the east, and the
fifth in the middle of the first four, having with it many
stars ; and this latter one, with its stars, made the circuit of
the four moons previously mentioned five or six times. This
phenomenon appeared, in the sight and to the great surprise of
many, for about a period of one hour; after which, it va-
nished from the eyes of those who beheld it.

In the same year, at Mid-Lent, in the month of March, Philip,
king of France, and queen Botilda, his wife, met, with their re-
spective partisans, at Soissons, in the presence of Octavianus, the
bishop of Ostia, the judge-delegate of our lord the pope Inno-
cent. On behalf of the said queen also, there were there
present bishops, and other worthy and discreet men, who had
been sent by Canute, king of the Danes, her brother, and who,
before the commencement of the trial, demanded of the king
of France security to be at liberty to answer and to make
allegations, and to depart from his territories. These being
accordingly granted, the king of France stoutly demanded
that a divorce should take place between himself and Botilda
his wife, saying, that they were so closely connected in the
ties of consanguinity, that he was bound by law to have no
intercourse with her.

To this, the envoys of the king of the Danes made answer
in the following terms: "We both know, have heard, and
have seen, that, -when the venerable men, your envoys, whom
your excellency sent to our lord Canute, the king of the Danes,
for the purpose of contracting a marriage between you and
Botilda, his sister, were in his presence, and had stated that
you had desired, with exceeding great desire, to take to wife
his sister Botilda, a distinguished maiden, and of royal birth,
and urgently requested that she might be sent to you, our
lord Canute, the king of the Danes, the mighty triumpher over
his foes, whom no one with impunity opposes, upon hearing
the opinions of the nobles of his kingdom, thought proper
to listen to your requests. Upon this, your said envoys made

oath upon your soul, and upon their own souls as well, that,
immediately the said Botilda should enter within the limits of
your kingdom, you would have her married to you, and crowned
queen, and would treat her honorably as your wife, so long as
you two should live. And, as to this, you sent unto our mas-
ter, the king of the Danes, your instrument, which we have
here in our hands, and we have the instruments of your nobles
as well, who made oath to the same effect. And inasmuch as
you have treated the before-named Botilda, your wife, other-
wise than as was sworn to by your nobles, we do accuse them
of perjury and of breach of faith in presence of our lord the pope ;
we do also appeal to our lord the pope from the judge here, Oc-
tavianus, the lord bishop of Ostia, who is suspected by us, inas-
much as he is your kinsman by blood, as he admits, and shows
too great favour to your cause." In like manner, also, queen
Botilda herself appealed, in her own behalf, to our lord the
pope. On this, Octavianus, bishop of Ostia, and legate of the
Apostolic See, hearing that appeal was made to the Supreme
Pontiff, said to the envoys of the king of the Danes, " Wait
till such time as my colleague, who has been asssociated with
me by our lord the pope, and who will be here before long, shall
come, and then receive the decision that he shall give." They,
however, took their departure, saying, " We have appealed."

After three days, the other legate arrived, in whose sanctity
and justice our lord the pope had full confidence, and, sitting
in judgment, he found no cause why there should be a divorce
between Philip, king of France, and queen Botilda, his wife;
but when it was his intention to pronounce final sentence
thereon against the king of France, the king, being forewarned
thereof, took his departure before the sentence was pronounced,
taking with him his wife, Botilda, whom he placed in still
closer confinement.

P$*In the same year, this treaty of peace and final reconcilia-
tion was made between Philip, king of France, and John, king
of England :

The final Treaty made between Philip, king of France, and John,
king of England.

" Philip, by the grace of God, king of the Franks, to all to
whom this present writing shall come, greeting. Know ye,
that .this is the form of the treaty of peace made between us and
our dearly beloved and faithful John, by the grace of God, king

of England : that is to say, he will observe the treaty of peace
towards ourselves and our heirs, which king Richard, his brother,
made with ourselves between Chastel Heraud and Charoton ;
with the exception of those things, which in this present instru-
ment are excepted or changed by reason of the exceptions which
the said king Eichard made in the said treaty of peace so con-
cluded with us. And to this further effect ; that the said John
has given to us and to our heirs, as being the right heir of his
brother Richard, the city of Evreux and the Evreusin, with all
the fees and demesnes thereof; in such manner as the under-
written boundaries set forth. The said boundaries are placed
between Neubourg and Evreux. The whole of the land that
shall lie within the said boundaries on the side of France shall
belong to me ; while that which shall be on the side of Neu-
bourg shall belong to the king of England. Also, as much
land as we have extending towards Neubourg, so much shall
we have extending towards Conches, and towards Akemu a
similar extent, in the direction where the abbey of Noa is
situate, according to the course which the river Icogne there
takes. Gurtebo 71 also, as far as it extends, he has given unto
us ; Tiliers, with its appurtenances, and Danville remain in the
hands of the king of England ; also, as much as the lord of
Bruroles shall have (namely, that which he shall be entitled to
have) in the lordship of Tiliers, just so much is the lord of
Tiliers to have (that is, to be entitled to have) in the lord-
ship of Bruroles. He has also granted unto us as much of the
bishopric of Evreux as lies within the said boundaries ; for
which the bishop of Evreux shall be answerable to us and to
our heirs : while the said bishop shall be answerable to the king
of England, and to his heirs, for as much thereof as shall lie
without the said boundaries. Be it also known, that neither
we nor the king of England shall be at liberty to erect fortifi-
cations within the boundaries established between Neubourg and
Evreux, nor yet at Gurtebo, neither we on our side nor the king
of England on his side, except where fortifications have been
already erected within the before-mentioned boundaries. Also,
the fortresses of Fortes and of Landes shall be immediately de-
stroyed, and no fortresses shall be allowed to be rebuilt at the
said places. And further, the king of England has caused the
right heir to Evreux to quit-claim to us of all places which the

74 There is no doubt that many of the names of these small places in
Normandy are corrupt.



510 ANNALS OF EOGER DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1200.

count of Evreux used to hold within the said boundaries. With
regard to Hulcasme, in Normandy, the following shall be the
terms agreed on : the fees and demesne shall remain in the
hands of the said king of England and his heirs, just as the
archbishop of Rouen held the same on the day on which he
made the exchange for Andely ; beyond which the whole of
the Hulcasme belongs to us. Also, we are not to be at liberty to
erect fortifications beyond Jumieges, on our side of Normandy,
nor beyond the borders of the forest of Vernon, but within
the same. The king of England has also given as a marriage
portion to our son Louis, together with his niece, the daughter
of the King of Castille, the fief of Heraud, the fief of Carsarre,
and the fief of Butures, just as Andrew de Calumac held the
same of the king of England ; and of all the same we shall
stand seised until such time as the said marriage shall have
been consummated. And whatever may happen as regards the
said marriage, after the same shall have taken place, we are to
hold the said fiefs all the days of our life ; and after our death,
the said fiefs are to revert to the said king of England and his
heirs, if the before-named Louis, our son, shall not have an
heir by the niece of the king of England. But if the king
of England shall chance to die without an heir by the wife
now married to him, then, together with the fiefs aforesaid,
the king of England shall give to our son Louis, together with
his said niece, by way of marriage portion, the fief of Hugh
de Gournay, on this side of the sea of England, and the fief of
earl Patrick, just as they hold the same of the king of Eng-
land, on this side of the English sea. Also, the king of Eng-
land has given to us thirty thousand marks of silver, full
weight and lawful money, according to the law by which they
were made, that is to say, of the value of thirteen shillings and
four-pence each mark, as an equivalent for our reliefs and our fief
of Brittany, which we have transferred to the king of Eng-
land. King John has also received Arthur as his liegeman, so
that Arthur will hold Brittany of the said king of England.
Also, the said king of England, as being right heir of his bro-
ther, king Eichard, shall hold of us all fiefs in such manner as
his father and king Eichard, his brother, held the same, and in
such manner, as they are entitled to the fiefs, with the excep-
tion of those above mentioned, which remain with us, as before
stated. With regard to the count of Angouleme and the viscount
of Limoges, the said king John shall receive them as his liege-

men, on condition that he will allow them to remain in pos-
session of all their rights. Also, as to the earl of Flanders and
the earl of Boulogne, it shall be thus arranged ; the earl of
Flanders shall hold that which he holds in our territory, and
we shall continue to hold of the earl of Boulogne what we
now hold, that is to say, the demesnes, fiefs, and other things
which are in the hands of the count of Pontigny, which
fiefs and demesnes shall remain to us and to the count of
Pontigny ; and all which the earl of Flanders holds of us, he
shall do homage to us for the same. Also, if the earl of Flan-
ders, or any one of our liegemen, who are or ought to be rather
Hegemen of ourselves than of the king of England, shall attempt
TxTdo us any eviTor injury, the king of England shall not be at
liberty to aid them against us, and to support them, nor we, in
like manner, his liegemen, who are or ought to be rather liege-
men of him than of ourselves, saving always the contents before
mentioned of this present treaty of peace. Among these cove-
nants, the king of England has also made a covenant that he will
give no aid to Otho, either with money or with troops, or with
knights, or in any other way, unless with our consent. As to
Arthur, it is thus arranged, that the king of England shall not
deprive him of the fief or of the demesne of Brittany on this
side the sea of England, except upon the lawful judgment
of his court. The king of England has given us sureties by
his liegemen whose names are underwritten Baldwin, earl of
Aumarle, William, earl of Pembroke, Hugh de Gournay, "Wil-
liam de Humezt, constable of Normandy, Eobert de Harcourt,
John de Pratelles, William de Kay, and Guarine de Capuin who
have made oath to the following effect, that they will come
over to us with all their fiefs on this side the sea, if the king of
England shall not observe this treaty of peace and covenant
as arranged. We also have given sureties by our liegemen,
whose names are underwritten : Eobert, count de Dreux, Geof-
frey, count de Perche, William Garland, Bartholomew de Eoye,
Gervaise de Chastel, Walter Chamberlain, the father, and Urso,
his son, Philip de Leuns, and Walter Chamberlain the younger :
who have in like manner made oath that they will go over to
that king with all their [fiefs] if we shall not observe this
treaty of peace, as the same has been arranged. And further,
we and our pledges before named have sworn strictly and faith-
fully to observe the same in good faith, and without any evil
intent whatsoever. And that this same may be of lasting va-

lidity, we do, by the authority of our seal, confirm^ this'present
instrument. Done at G , 75 in the year from the Incarna-
tion of our Lord 1200, in the month of May."

A similar instrument to the above was received by the king
of France, with the change only of the names.

Customs of the Exchequer as to enquiries into debts due to our
lord the king.

It has been enacted in England, and the same is, by com-
mand of king John, confirmed, that no sheriff shall receive
ajaj_one_at_ the presentation of a baron for a seneschal/ 6 who
cannot be answerable for his amercement consequent on a breach
of faith, if he should chance to be guilty of the same. And in case,
afthe presentation of a baron, a seneschal shall make oath that he
will account to the sheriff for the debts due from his master to
the exchequer, it is to be understood that he is to account for
the debts due according to the computation of the sheriff; and if
he shall not do so, he shall be put in the prison for that purpose
named, according to the laws of the exchequer, and the debt
due to the king shall be levied from the chattels of his master,
in conformity with the laws of the exchequer. If also he shall
not keep the faith to which he has pledged himself, so as not
to appear at the time and place of payment to the sheriff,
or if he shall make his appearance, and shall depart without
leave given, his body shall be seized and placed in the king's
prison for that purpose named, and he shall not be set at
liberty but by the especial command of our lord the king. Also,
persons shaU be sent upon the lands of the master, whose
seneschal has committed the default, and payment shall be
made from out of his chattels of the money which, according
to the law of the exchequer, is due : and if the said money is
due for a fine 77 on land, and chattels are not to be found, then
the land on account of which the fine became due shall be seized
for the use of our lord the king, and be retained until such
time as the money shall be paid in conformity with the law
of the exchequer. As a punishment for his breach of faith the
seneschal who shall have been guilty of such breach, shall never

76 This name here means nothing more than steward.

77 Probably the word " finis," here means the fine paid to the king, as
superior lord, on entering on lands newly acquired by descent or purchase.
It is, perhaps, the same as Spelmau calls " the king's silver."

be believed on his oath as to this or any other sums due what-
ever, nor shall he be received ; 78 nor shall his master be believed,
or to be listened to as to the said debt, unless by favour, and at
the desire of the king, in conformity with the law and custom
of the exchequer.

In the same year, John i _king_ojL_Englan4, sold for five
thousand marks, to William de Braose, the whole of the lands
of Philip de "Worcester, and the whole of the lands of Theo-
BaTOitz-'Waltef, in Ireland. On this, Philip, with difficulty
escaping from the hands of the king, returned into Ireland,
passing through the territories of the king of the Scots, and
recovered part of his lands by waging war [against the king].
Also Theobald Fitz- Walter, by the mediation of Hubert, arch-
bishop of Canterbury, his brother, paid to William de Braose
five hundred marks, in order to regain possession of his lands,
and did homage to him for the same.

Of the Philosopher Secundus and his determined silence.

In 79 the time of Adrian flourished the philosopher Secundus,
who philosophized, keeping silence all the time, and leading
the life of a Pythagorean. 80 For, when a little child, having
been sent there 81 to be taught, he had heard among
the Scots, that every woman is a harlot and unchaste. At
length, becoming perfected in philosophy, he returned to his
country, following the usual customs of a person on a pil-
grimage, carrying a staff and a wallet, with the hair of his
head and his beard growing long. [On his return] he was
entertained in his own house, no one of the servants recog-
nizing him, nor yet his own mother ; and, wishing to prove, as
to women, if what he had heard was true, he called one of
the maid-servants, and promised her ten pieces of gold if she
would induce his mother [to comply with his desires] : on which,
yielding assent to the maid's proposal, she had him introduced
to her in the evening. And whereas she supposed that she was
about to have carnal connexion with him, he embraced her just

78 In the character of steward or seneschal to any lord.

79 How this account of the philosopher Secundus and his maxims came
to he inserted here, or for what purpose, it is impossible to say. It has
nothing to do with the narrative.

80 Probably abstaining from flesh.

81 This was a singular school for the education of a child, in the time
of Adrian or his predecessors.

as though she had been his own mother, and lay upon her
breast until the morning.

When the morning came, and he wished to arise and
depart, she caught hold of him, and said, " It was to try me,
that you did this ;" on which he made answer, " By no means,
madam, my mother ; but it would not have been a proper
thing for me to defile the vessel from which I came forth." On
this she enquired who he was ; when he made answer, " I am
your son Secundus." Accordingly, on considering within her-
self, not being able to bear her alarm, she died from fright.

Secundus, now feeling sensible that it was through his words
that his mother's death had happened, exacted it as a punish-
ment upon himself for, the future not to speak again; he,
accordingly, preserved silence until the day of his death It
so happened, that about the same time the emperor Adrian,
coming to Athens, heard of him, and, sending for him, in the
first place saluted him ; the other, however, remained silent. On
this, Adrian said, "Speak, philosopher, that we may hear
something of thee." He, however, still persevered in his deter-
mined silence ; on which Tyrpon called to a headsman, and
said, " As this person does not choose to speak to the emperor,
we do not choose that he shall live. Take him away, and put
him to the torture." At the last moment, Adrian secretly
took the headsman aside, and said to him, " Speak to him on
the road, and persuade him to speak ; and if at your persuasion
he makes answer, then behead him; but if he makes no
answer, then bring him back to me/'

Accordingly, Secundus was led by the headsman to the place
of torture ; and the headsman said to him, " Secundus, why
dost thou die in silence ? Speak, and thou shalt live." How-
ever, caring but little for life, in silence he awaited death;
and the headsman, leading him to the appointed place, said to
him, " Stretch forth thy neck, and receive the sword thereon : "
on which, he extended his neck, and preferred silence to life.

On this, the headsman took him, and led him to Adrian, tel-
ling him how that Secundus had persisted in his silence even unto
death. Adrian, admiring the firmness of the philosopher, said
to him, " Since this law of silence which thou hast deter-
mined upon can in no way be broken, take that tablet and
write, and at least speak with thy hand." Secundus, then
taking up the tablet, wrote to the following effect : "As for
me, Adrian, I fear thee not, because thou seemest to be the



STORY OF THE PHILOSOPHEK SECUKDTJS. 515

prince of this world ; thou mayest indeed hear me, but thou
hast no power whatever to compel me to use my voice."

Adrian, accordingly, read what he had written,, and said,
" Thou art fully excused. But still I would propose to thee
some questions for thee to answer me thereon ; of which the
first is, 'What is the world?" 3 In answer to this, the other
wrote, "The world is a circle without end, a sightly commo-
dity, a form made of many forms, an eternal course, a revo-
lution without error."

"What is the ocean?" "The embracer of the world, the
encircling limit, the dwelling-place of the rivers, the fountain
of the showers."

" What is God ? " "An immortal mind, an unimaginable
loftiness, a form of many forms, a research that defies investi-
gation, an eye that sleeps not, all-embracing, light, good."

"What is the sun ? " " The eye of the heavens, a circle of
heat, light without setting, the ornament of the day, the dis-
tributor of the hours."

"What is the moon?" "The ornament of the heavens,
the rival of the sun, the enemy of evil-doers, the solace of
wayfarers, the guide of mariners, the signal for solemnities,
the bestower of dew, the presager of tempests."

"What is the earth?" "The foundation of the heavens,
the centre of the universe, the guardian and the mother of
fruits, the cover of hell, the mother of those who are born,
the devourer of all, the store-house of life."

" What is man ?" " A mind incarnate, an apparition for a
season, a looker-on of life, a slave of death, a traveller on his
road, a guest on the spot, a struggling spirit, an abode for a
short season."

"What is beauty?" " A fading flower, a carnal felicity,
an object of desire to mankind."

" What is woman ? " " The confusion of man, an insatiable
beast, a continual anxiety, a never-ceasing strife, the ship-
wreck of an unchaste man, a human slave."

" What is a friend ?" "A desirable name, a man seldom
seen, a refuge in distress, an endless blessing."

" What are riches ? " "A weight of gold, a servant of cares,
an unpleasing delight, an insatiate envy, an ever- craving desire,
an exalted face, a hateful object of desire."

" What is poverty ?" "An odious blessing, the mother of

health, freedom from cares, the refresher of the wise, business
without loss, possession without claim thereon, happiness with-
out anxiety."

" What is old age ? " " A wished-for evil, the death of the
still living, a safe weakness, a living death."

"What is sleep?" " The image of death, a rest from la-
bour, the wish of the sick, the desire of the wretched."

"What is life?" "The delight of the happy, the sorrow
of the wretched, a waiting for death."

" What is death ?" "An eternal sleep, the fear of the rich,
the desire of the poor, an inevitable event, the robber of man,
the flight of life, the dissolution of all things "

"What is a word?" " The betrayer of the mind."
" What is the body ? " " The resting-place of the spirit."
" What is the beard ? " "A distinction of sex."
" What is the brain ? " " The guardian of the memory."
" What is the forehead ? " " The image of the mind."
" What are the eyes ? " " The guides of the body, the ves-
sels of light, the discoverers of the mind."

" What is the heart ? " " The receptacle of life."
" What is the liver ? " " The retainer of heat."
" What is the gall ? " " The producer of anger."
" What is the spleen ? " " The storehouse for laughter and
mirth."

"What is the stomach ? " " The cook of the food."
" What are the bones ? " " The strength of the body."
" What are the feet ? " "A moving foundation."
" What is wind ? " "A disturbance of the air, a movement
of the waters, a dryness of the earth."

" What are rivers ? " "A never-failing course, the refresh-
ers of the sun, the waterers of the earth."

" What is friendship ? " "A wonderful certainty of a thing
unknown."

"What is it that will allow no man, though weary, to de-
sist?" "Gain."

In the year of grace 1201, being the third year of the reign
of king John, the said king was at Guilford, in England, on
the day of the Nativity of our Lord, which fell on the second
day of the week. On the same day, William, king of the
Scots, was at Lanark, in his territories. On the same day, Otho,
king of the Germans, nephew of John, king of the English, was
crowned at Mentz. After the Nativity of our Lord, on the

fifth day before the ides of January, there was a great earth-
quake in England, at York, and in the neighbourhood. After
the Nativity of our Lord, John, king of England, came to Lin-
coln, but he could not come to an agreement with the canons
of the church of Lincoln as to the election of a bishop. For
the king wished to make an election according to his own
pleasure, and the canons also wished to be at liberty to elect ;
which, however, the king would not concede to them.

In the same year, in the month of January, on the day of
the Conversion of Saint Paul, being the fifth day of the week,
John, king of England, crossed over the river Humber, and
came to Cottingham, and was entertained by "William de
Stuteville ; and on the next day he came to Beverley, where,
being induced by a sum of money so to do, he made a stay with
John Le Gros, who had been excommunicated by Geoffrey, arch-
bishop of York ; and when the canons of Beverley wished to
receive him with a procession and the ringing of bells, he re-
fused to be so received, and would not allow them to be rung.
On his departure from Beverley, Henry des Chapelles, a ser-
vant of Geoffrey, archbishop of York, was seized and thrown
into prison, because he would not allow the king to take any
of the archbishop's wines. The said king also gave orders that
all the servants of the archbishop of York, wherever they
might be found, should be arrested ; which was accordingly
done.

In the month of February, at the Purification of Saint Mary,
JoKn, king of England, and queen Isabel, his wife, were at
Scarborough, from which place the king proceeded as far as
the borders of his kingdom, and went through the land, and
put the subjects of his kingdom to their ransom, that is to say,
compelled them to pay fines ; charging them with having laid
waste his forests. When he had come to Extoldesham, he
heard that at Choresbridge there was a treasure concealed, on
which he made people dig there ; but nothing was found beyond
some stones, sealed with brass, iron, and lead.

In the same year, at the vigil of the Purification of Saint
Mary, William, bishop of Glasgow, landed at Dover, in Eng-
land, on his return from his consecration. In the same year,
immediately after the Purification of Saint Mary, Philip, bishop
of Durham, crossed over between Dover and Witsand, for the
purpose of going on a pilgrimage to Saint Jago.

In the same year, between the Nativity of our Lord and the

beginning of the fast, Roderic and Machdunlef were slain in
Ulster, in a barn belonging to the White Monks, by the ser-
vants of John de Courcy, the said John not knowing thereof, as
it is said ; and, after he heard of it, he was very sorry, and, for
this crime, sent the murderers into banishment.

At Mid-Lent, John, king of England, and queen Isabel, his
wife, were at York, and Geoffrey, archbishop of York, made
his peace with the king on payment of a pecuniary fine, upon
the understanding that, by the decision of four bishops and
four barons, elected on behalf of the king and on behalf of
the archbishop, amends should be made for the faults com-
mitted by either side. Here also, William de Stuteville and
James de Poterne, whom the archbishop had excommunicated,
received absolution from him.

In the meantime, Reginald Arundel, praecentor of the church
of York, departed this life ; on hearing of which, Geoffrey,
archbishop of York, wished to give the praecentorship to one
of his own people, but the dean and chapter would not allow
thereof, but, against the will of the archbishop, gave to Hugh
Murdac the archdeaconry of Cleveland, which the said bishop
had the day before given to Master Ralph de Kime, his own
ofiicer ; and, when the archbishop wanted to instal him in place
of the praecentor, the dean said to him, " You have no right to
instal any one, and you shall not instal him ; for, by the autho-
rity of the council of Lateran, we have given away this arch-
deaconry." As the archbishop could not succeed according to
his wishes, he proceeded to excommunicate Hugh Murdac.

In the meantime, Honorius, archdeacon of Richmond, pro-
ceeded to Rome, on account of the injuries which Geoffrey,
archbishop of York, had done him ; he having, contrary to the
ancient dignities of the archdeaconry of Richmond and the
customs thereof, laid claim to the right of institution to
churches and the synodals. Por the archbishop alleged that
the said Honorius had resigned all these things to him, and,
by his charter, confirmed the same. This Honorius in every
way contradicted, and made complaint to pope Innocent of the
injuries which the archbishop of York had done him, and. ob-
tained from him a letter to the following effect :

The Letter of pope Innocent to Geoffrey, archbishop of York.

" Innocent, the bishop, servant of the servants of God, to
the archbishop of York, health and the Apostolic benediction.



A.D. 1201. LETTER OF POPE INNOCENT. 519

If you recognized the authority of the Apostolic See, and
the reverence due to the same, you would not presume in any
way to derogate from the fulness of its power, and the privileges
of its dignity, inasmuch as, you, who have been set apart by
her to share her anxieties, have more frequently found her acting
as your assistant in the emergencies into which, in your rash-
ness, you had brought yourself. For you cannot excuse your-
self, as you ought to have been able to do, on the ground that
you were ignorant of that privilege, by which the means of ap-
pealing to the Apostolic See lie open to all who have been un-
justly aggrieved, inasmuch as you yourself have sometimes ap-
pealed to our presence, and from grievances committed by you,
appeal has been made to us, not once only, but many times, so
that it is not possible for you to be ignorant of the said privi-
lege. But, to let alone other considerations, if on this ground
only, you ought to have abstained from all molestation of those
subject to you, when they invoked our name, because, in many
and arduous emergencies, you have both asked and obtained that
favour should be shown to you by the Apostolic See. But, as
the result of circumstances sufficiently shows, you neither regard
our authority, nor recognize the favour that has been shown to
you, nor do you pay any deference to appeals which are inter-
posed, by those aggrieved, to the Apostolic See. For instance,
when our beloved son, Master Honorius, the archdeacon of Eich-
mond, being in full possession of the liberties of the archdea-
conry of Eichmond, had, together with his clerks, appealed from
you to the Apostolic See, by reason of manifest grievances and
various injuries, you nevertheless pronounced upon him, and
some of his clerks, sentence of suspension, and upon some
churches in the same archdeaconry you pronounced sentence of
interdict. And, not content with this indiscretion, after he had
set out on his journey for the purpose of coming to the Apos-
tolic See, suspending some of his clerks, and laying an interdict
upon their churches, and excommunicating others, (in deed
only, for of right you could not,) you extorted from the rest a
certain sum of money, disturbing and molesting, in many re-
spects, his state of quiet, as also that of his clerks. Wherefore,
because we neither will, nor ought to, leave the excesses of
such great presumption uncorrected, we do, by these Apos-
tolic writings, enjoin and command your brotherhood, of your-
self, to correct such matters as have been previously mentioned,
in order that you may not compel us to be incensed against
you to a greater degree, having hitherto borne with your

temerity on so many occcasions. Otherwise, know that we
have, by our writings, sent word and enjoined our venerable
brother, the bishop of Ely, and our dearly-beloved son, the
abbat of Waltham, that they are to denounce the aforesaid
sentences of excommunication, suspension, and interdict, in
such manner pronounced by you, as being null and void, and, on
pain of ecclesiastical censure, all power of appeal removed, to
compel you to make restitution of all that which you have ex-
torted either from the clerks or from the churches of the said
archdeaconry, after appeal to ourselves lawfully interposed, as
also compensation for their losses sustained ; and whatever
they shall find left unchanged by you or your people, to the pre-
judice of him or of his people, they are, relying upon our
authorization, to replace in its former state ; and are, by means
of the stringent measures before stated, to prevent you from un-
justly molesting the archdeacon or his clerks, or presuming to
disturb their quiet or their liberties ; and you shall know for
certain that it is a hard thing for you to kick against the pricks,
unless you abstain from conduct of this nature, and reverently
pay obedience to our mandates. If otherwise, we shall proceed
still further, perchance, to lay our hands upon you more hea-
vily than you apprehend, that so your excesses may not be
laid to our charge. Given at the Lateran, on the third day be-
fore the nones of February, in the [fourth j 82 year of our pontifi-
cate."

In the same year, that is to say, in the year from the Incar-
nation of our Lord 1201, being the third year of the reign of
John, king of England, the said king, and queen Isabel, his wife,
were crowned at Canterbury, by Hubert, archbishop of Can-
terbury, in the cathedral church there, on Easter day, which
fell on the ninth day before the calends of April, being the
feast of the Annunciation of our Lord, in presence of John,
archbishop of Dublin, William, bishop of London, Gilbert,
bishop of Rochester, Eustace, bishop of Ely, and John, bishop
of Norwich.

Shortly after Easter, the king issued commands that the
earls and barons of England should, at Pentecost, be at Ports-
mouth^ ready, with their horses and arms, to cross over with
him. Eor_ the men of Poitou had prevailed against the guar-
dians of his territories, and had laid siege to his castles, and Gu-
arine de Clapion, the seneschalof Normandy, had, by command
ofhis lord, John, kingof England, laid siege to the castle of Drien-
court, which Richard, king of England, had given to Ralph

de Issoudon, count de Auche, brother of Hugh Le Brun. But,
on hearing of the approach oFthe king of England, Thilip,
king of France, raised all the aforesaid sieges, before the king
of England had arrived in Normandy.

In the meantime, the earls of England met to hold an inter-"
view 83 between them at Leicester, and, by common consent,
sent word to the king that they would not cross over with him.
unless he_ should restore to them their rights. On this, the
king, following bad advice, demanded possession of their cas-
tles, and, beginning with William d'Aubigny, demanded of
him the castle of Beauvoir ; on which the said William satisfied
him by delivering his son as a hostage, and so retained posses-
sion of his castle.

In the same year, William de Stuteville was appointed by
the king sheriff of York. In the same year, Philip, bishop of
Durham, on his road to Saint Jago, was, on Easter-day, at
Saint John d' Angely, where the head is kept of Saint John the
Baptist, which Herod caused to be cut off in prison, and gave
in a charger to the dancing-girl, the daughter of Herodias,
his wife. On the same day, William, king of the Scots, was at
Karel, in Scotland.

In the same year, pope Innocent the Third reigning in the
city of Rome, Saphadin, the brother of Saladin, in the Holy
City of Jerusalem, Alexander, 84 the fratricide, in the city of Con-
stantinople, Leo in Armenia, Aimeric de Lusignan in the cities
of Tyre and Sidon, and in Acre, and the Isle of Cyprus, Ray-
mond being prince of the city of Antioch, Otho, brother of
Henry, duke of Saxony, being, in Germany, elected emperor of
the Romans, Philip reigning in France, John in England, Swere
Birkebain in Norway, Canute in Denmark, William in Scot-
land, Gurthred in the Isle of Man, and John de Courcy in
Ulster, our learned men declared that the old dragon was let
loose, which is the same as the Devil and Satan, saying, "Woe,
woe to those who dwell upon the earth, inasmuch as the old
dragon is let loose, which is the Devil and Satan !" according
to what was said by Saint John the Apostle and Evangelist,
who at the [last] Supper reclined upon the breast of the Lord,
and who drank the streams of the Gospel from the sacred spring
itself of the breast of the Lord : "I, John, saw an angel come
down from heaven, having the keys of the bottomless pit, and

522 ASXALS OF BOGER DE HOTEDEN. A.D. 1201.

a great chain in his hand ; and he laid hold on the dragon, that
old serpent, which is the Devil and Satan, and bound him a
thousand years, and cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut
him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the
nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled ;
and after that, he must be loosed a little season." 85 Accordingly,
our learned men asserted that these thousand years were now
fulfilled, and that the Devil was loosed. Woe unto the earth
and to the inhabitants thereof, for if the Devil, when bound, has
brought so many evils upon the world, how many and how
great will he bring when loosed ? Let us, therefore, suppli-
antly pray to God, that in our daily actions He will preserve
us from evil that He will check and curb our tongues that
the dreadful din of strife may not resound that He will pro-
tect and cherish our perception that He will not allow us to
follow after vanity that the inmost recesses of our hearts may
be pure that folly may be removed afar that moderation in
food and drink may destroy the pride of the flesh that, when
Christ, the Judge, shall come, at the end of the world, He will
make us sharers in joy everlasting.

In the month of May, in the same year, on the vigil of the
Ascension of our Lord, Walter de Ghent departed this life, the
first abbat of the canons regular of the holy Cross at Waltham.
In the same year, in the week of Pentecost, when the barons
of England were assembled at Portsmouth, for the purpose of
crossing over with the king, the king received from each of
them the sum of money which they had intended to expend in
his service, and allowed them to return home ; after which,
he sent before him into Normandy, William Marshal, earl of
Striguil, with a hundred knights, and Roger de Lacy, constable
of Chester, with another hundred knights, in order to make
head against the attacks of his enemies upon the territories of
Normandy. The king also gave to Hubert de Burgh, his cham-
berlain, a hundred knights, and made him keeper of the marches
of England and Wales.

After this, the said king remitted his wrath against Geoffrey,
archbishop of York, and restored him his manors and his servants,
whom he set at liberty, and by his charter confirmed to him
the liberties of the church of York, and of its archbishopric,
in such manner as Roger, archbishop of York, had held the
same. In return for the said confirmation, the said arch-
* Rev. xx. 1-3,

bishop engaged to pay to the king, in the course of one year,
one thousand marks sterling, and for the performance thereof,
the said archbishop pledged his barony to the king.

Shortly after, the king of England sent Geoffrey, bishop of
Chester, Eichard Malebise, and Henry Pudsey to "William,
king of the Scots, and requested that the time for giving an
answer to the demand he had made of the county of Northum-
berland, which the king of England had fixed at Pentecost,
might be put off till the feast of Saint Michael. The king of
England, and queen Isabel, his wife, then embarked and crossed
over, in the second week of Pentecost ; but the king landed
in the Isle of Wight, while the queen, his wife, embarking in
another ship, and having a fair wind, landed in Normandy.

After he had stayed some days longer in England, king John
again went on board ship at Portsmouth, and crossed over to Nor-
mandy; immediately upon which, a^cpnference was held between
him and the king of Trance, near the isle of Andely, and they
came to a full agreement, no one but themselves being aware of
what passed at the interview between them. Three days after
this, at the invitation of the king of France, king John went
to Paris, and was lodged in the palace of the king of France,
and honorably entertained ; the king of France having removed
to take up his dwelling in another quarter. On his departure
thence, the king of England proceeded to Chinon ; while here,
Berengaria, the former queen of England, and wife of king
Richard, came to him ; on which, John, king of England, made
satisfaction to her for her dowry, in conformity with the testi-
mony of Philip, bishop of Durham, and others who had been
present at her marriage.

In the meantime, pope Innocent, having the bowels of com-
passion for the afflicted, wrote to the prelates of the churches
to the following effect :

The Letter of pope Innocent on giving aid to the land of
Jerusalem.

" Innocent, the bishop, servant of the servants of God, to his
venerable brethren, the archbishop and bishops throughout the
kingdom of England appointed, health and the Apostolical bene-
diction. Our just and merciful God, who reproves and chas-
tens those whom He loves, forgets neither to show mercy, nor
does He withhold His compassion in His wrath. Although He
spares not the rod, that He may not seem to hate His sons,



524 ANNALS OF ROGEH DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1201.

still, so does He moderate the severity of His just judgments
against those who offend, that He scourges not so as to destroy,
but, as it were, by His scourges to raise those who are fallen ;
wishing not for the death of sinners, but rather that they may
be converted and live, as there is more joy among the angels
of God over one sinner that repenteth, than over ninety-nine
just persons who need not repentance. For, inasmuch as
the senses of all men are prone to evil from their youth up-
wards, and human nature is more inclined to sin, in order
that, if exalted only by prosperity, they may not wax proud
and their pride may ever hold the ascendancy over them,
He allows them to be humbled, that so, when they shall
feel sensible that they are afflicted acording to their deserts,
they may recognize the justice of the judge, and, washing
away the faults of their repentance with their tears, may be
turned unto the Lord, and the Lord may be turned unto them ;
a thing which in the depopulation of the Eastern lands may
readily be perceived by all. For when men who had now
grown old in the world, had grown old in well-doing as well,
and young men, like boys, had waxe$ wanton in the paths of
vice, for now these hundred years past, and, almost all, like sheep
going astray, being given up to the lusts of the flesh, wandered,
every one his own way, the Lord willed by the loss of the pro-
vince of Jerusalem, so to punish our misdeeds, as, by renewing in
some measure the mystery of His passion, to open a gate to
repentance, and a way unto us to salvation. For He who in
his body suffered for our sins upon the Cross of wood, once again
suffering crucifixion on that wood for the remission of our
sins, allowed himself, as it were, to be afflicted, in suffering the
Cross upon which our Salvation hung, and which He stained
with His own blood, to be taken by the Saracens, and to be so
long held in their possession, that He might see if any one
would grieve at his griefs ; if there should be any one to seek
that his body should be given up to him ; if there should be any
one to wrap it in a napkin, and to place it in the sepulchre, and,
when deposited in the tomb, to place thereupon spices of sweet-
smelling savour. But we rejoice in the Lord that He who
gave the cause for repentance, has also bestowed upon many
the feelings of repentance, and has in His mercy inspired them
with a wish, assuming the sign of the Cross, to avenge the
injuries done to Jesus Christ, fulfilling the precept of the
Gospel, 'If any man will come after me, let him deny himself,



A.D. 1201. LETTER OF POPE INNOCENT. 525

and take up his cross and follow me :' 8R that so, leaving behind
the burden of its hump, the camel may pass through the eye
of the needle, and the rich man, becoming poor, may enter the
kingdom of heaven, and may for things temporal receive the
things eternal. But because many, as we have heard, and
with grief we mention it, have gone back and have laid aside
the emblem of the Cross, that they may not appear to have
come in vain, if they do not perform that which they intended,
we do by these Apostolic writings strictly command and
enjoin your brotherhood, all indulgences to the contrary not-
withstanding (in case it should appear that there have been
surreptitiously obtained any such from our predecessors), that
you are to compel all such to assume the sign of the Cross,
after due warning given, by means of sentence of excommu-
nication and interdict, all power of appeal being withdrawn ;
and that you are on each Lord's day and on festivals, with bells
ringing and candles lighted, stating the names of those of
whom you have or shall have notice, publicly to denounce
the same as excommunicated, and to forbid Divine service
to be celebrated in their presence wheresoever they shall
come. You are also strictly to warn all who have received
the sign of the Cross, and, if it shall be necessary, by ec-
clesiastical rigour to compel them, at the time at which
our dearly beloved sons, those noble men the earls of Flan-
ders, Champagne, and Blois, and the others, shall, after pru-
dent deliberation, by the advice of the wise, have deter-
mined, during the ensuing summer, to perform their intended
pilgrimage, to the end that, in the way which shall be
considered to be most conducive to the interests of the Holy
Land, they may together pay their obedience unto the Lord.
The punishment, also, which we command to be inflicted
upon those who have laid aside the sign of the Cross, in order
to compel them to resume the same, you are, in like form,
to inflict upon those who, within the next five years, shall
presume to frequent tournaments, and are not to revoke the
sentence which you shall have pronounced on such persons,
until they shall have solemnly abjured tournaments for the
said period, that so the blood that should be consecrated to the
Lord, and whereby, at these times, a heavenly reward may easily
be obtained, may not be shed unto devils, to the injury of
the body and the danger of the soul. Each of you in his dio-

cese is healthfully to remind the members thereof thus to do,
and diligently to exhort them, frequently explaining to them
the tenor of the Apostolical remission, to assume the sign of the
vivifying Cross, in order that at least they may, with their
property, according to their means, give some assistance to
the Holy Land ; lest, if they shall, in this moment of emer-
gency, refuse to assist Christ, they may now and hereafter in
vain ask for assistance at His hands. Also, as to all these mat-
ters, brother of Canterbury, we do appoint you our delegate,
diligently to arouse the negligent to the performance of the
same. We do further strictly enjoin and command you, that,
in accordance with the commands which, in our other letters, we
have given you, you will, each of you, in his respective diocese,
urgently demand the fortieth part of all the revenues of
churches and ecclesiastical persons, and of the incomes of clerks,
and, after obtaining it, diligently collect the same, and, after
collecting it, have the same trustily kept, without any diminu-
tion thereof, to be laid out in giving assistance to the Holy
Land; and so fulfil the Apostolic mandate, that, from your
works we may perceive your obedience, and may fully under-
stand how you proceed as regards others in this emergency, not
s-o much your own as of Christ. Given at the Lateran, on the
third day before the nones of May, in the fourth year of our
pontificate."

In the same year, Eustace, abbat of Elaye, returned to Eng-
land, and preaching therein the word of the Lord from city to
city, and from place to place, forbade any person to hold a
market of goods on sale upon the Lord's day. For he said
that the commandment under- written, as to the observance of
the Lord's day, had come down from heaven.

On the observance of the Lord's day.

" The holy commandment as to the Lord's day, which came
from heaven to Jerusalem, and was found upon the altar of
Saint Simeon, in Golgotha, where Christ was crucified for the
sins of the world. The Lord sent down this Epistle, which
was found upon the altar of Saint Simeon, and after looking
upon which, three days and three nights, some men fell upon
the earth, imploring mercy of God. And after the third hour,
the Patriarch arose, and Acharias, the archbishop, and they
opened the scroll, and received the holy Epistle from God. And
when they had taken the same they found this writing therein :



A. D. 1201. ON THE OESEE VANCE OF THE LOKD's DAT. 527

' I am the Lord, who commanded you to observe the holy day of
the Lord, and ye have not kept it, and have not repented of your
sins, as I have said in my Gospel, * Heaven and earth shall pass
away, but my words shall not pass away.' 87 "Whereas I caused
to be preached unto you repentance and amendment of life, you
did not believe me, I have sent against you the pagans, who
have shed your blood on the earth ; and yet you have not be-
lieved ; and, because you did not keep the Lord's day holy, for
a few days you suffered hunger, but soon I gave you fulness, and
after that you did still worse again. Once more, it is my will,
that no one, from the ninth hour on Saturday until sunrise on
Monday, shall do any work except that which is good. And if
any person shall do so, he shall with penance make amends for
the same. And if you do not pay obedience to this command,
verily, I say unto you, and I swear to you, by my seat and by
my throne, and by the cherubim who watch my holy seat,
that I will give you my commands by no other Epistle, but I
will open the heavens, and for rain I will rain upon you stones,
and wood, and hot water, in the night, that no one may take pre-
cautions against the same, and that so I may destroy all wicked
men. This do I say unto you ; for the Lord's holy day, you
shall die the death, and for the other festivals of my Saints
which you have not kept : I will send unto you beasts that
have the heads of lions, the hair of women, the tails of camels,
and they shall be so ravenous that they shall devour your flesh,
and you shall long to flee away to the tombs of the dead, and
to hide yourselves for fear of the beasts; and I will take
away the light of the sun from before your eyes, and will send
darkness upon you, that not seeing, you may slay one another,
and that I may remove from you my face, and may not show
mercy upon you. For I will burn the bodies and the hearts of
you, and of all of those who do not keep as holy the day of
the Lord. Hear ye my voice, that so ye may not perish in
the land, for the holy day of the Lord. Depart from evil, and
shew repentance for your sins. For, if you do not do so, even
as Sodom and Gomorrah shall you perish. Now, know ye,
that you are saved by the prayers of my most holy Mother,
Mary, and of my most holy angels, who pray for you daily.
I have given unto you wheat and wine in abundance, and
for the same ye have not obeyed me. For the widows and
orphans cry unto you daily, and unto them you show no mercy.
8 < St. Matt. xxiv. 35. St. Mark xiii. 31. Su Luke xxi. 33.



528 ANNALS OF EOGEE DE HOVEDEN. A. D. 1201.

The pagans show mercy, but you show none at all. The trees
which bear fruit, I will cause to be dried up, for your sins ;
the rivers and the fountains shall not give water. I gave unto
you a law in Mount Sinai, which you have not kept. I gave
you a law with mine own hands, which you have not observed.
For you was I born into the world, and my festive day ye knew
not. Being wicked men, ye have not kept the Lord's day of
my resurrection. By my right hand I swear unto you, that if
you do not observe the Lord's day, and the festivals of my
Saints, I will send unto you the pagan nations, that they may
slay you. And still do you attend to the business of others,
and take no consideration of this ? For this will I send against
you, still worse beasts, who shall devour the breasts of your
women. I will curse those who on the Lord's day have
wrought evil. Those who act unjustly towards their bre-
thren, will I curse. Those who judge unrighteously the poor
and the orphans, upon the earth, will I curse. For me you
forsake, and you follow the prince of this world. Give heed
to my voice, and you shall have the blessing of mercy. But you
cease not from your bad works, nor from the works of the
devil. Beause you are guilty of perjuries and adulteries, there-
fore the nations shall surround you, and shall, like beasts, de-
vour you."

Accordingly, Eustace, the lord abbat of Flaye, came to York,
and, being honorably received by Geoffrey, the archbishop of
York, and the clergy and people of the city, preached the word
of the Lord, and on the breaking of the Lord's Day and the other
festivals, and imposed upon the people penance and gave absolu-
tion, upon condition that in future they would pay due reverence
to the Lord's Day and the other festivals of the Saints, doing
therein no servile work, and that on the Lord's Day they would
hold no market of things on sale, but devoutly attend to good
works and to prayer. This ordinance he appointed to be ob-
served from the ninth hour on Saturday until sunrise on Monday.

Upon this, the people who were dutiful to God, at his
preaching, vowed before God that, for the future, on the
Lord's Day, they would neither buy nor sell any thing, un-
less, perchance, victuals and drink to wayfarers. They also
vowed, that from each five shillings' worth of such things as
they might sell, they would give one farthing towards buying
lights for the church and the burial of the poor. And, for the col-
lection of these sums, the said abbat directed that in each church



A.D. 1201. DIVINE JUDGMENTS ON BREAKERS OF THE LOPJ)'s DAY. 529

a hollow chest should be placed, under the care of two or three
trustworthy men, into which the people might throw the
money before mentioned. The said abbat also appointed that
an alms' -dish should be placed every day upon the tables of
the rich, in which they might place a part of their victuals for
the benefit of the poor, who had nothing of their own. The
said abbat also forbade any person to buy or sell any thing, or
to plead causes, in churches or in the porches thereof.

Accordingly, through these and other warnings of this holy
man, the enemy of mankind being rendered envious, he put it
into the heart of the king and of the princes of darkness to com-
mand that all who should observe the before-stated doctrines,
and more especially all those who had discountenanced the
markets on the Lord's Day, should be brought before the king's
court of justice, to make satisfaction as to the observance of the
Lord's Day. But our Lord Jesus Christ, whom it is better to
obey than man, and who, by His Nativity, and Resurrection, and
Advent, and by sending the Holy Ghost upon His disciples,
rendered glorious this day, which we, accordingly, name the
Lord's Day, and hallowed it as being the most distinguished,
aroused the miraculous powers of His might, and thus mani-
fested the same against some breakers of the Lord's Day.

One Saturday, a certain carpenter of Beverley, who, after the
ninth hour of the day was, contrary to the wholesome advice of
his wife, making a wooden wedge, fell to the earth, being struck
with paralysis. A woman also, a weaver, who, after the ninth
hour, on Saturday, in her anxiety to finish a part of the web,
persisted in so doing, fell to the ground, struck with paralysis,
and lost her voice. At Rafferton also, a vill belonging to
Master Roger Arundel, a man made for himself a loaf and baked
it under the ashes, after the ninth hour on Saturday, and ate
thereof, and put part of it by till the morning, but when he
broke it on the Lord's Day, blood started forth therefrom ; and
he who saw it bore witness, and his testimony is true.

At Wakefield also, one Saturday, while a miller was, after
the ninth hour, attending to grinding his corn, there suddenly
came forth, instead of Hour, such a torrent of blood, that the
vessel placed beneath was nearly filled with blood, and the
mill-wheel stood immoveable, in spite of the strong rush of the
water; and those who beheld it wondered thereat, saying, "Spare
us,0 Lord, spare thy people!" Also, in Lincolnshire a woman
had prepared some dough, and taking it to the oven after the

ninth hour on Saturday, she placed it in the oven,which was then
at a very great heat; but when she took it out, she found it raw,
on which she again put it into the oven, which was very hot; and,
both on the next day, and on Monday, when she supposed that
she should find the loaves baked, she found raw dough. In the
same county also, when a certain woman had prepared her
dough, intending to carry it to the oven, her husband said to
her, "It is Saturday, and is now past the ninth hour, put it
one side till Monday;" on which the woman, obeying her
husband, did as he had commanded : and so, having covered over
the dough with a linen cloth, on coming the next day to look
at the dough, to see whether it had not, in rising, through the
yeast that was in it, gone over the sides of the vessel, she found
there the loaves ready made by the Divine will, and well baked,
without any fire of the material of this world. This was a
change wrought by the right hand of Him on high.

And yet, although by these and other miracles of His might,
the Lord Almighty invited the people to the observance of the
Lord's day, still, the people, fearing more the royal and human
favour than the Divine, and fearing those who kill the body, but
are able to do no more, rather than Him, who, after he has killed
the body, has power to send the soul to hell, and fearing more
to lose the earthly things than the heavenly, and things tran-
sitory than things eternal, have, oh shame ! like a dog to his
vomit, returned to the holding of markets on the Lord's day.

In the same year, Hugh Bardolph, and some others of the
king's justices, came to the fair of Saint Botolph, intending to
seize in the king's name the woollen cloths that were not two
ells in width between the lists, in conformity with the assize
of king Richard. On hearing of this, the dealers prevailed
with the judges before mentioned that their cloths should not
1)0 seized, and that the said assize of king Richard should be
no longer observed, either as to the width of cloth or the mea-
sure of corn, and that they might be allowed in future to make
their cloths wide or narrow, just as they pleased. On this
occasion, to the injury of many, 88 the said justices obtained a
large sum of money for the king. " Base means of gain ought
to be'shamed." 89

In the same year, John, king of England, making satisfaction
to queen Berengaria, widow of his brother Richard, king of Eng-

88 Who were afterwards cheated by the dealers.

89 " Vitanda est turpis lucri causa."

land, for her dowry, gave her the city of Bayeux, with its
appurtenances, and two castles in Anjou, to hold the same for
life, with a yearly payment of one thousand marks sterling, of
which she was to receive each year five hundred marks, at the
king's exchequer at London, and another five hundred marks
at Caen, in Normandy. This was done at Chinon, in presence of
Elias, archbishop of Bordeaux, and Philip, bishop of Durham.

In the same year, Hubert, archbishop of Canterbury, being
on Saint Bartholomew's day at Westminster, in London, com-
manded all his suffragans, in virtue of their obedience, and in
the name of our lord the pope, to make diligent enquiry through-
out their respective dioceses, and if they should find any per-
sons who had abandoned their vows to assume the cross, to make
them resume the same, and to depart on their pilgrimage, appoint-
ing as the time for them to resume the cross, at the very latest,
the feast of Saint Martin next ensuing, and as the time for
their setting out, the Purification of Saint Mary next ensuing.

In the same year died Theobald, count of Champagne, leaving
as his heir an only daughter, whom he had by Blanche, his wife,
sister of Berengaria, queen of England. In the same year
died the German woman, the daughter of Genest, the wife of
Philip, king of France, whom pope Innocent, in his letters, called
an adulteress ; and by whom the said king had a son and a
daughter ; which daughter the said king of France promised
that he would give in marriage to Alexander, son of the king
of Scotland.

In the same year died Constance, the mother of Arthur, duke
of Brittany. In this year, also, died Margaret, mother of the
said Constance, sister of William, king of the Scots, and mother
of Henry de Bohun, earl of Hereford. In the same year, also,
died Eobert, prior of the church of Beverley, whose office Geof-
frey, archbishop of York, conferred on Morgant, his brother, a
son of king Henry, as was said, in spite of the appeal of Simon,
dean of the church of York, who said that the same priorate
had been given to him by the said archbishop, while the before-
named prior Robert was still alive.

In the same year, Philip, bishop of Durham, returned to
England from Saint Jago, having performed his pilgrimage.
In the same year, John of Salerno, cardinal priest, titular of
Saint Stephen in Monte Celi, and legate of the Apostolic See
in Scotland, Ireland, and the islands adjacent, came to York.
Although he had been one of the two selected for the office of



532 AXNALS OF KOGER DE HOVEDEK. A.D. 1201.

Roman Pontiff after the decease of pope Celestinus, he declined
the election, although ten cardinals would have agreed to his
election ; and he, with the other cardinals, elected Lothaire,
cardinal deacon, Pontiff of Rome, under the name of pope Inno-
cent the Third.

The said John never ate flesh, nor did he drink wine or cider,
or any thing with which he might become intoxicated ; but
for gold and silver he had a considerable thirst. In presence
of this cardinal, Geoffrey, archbishop of York, made offer to
Simon, the dean, and to the chapter, of York, to abide by his
judgment as to all the matters in dispute between them ; sav-
ing always the dignities and privileges of either party, and
saving their rights. But this single expression " saving
their rights" was burdensome and insupportable to them,
whom the knowledge of their own doings accused ; and they
used every endeavour that the clause " saving their rights"
might be expunged.

In the same year, in order that the peace might be more
lasting between Philip, king of France, and John, king of
England, it was enacted, and by writing confirmed, that if the
king of France should in any way break the peace which he
had made with the king of England, the barons of France,
whom he had given as sureties for the observance of the treaty
of peace, being released, with all their men, from fealty to the
king of France, should go over to the king of England, in
order to aid him against the king of France ; and that it should
be the same as to the barons of the king of 'England, whom he
had given as sureties for the preservation of the peace, and that
they should become subject to the king of France, together with
their men, being released from their fealty to the king of Eng-
land, if that king should commit a breach of the peace.

In the same year, "Walter de Lacy, a powerful man in Ire-
land, had an interview with John de Courcy, lord of Ulster, and,
attempting by treachery to seize him, slew many of his people.
Upon this, when the said John had taken to flight, Hugh de
Lacy, the brother of the before-named Walter, said to him :
" My lord, come with me, and I will receive you in my castle,
for which I am your liegeman, until such time as your troops
shall have assembled, in order that you may take vengeance
on those who have always held you in hatred." Accordingly,
the said John believed him, and entered his castle in safety
from the before-named Walter. 90 But when he wished to de-
90 It is stated " Hugh," probably by mistake.






A.D. 1201. LETTEE OF POPE INNOCENT. 533

part therefrom, Hugh would not let him depart ; indeed, he
had taken him for the purpose of delivering him up to the
king of England, who had long wished to take him. However,
the men of the said John did not cease night and day to ravage
with fire, sword, and famine the lands of the said Walter and
Hugh de Lacy, until they had delivered their lord, John de
Courcy, from the custody of the said Hugh de Lacy.

In the same year, John, king of England, wishing to challenge
the barons of Poitou with treachery to himself and to his brother,
hired many men, and took with him persons well skilled in the
art of fighting in single combat, and chosen from his territories
on both sides of the sea. But the barons of Poitou, being warned
thereof, would not come to his court ; saying that they were an-
swerable to no one but to their father. 91 And thus, the king of
England, being baulked of his hopes, returned to Normandy,
and the men of Poitou from this time became still more hostile
to him. For the purpose of quelling their violence, the king of
England appointed Robert de Turnham his deputy.

In the same year, Master Honorius claimed the archdeaconry
of Richmond against Roger of Saint Edmund's, and obtained
a letter from our lord the pope Innocent upon the subject, to
the following effect :

The Letter of pope Innocent to the dean and chapter of York, in
favour of Master Honorius.

" Innocent, the bishop, servant of the servants of God, to
his dearly beloved sons, the dean and chapter of York, health
and the Apostolic benediction. Our dearly beloved son, Master
Honorius, the archdeacon of Richmond, has signified unto us,
that whereas he has on many occasions shown obedience and
ready duteousness to our venerable brother the archbishop of
York, the archbishop, returning him bad for good, and repaying
love with hatred, has in many ways molested him, contrary to
the dignities and liberties of his archidiaconal office ; and that,
at length, in order to injure him still further, and to aggravate
him still more, he has raised his adversary, Roger of Saint Ed-
mund's, a clerk, with whom the said Master Honorius had
made a compromise, to the said office ; who, on the pretext of
letters obtained to our dearly beloved sons, the abbats of Saint
Edmund's and Sibbeton, and the prior of Norwich, by a con-
cealment of truth, is in many ways molesting him. Wherefore,

91 Perhaps this means the pope.



534 ANNALS OF BOGEB, DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1201.

inasmuch as we have made it our care to revoke the said let-
ters, as being surreptitiously obtained, and directed to judges
who lie under our suspicion, we do, by these Apostolic writings,
command and enjoin your discreetness, to make it your care
to defend and maintain the said Master Honorius in his rights;
and so to assist him as your fellow-brother and companion,
that for so doing, you may merit our commendation, and he
himself may, as a matter of duty, be rendered still more at-
tached to you."

The Letter of pope Innocent to the bishop of Ely and the arch-
deacon of Northampton.

" Innocent, the bishop, servant of the servants of God, to
his venerable brother, the bishop of Ely, and to his dearly-be-
loved son, the archdeacon of Northampton, health and the
Apostolical benediction. When our dearly beloved sons, Master
Honorius, archdeacon of Richmond, and Master Columbus, our
subdean, and the delegates of our venerable brother, the arch-
bishop of York, came to the Apostolic See, we thought proper
considerately to give them audience in our consistory. On
part of the said archbishop it was alleged, that the institution
of ecclesiastical personages and the care of vacant churches in
his diocese belongs to him both by common law, as also by
general custom ; but that, some of his predecessors had en-
trusted to some of the archdeacons personally, both the institution
as well as the care [of churches], though they still retained the
same for some time in their own hands, and freely enjoyed the
same, as was their right ; just as the archbishop, who is now set
over the church of York, by special favour formerly granted the
same to the archdeacon of Richmond, at the prayer of Richard,
king of the English, of famous memory, who having been after-
wards elected bishop, the archbishop then retained possession
of them as his own ; and that, when it was his intention to
confer the said archdeaconry on the before-named master, both
before he conferred the same, as also on the conferring thereof,
he expressly stated that he reserved in his own hands the right
of institution as also the care [of vacant churches] ; on which,
the archdeacon made answer, that he should be acting against
God, and in derogation of canonical rights, if he should pre-
sume to usurp the right of institution to churches, which
belonged to the archbishop alone. And that, then renounc-
ing those rights, he reduced his renunciation thereof to writ-



A.D. 1201. LETTER OF POPE INNOCENT. 535

ing, and, for the sake of greater precaution, by his own
seal corroborated the same, and finally gave his corporeal oath
that he would in nowise intermeddle therewith. In answer
to this, the archdeacon himself stated, that, when Henry the
First, of glorious memory, king of England, wished to create
a new episcopal see at Carlisle, because by that step the arch-
deaconry of Richmond received injury, that king requested one
of the archbishops of York, of blessed memory, by way of re-
compense for some portion of what was withdrawn from the
said archdeaconry, to grant the before- mentioned dignities
thereto ; on which, the archbishop acceded to his requests, and
presented the rights of institution, as also the care [of vacant
churches], not personally to the then archdeacon, but by a
real and free grant, with the consent of the chapter of York,
to the archdeaconry for ever ; and that, whereas the said arch-
deaconry had been in continuous possession thereof, as also
of other privileges, in the times of many archbishops, kings,
and archdeacons, and the archbishop so often named, with-
out any condition being made, granted him the same, after
having so conferred it, the said archbishop asserted that he had
given the same with all its liberties, the right of institution
and the care of vacant churches excepted. That he, however,
knowing full well the habit of the said archbishop, easily to give,
and speedily to repent, and fearing lest if he should expressly
contradict him, inasmuch as he had not yet gained possession
of the archdeaconry, either his obtaining the same might be
altogether hindered, or might for a long time be put off, made
answer that 93 not only about that matter, but as to all his
revenues as well, he would act in such manner as should be
agreable to the archbishop. That, after he had entered into
possession of the archdeaconry, he freely enjoyed the liberties
thereof, as his predecessors had been in the habit of doing.
That afterwards, when, contrary to all justice, the archbishop
had deprived him of the said archdeaconry, and he could in no
way obtain restitution thereof, without by deed renouncing the
said privileges, he, knowing that his right would still hold good,
being thus despoiled, gave to the archbishop himself, a letter of
renunciation thereof, sealed with his own seal ; but that he
never did, as alleged by the other side, abjure the same, but,

93 A rather unbecoming defence to be made by a minister of religion
before the pope, notwithstanding the opinion of pope Alexander, mentioned
in the next page.



536 ANNALS OF ROGEE DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1201.

on the contrary, with the object of obtaining the benefit of
restitution, enjoyed the same privileges as before, although the
said archbishop, in manifold ways, aggrieved him and his clerks
in relation thereto and to other matters, after appeal had been
lawfully interposed. That, the grant of the before-mentioned
liberties was not as it were that of one person to another per-
son, but the same 94 were rather granted as it were by the
actual dignitary himself, and were delivered, not by special
favour to any individual, but as a matter of right, together
with the archdeaconry, of the entirety of which, they doubtless,
from the original gift made by way of compensation, formed a
part. That, although any archbishop might perhaps enjoy the
same while he held the archdeaconry in his own hands, still,
no prejudice could be produced thereby to the archdeaconry,
as it is understood as a matter of course that they are afterwards
granted therewith. 95 Moreover, inasmuch as, by the council of
Tours, all withholdings of prebends, dignities, and benefices,
are prohibited, and the council of Lateran, where it forbids new
taxes to be imposed, or old ones to be increased, adds thereto,
' Let no one presume to appropriate to his own use any part of
the revenues,' it is evident that the archbishop ought not to,
and cannot, deprive the archdeaconry of any of its dignities and
privileges. That besides, it cannot be believed that before the
grant [of the office], or on the occasion of the grant, it was
agreed that the archbishop should retain possession of the afore-
said privileges, because, if he had chanced to attempt thus to
usurp possession of what did not belong to himself, he would
have seemed to be incurring the guilt of simony. That his
renunciation could not injure the archdeacon, as he had re-
nounced the same when despoiled thereof, and that pope Alex-
ander, of blessed memory, our predecessor, asserted that a
renunciation of that nature is not valid. Besides, although
the collation to the archdeaconry belongs to the said archbishop,
the entirety thereof belongs to the dignities of the church of
York, and neither the archbishop nor the archdeacon could,
without the consent and knowledge of the chapter of York,
inflict so great an injury upon the dignities and privileges of the
said archdeaconry. With reference to these points, the other
side replied, that although renunciation or abjuration might
not injure the archdeaconry, still, in consequence thereof, the

94 This passage is evidently imperfect.

85 " In ipsa" seems to stand for " in ipso."



A.D. 1201. LETTER OF POPE INNOCENT. 537

archdeacon was deprived of all means of attempting to recover
the same. To this, however, the archdeacon made answer, that
he was not attempting to recover the same, inasmuch as he was
freely exercising them, just as formerly, at the time when he
set out on his way to the Apostolic See, and was in enjoyment
of the possession thereof. He also added, that inasmuch as
the archbishop had, by shamefully retaining the dignity in his
hands against the law of the constitution [of the Church], mu-
tilated the same, he ought not, alleging, as it were, his own
infamy, to be heard against him, the possessor thereof, on the
point of his subsequent renunciation, or even his abjuration,
if such there had been. Accordingly, after hearing what was
alleged on both sides, and fully understanding the same, we
pronounced that the archdeacon must be left in full possession
of the privileges of the said archdeaconry, until it should have
been proved by the other side, that the said liberties had been
conceded [personally] by the archbishops to the archdeacons; for
in such case, the archbishop would be at liberty, both before and
after, as well as at the moment of granting [the archdeaconry],
lawfully to make reservation thereof, as being his own ; or else,
until it should have been lawfully proved that the archdeacon
had abjured the said privileges ; but that in the latter case, if
the concession of them 96 was a valid one, no right or benefit
could accrue to the archbishop thereby, for that we, on petition
of the church of York, or of ourselves, should consult the be-
nefit of the said archdeaconry thereon. If, therefore, either of
these positions shall be lawfully proved, let silence be im-
posed upon the archdeacon as to the said privileges ; if nei-
ther, then upon the archbishop. "We do therefore strictly
command, and by these Apostolic writings enjoin you, forth-
with to call the said parties before you, and to hear what
shall be alleged on both sides, according to the form in
the precedents set forth; always remembering, that if any
change has been made by the archbishop or his people rela-
tive to the said privileges since appeal was lawfully inter-
posed, or since the archdeacon set out upon his way to Rome,
you are, at the commencement of the investigation, all power
of appeal withheld, to replace the same in its former state :
and you are, all obstacle by appeal removed, to bring the
same to a due conclusion, if you shall be unable, by the con-
sent of the parties, to settle the same ; or else, you are to refer

the case, fully drawn up, to us for decision. If we were to have
due regard to the doings of our venerable brother the arch-
bishop of York, and wished to answer him, in accordance with
his deserts, we should not only deprive him of the power of
inflicting injury, but should even curtail his authority, who
thus misuses it for oppressing those subject to him. For how
and how long he has annoyed our dearly-beloved son Honorius,
the archdeacon of Richmond, whom, in consideration of his
learning and his integrity, he ought to have honored, the com-
plaints of the archdeacon have fully shown to us ; for he has both,
as he therein asserts, for some time, without cause, deprived
him of his archdeaconry, and has frequently, at the impulse
of his own will, launched against him and his clerks, and
others as well, sentence of excommunication and suspension.
Consequently, if we made it our care duly to provide for the
welfare of the said archdeacon, we should take care to pro-
nounce him for ever exempt from the jurisdiction of the said
archbishop, as one of our predecessors is known in his time
also to have exempted certain persons. However, it being our
wish so to protect the archdeacon, as not for the present to
curtail the authority of the said archbishop, we do command
and enjoin you, upon our authorization, carefully to warn the
said archbishop, and to forbid him to presume, without mani-
fest and reasonable cause, and only in a reasonable manner, to
pronounce sentence of excommunication, suspension, or inter-
dict upon the said archdeacon, or his clerks or laymen, or
churches in his archdeaconry. But if he shall do so, you are,
supported by our authorization, to pronounce the sentences so
given, to be null and void in law, all power of appeal on his part
withheld ; and you are carefully to protect the archdeacon and
his people for the future against the excesses of the arch-
bishop, revoking as null and void, all power of appeal with-
held, whatever attempts, in his rashness, he shall think proper
to make against them. And further, if he shall disdain to
listen to your advice, we shall make it our care duly to pro-
vide against the same, not without confusion and disgrace to
himself and his advisers.'*

The Letter of pope Innocent on the same subject, to king John.

" Innocent, the bishop, servant of the servants of God, to
the illustrious king of the English, health and the Apostolic
benediction. It is the interest of your royal highness to pro-

tect churches and ecclesiastical persons in their rights, and
powerfully and lawfully to bridle the attempts of evil doers,
when striving to molest them. Wherefore, inasmuch as our
beloved son, Master Honorius, archdeacon of Richmond, is a
man so learned and so virtuous, that, not only from his learn-
ing and virtue, honor is reflected upon the church of York,
but his duteous services may possibly prove advantageous to
yourself, we do ask, advise, and exhort your serene highness in
the Lord (and the more urgently, inasmuch as we are aware
that he has attended not less diligently than faithfully to the
business committed to his charge by your serene highness at
our court,) to maintain and defend him in his rights, and not to
permit him or his clerks, in contravention of the privileges of
the archdeaconry of Richmond, to be aggrieved by molestation
on part of any person whatsoever. Tare well."

Another Letter of pope Innocent on the same subject.

" Our dearly-beloved son, Honorius, archdeacon of Richmond,
having come to our presence, and having presented to us his
petition, has shown to us that, whereas we did formerly entrust
to our dearly-beloved son, Peter, cardinal deacon and titular of
Saint Mary in Via Lata, legate of the Apostolic See, the adju-
dication of the questions which were moved against those who
had been intruded into the prebends and dignities of the
church of York, he, reserving to himself the final sentence
thereon, did entrust to our venerable brother, the bishop, and
our dearly-beloved sons, the dean and subdean of Lincoln, the
hearing of the charge which was made against Roger of Saint
Edmund's, in relation to the archdeaconry of Richmond. But
although, observing due and legal form, they would have pro-
ceeded to pronounce a definite sentence, at last, through the
mediation of the chapter of York, there was an amicable and
fair compromise effected, between Honorius, the archdeacon,
and the before-named Roger, which each party, on oath, pro-
mised to observe. However, shortly after, the said Roger, not
taking into consideration the compromise made, and the oath
which he had taken thereon, obtained letters from ourselves
against the said archdeacon, addressed to you, who, as he
asserted, attempted in many ways, contrary to justice, to
injure him. For he alleged that, whereas he had set out
to come to our presence, to set forth his legitimate excep-
tions, and had utterly declined you, son, abbat of Saint Ed-



540 ATTXALS OF ROGER DE HOVEDEIST. A.D. 1291.

mund's, as being suspected by him, both because the said [arch-
deacon] was on too close terms of intimacy with you, and because,
as he asserted, he himself is related to you by blood, as also
because you had manifestly shown favour towards the said arch-
deacon in relation to the said matters, and had shown opposi-
tion to the said Roger, by petitioning our most dearly-beloved
son in Christ, the illustrious king of England, and our vene-
rable brother, the archbishop of Canterbury, 97 although he had
offered to make good his objections to you, in presence of judges
chosen for the purpose, you, nevertheless, our sons, the abbat
of Sibbeton and the prior of Korwich, presumed, as it was
stated, to pronounce judgment. And, further, that whereas men-
tion was made unceasingly in our letters of the revenues that had
accrued from the archdeaconry, you, contrary to the laws and
canons, deprived him of the benefit of such command. On
the other hand, although the said archdeacon had objected in
our presence, that his said adversary was an excommunicated
person, and was ready to prove the same 98 within a competent
time, and to make corporeal oath that he had not made such alle-
gation as a cause for delay, you, nevertheless, not allowing the
exception, pronounced that he was not to be heard, unless he
should prove forthwith that which he had by way of objection
alleged. Wherefore, when the said archdeacon felt that he
was aggrieved by you " on these and other points, he appealed
to our presence, and set out on the road, for the purpose of
prosecuting his appeal. But you, as it is said, being by no
means withheld from taking cognisance of the cause, after
appeal made, proceeded therewith, both to the prejudice and
in favour of, the said archdeacon. Wherefore, inasmuch as
we wish no one, in contravention of justice, to be aggrieved,
and the bearing or decision of causes so to proceed, that
neither party may have a just cause for complaint, we do, by
these Apostolic writings, command your discreetness, that since,
if, in the letters which the said Roger obtained to you from us
no mention is made of the compromise that took place as to
the archdeaconry, and of the oath that was taken, because
he obtained the same by means of suppression of the truth,

97 Probably in favour of archdeacon Honoring.

98 To make any sense of this passage, which, like the greater part of
the letter, is evidently imperfect, it is clear that " hoc' must stand in
place of " non."

8a " Nobis" is clearly a misprint for " vobis."



A.D. 1201. LETTER OF POPE INNOCENT. 541

and because, according to the canonical sanctions, a lying suitor
ought to lose his suit, we will that the said letters shall have
no validity whatever. If also, you have refused to admit of
the lawful objections of the before-named archdeacon, and
have presumed, after appeal lawfully interposed, to take fur-
ther proceedings in the said cause, we do will nevertheless,
and do command you, entirely to desist from any further proceed-
ings in the said cause, and to pronounce what has been done
by you therein to be utterly null and void. We do also will,
that the cause itself shall be placed in the hands of such judges
as ought to be suspected by neither party, or else shall be ter-
minated before ourselves, due justice being done therein. And
if you shall chance to neglect our commands, in consequence of
the favour or fear of any person, know that we, by our letters,
have commanded our venerable brother, the bishop of Roches-
ter, and our dearly-beloved sons, the abbat of Foxley and the
prior of Leeds, learning the truth thereon, to perform our com-
mands, all obstacles whatsoever, by way of contradiction or of
appeal, removed. Given at the Lateran, on the thirteenth day
before the calends of January, in the third year of our ponti-
ficate."

Another Letter of pope Innocent on the same subject.

" Innocent, the pope, to the abbats, priors, deans, parsons,
sheriffs, clerks, and laymen throughout the archdeaconry of
Eichmond appointed, greeting. Our dearly-beloved son, Master
Honorius, your archdeacon, has explained to us that whereas he
had canonically obtained the archdeaconry of Richmond, and had
for some time been in possession thereof, a disagreement after-
wards ensuing between him and our venerable brother, the
archbishop of York, Roger of Saint Edmund's, a clerk, calling
himself the archdeacon of Richmond, keeping silence on the
truth of the matters aforesaid, obtained letters from us to our
dearly-beloved sons, the abbats of Saint Edmund's and of Saint
Benedict de Holwey, 1 and to the prior of Tofts, directing them,
having first given you warning, by ecclesiastical censure, all
power of appeal withheld, to compel you to show to him all
obedience and respect, and to make him satisfaction for the in-
juries that had been done to nim. But, inasmuch as a lying suitor
ought, according to lawful enactment, to lose his suit, we do, by
these Apostolic writings, enjoin and command the whole of you

1 The abbat of Sibbeton and the prior of Norwich previously named.



512 AXXALS OF ROGEK DE HOVEDEN. A.D. 1201.

that, inasmuch as we have commanded the said letters to be re-
voked, as being obtained and sent to judges held in suspicion, by
means of the suppression of truth and the assertion of falsehood,
inviolably preserving the rights of the said archdeacon, you will,
the said letters notwithstanding, all power of appeal with-
held, show to him and his officers due obedience and respect,
just as you paid the same to him before he set out on his road to
the Apostolic See. And if not, such sentence as he or his officers
shall think proper reasonably to pronounce upon you for the
same, we do will to be ratified by us, and inviolably observed."
Accordingly, upon the presentation of these and other letters
of our lord the pope, which Honorius produced, Roger of Saint
[Edmund's making answer thereto, the judges delegate above-
named, in consequence of the appeals made by both parties,
and of the varying testimony of witnesses, having drawn up
the case to the best of their ability, sent the cause to our lord the
pope, to be determined by him ; and the said Honorius and
Hoger prosecuted their appeals.

TJie Letter of the Master of the Hospital at Jerusalem to the Prior
and his brethren throughout England.

" The Master of the Hospital at Jerusalem to the Prior of
England, greeting. As rumours transpire, it is our desire to
inform the minds of our friends thereof. Accordingly, in con-
formity with our usual custom, we were sending you the ru-
mours that were circulating in the land of Jerusalem on the
mournful occasion of the lately attempted passage ; but, the ship
being wrecked on the sea-coast of Tripolis, before Biblius, the
bishop of Acre, and many most deserving men among our
brethren, who had been despatched to you upon the affairs of
the Holy Land, it so pleasing God, to the grief and sorrow of
the whole people of Christendom, perished, together with many
pilgrims both of noble and of the lower rank. Since this ship-
wreck, we believe that no ship has made a passage, at least it is
so said by all ; for some ships, on board of which were our
messengers, making the attempt to proceed upon the voyage,
after leaving Acre and sailing three days or more, having lost
their sailyards through the usual violence of the winds and the
tempests, returned to Tripolis, with great difficulty escaping ship-
wreck. Having, however, obtained such opportunity as we could,
of a ship sailing, we have to inform your brotherhood, that that
most wicked enemy of the Christians, Saphadin, the lord of Da-



A.D. 1201. LETTEB OF THE MASTEE OF THE HOSPITAL. ,543

mascus, has been made lord of Babylon, for, like a perndious and
perjured man, he has expelled his nephew and others, whose
rights to the succession he dreaded, from the kingdom of Baby-
lon. There still nourish between him and the Sultan Aleph,
and many others, great dissensions, which can never come to
an end, and will never cease or fade away. Saphadin also,
himself, being odious and abominable to his own followers, is
in dread of domestic treachery, and, thinking himself safe in no
place (as he has proved a traitor and perjured to his nephews,
whom he is attempting also utterly to disinherit), does not dare
go out of Babylon, a thing which, in the last year, has proved
our safety and protection. For he had, in his boisterous manner,
and going beyond all bounds, been making preparations to
overrun us, and utterly to demolish the remnants of Christianity
that still remained. But God has struck with the rod of His
power the regions of Babylon in that river of Paradise, 2 which
used to water the lands of the enemy, so as to cause it not to now,
and in the past year it has sent forth no stream. In conse-
quence of this, they are perishing by famine, and have lost
their animals ; many of them have not scrupled to sell their
sons, the rich the poor, the powerful the weak, that so they
may preserve their lives from the famine, which they ap-
prehend will be the result of the river being dried up, if it does
not flow. Any prudent person indeed might imagine this, that
if the river, by the will of God, should not flow, and thereby
irrigate the fields, they will be in great danger of their lives.
Consequently, infinite multitudes, compelled by necessity and
the severity of famine, have now filled our lands like swarms of
locusts, for the purpose of sustaining their bodies ; where some
moil 3 at the soil belonging to the Church, some, after the manner
of beasts, feed upon the shrubs in the woods, while others, dying
of hunger, are found in spots in the woods wondrously eaten
away by worms and birds. Wherefore, we, putting our trust
in the Lord, who, when He wills, puts an end to battles, do
hope that He is about to make a beginning of shewing com-
passion upon the Christian people, when He thus bruises their
enemies. There is also afforded matter for astonishment among
the nations, in that, a certain Saracen, of youthful age and of low

degree, having been brought up in simplicity among shepherds
from his youth, has on a 'sudden appeared to all so learned, that
all are in admiration of his wisdom ; he also publicly preaches
the name of Jesus Christ, and so successfully, that already,
more than two thousand of the pagans have believed in him,
and, at his exhortations, have become converted to our faith,
and have been born again at the font of holy baptism, and
grieve that they submitted to the pain of circumcision. How-
ever, our enemies are exulting with unbounded joy, because
they know that we are but few in number, and impoverished
in means, and think that we are in want of troops. Where-
fore, unto you do we cry with the voice of lamentation, and
do piteously entreat you, that, among both the higher and the
lower classes, you will think us worthy to be aided by your
counsel and assistance, and will make it your care promptly
to induce our lord the king of England, and whatever other
persons you can, to aid us, and diligently advise them to
come to our succour. For we tremble on account of their in-
finite resources, and the more so, as their wealth is increased
by the merchandize brought by many merchants, a circumstance
which strikes us all with greater alarm than usual ; and con-
sidering that, whereas against the single kingdom of Babylon
or of Damascus the whole people of the Land of Promise
used to be hardly able to defend itself, at the present time two
kingdoms, joined under one master, by their threats inspire
terror in us, a residue so small in number. This is assuredly
the true state of the Land of Promise and of the enemies of
Christ; which, if it remained as at present, if we were to
receive sufficient aid from Christendom, we should with the
propitious favour of heaven, suppose ourselves able to avenge
both the injuries of Christ and the disgraces of the Christians.
Wherefore, good brother, as it suffices to say but little, you, know-
ing full well what necessities and how great are imposed upon
us, hear now what beyond measure afflicts us. The land of the
kingdom of Sicily is being ravaged both by the Germans and
the Lombards, our house at Baroli has been deserted, our breth-
ren remain within, [shut up] in the city ; our houses outside,
from which we received our support, have been brought to ruin,
and no one is for staying in the city. Moreover, since you left the
land, we have had no assistance whatever from the kingdom of
Sicily up to the present time, and for this year past we have
had to buy corn, wine, barley, flesh-meat, cheese, and all neces-



A.D. 1201. LETTEIi OF THE EABL OF ESSEX. 545

saries for the whole of our houses and fortresses, upon all which
the necessary outlay has been incalculable. TJnless we shall
receive some money from our houses beyond sea, we shall be
unable to obtain it elsewhere ; and it is now a long time since
we have received anything whatever for the support of our ex-
penditure. Know also, that we have incurred a great number
of debts ; and, awaiting your help and that of our other good
brethren, we do, by the love of God and our own, entreat you,
so far as you can, by the first ship that makes her passage in
the month of March, to send us some assistance. Farewell."

On hearing of this, our lord the pope Innocent sent a car-
dinal to the king of France and to the king of England, request-
ing that assistance might be given by their territories towards
the relief of the land of Jerusalem; and accordingly, at his
command the said kings agreed to give towards the relief of
the land before-mentioned the fortieth part of all their revenues
for one year. This the king of England ordered to be given
from his rents, his escheats, and his wardages in England ; and
he ordered that all the laymen of his territories should, in like
manner, give the fortieth part of their revenues, as an alms-gift
for the succour of the land of Jerusalem. Upon this occasion,
Geoffrey Fitz-Peter, at this time chief justice of England, wrote
to the sheriffs and bailiffs of England to the following effect :

The Letter of Geoffrey Fitz-Peter as to the collection of the
fortieth part of revenues for the succour of the Holy Land.

" Geoffrey Fitz-Peter, earl of Essex, to all the sheriffs in his
jurisdiction, greeting. Know ye, that our Lord the king of
England, at the instance and at the preaching of a certain
cardinal sent into France by the Supreme Pontiff, has, from
the parts beyond sea, 4 by the advice of his nobles, granted, for
the succour of Holy Jerusalem, the fortieth part of the value
of all his revenues and lands for one year, including those
accruing from wards and escheats in his hands. The same
also has been voluntarily contributed by his nobles them-
selves beyond sea. At their instance also, our lord the king
of England has, by his letters patent, written to all the
nobles of England, begging and entreating that they will,
with pure heart, and from motives of Christian love, make a
like grant from the value of all their revenues and lands for
the space of one year ; which, however, is neither conceded nor

demanded as a matter of right, or of custom, or of compul-
sion, or as based upon any other 5 Apostolical authority what-
ever. Wherefore, he has ordered that all the earls and barons
in each jurisdiction shall immediately be advised and carefully
urged, forthwith, each for himself, to make the said collection
on his lands, in the following manner, namely; each is to
contribute the fortieth part of the value of each vill that
belongs to him, according to the sum at which it might be let
to farm per annum. And if in the said vill there shall happen
to be any tenants by knight service, they are to contribute the
fortieth part in manner aforesaid : and if there shall be free-
holders, they are likewise to pay a similar portion in man-
ner aforesaid, on a computation of the annual rent which
they are paying to their lords. This collection also they
are to make by means of discreet and lawful persons, who
both can and understand how, to perform the same, and who
are to receive it from the earls and barons aforesaid. And
after the same shall have been collected by their hands, the
receivers of the said collection are to have it reduced dis-
tinctly and openly to writing how much they have received
from each person, both earls as well as barons, knights, and
freeholders ; as also the names of each, and of the vills, and
how much they have received from each, and to whom each
vill belongs ; all which they are to have duly registered. The
sums also, received from the demesnes, and from the wards,
escheats, and rents of our lord the king, they are to have
separately registered. Also, if any clerk shall have a lay fee
in any jurisdiction, or any tenants holding a lay fee, the said
collection is to be made upon their lands by the said col-
lectors in manner aforesaid. On the lands also of those who
have assumed the cross, the said collection is to be made in
manner aforesaid, but so that the money received from them
is set apart from the rest ; and the amount of the said money
is to be set down, and the names of each person by whom the
said money shall have been so paid is to be written beneath it,
in order that those who shall have set out on the expedition,
may promptly receive repayment of their money. Also, due
care is to be taken that the said money is so collected, that
each sheriff, together with the collectors, has it in readiness
at the New Temple, in London, within fifteen days after the
day of Saint Hilary, as also a register drawn up in manner
5 Than the suggestion of the cardinal legate.

aforesaid, that is to say, stating the amount of the money, the
names of those who have paid it, the names of the vills from
which the said money has been paid, and how much has been
paid by each. And if any persons shall refuse to give their
consent to the said collection, their names are to be entered
in the register, and made known to us at London at the time
aforesaid; and the present writ and the names of the col-
lectors are to be there presented. Farewell. "
